<i>If I'm honest, I saw red flags</i>

20
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621

He doesn't know what I look like,

148
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,783
so he won't know that you're just
some random asshole

Okay, okay.

152
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,958
Okay, hold... hold on, hold on. You...

153
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,877
You charge a fee...

in advance of meeting.

155
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,467
You didn't give him his money back.

156
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,430
That is probably correct.

157
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,806

And my earning potential
is somewhat curtailed by being in a cage.

<i>It's no problem.</i>

<i>It's just 2,700 more than I had</i>

165

<i>due to the lack of planning
that preceded my departure.</i>

<i>Teach him how to make a counterfeit book,</i>

<i>and maybe, just maybe...</i>

170
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,176
<i>he can cobble together
a little something worth...</i>

171
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,260
Three grand.

172
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,679
Best I can do.

[Joe sighs]

174
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,725
Three grand it is.

175
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,894
[Joe]<i> I'll admit, bar was low.</i>

176
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,439
<i>Mooney would have thrown the thing
back at me, had me do it 50 more times.</i>

177
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,110
<i>Fortunately, an LA bookseller
is practically an oxymoron.</i>

178
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,784
<i>At least now I'd be able
to send this Jasper fella on his way,</i>

179
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,161
<i>get back to our story:</i>

180
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,662
<i>you...</i>

181
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,873
<i>the person who may</i>

182
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,084
<i>just make paying a $3,000 toll</i>

183
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>to stay in this urban Gomorrah</i>

184
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,003
<i>worth it.</i>

185
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,256
<i>If only you weren't such an early riser.</i>

186
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>It's becoming clear,</i>

187
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,719
<i>the more I see of you,</i>

188
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,223
<i>the harder it is to see you clearly.</i>

189
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,558
<i>If I don't want to get hurt,</i>

190
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>I have to keep a distance
till I've done my due diligence.</i>

191
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,603
[Love] Hey!

192
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,855
[Love giggles]

193
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,816
You keep wandering off. Here.

194
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,945
[Joe] <i>Though that's hard
when you keep inviting me to things.</i>

195
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,655
I just didn't want to get in your way.

196
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh, that's impossible.

197
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,825
Wow!

198
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,827
Look at that opah.

199
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,931
- Is that Ecuadorian or local? Thank you.
- [seller] Local.

200
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,166
[stuttering] I know you're making
all of this up to impress me.

201
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,450
You don't have to try so hard.

202
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,462
If you told me that fish was an alien,
I would believe you.

203
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,755
[Love laughs]

204
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,007
No, that's why it's good
you took me up on this.

205
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,331
For a guy who works at Anavrin,

206
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,720
you sorely lack an understanding
of the pescatarian lifestyle. [giggles]

207
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,764
I'm a pescatarian ignoramus.

208
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,270
Are you okay? You look a little...

209
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,854
Mmm.

210
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,364
- [Love giggles]
- [Joe]<i> No.</i>

211
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>Too soon, too much, too good.</i>

212
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,619
Yeah, I just wanted to stop
thinking about it and just do it.

213
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,412
Interested?

214
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,416
Hate the idea?

215
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,959
I'm sorry, what did you say?

216
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,127
Lunch today.

217
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,421
My friends.

218
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,424
I think we should
just rip the Band-Aid off.

219
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,594
They're very LA, but they're also great,

220
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,763
and... they're important to me.

221
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,513
So...

222
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,017
[Joe]<i> And now you want me to meet
your friends?</i>

223
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,646
<i>I really, really need
a clinical distance. No.</i>

224
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,563
I'd love to.

225
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,647
[Joe]<i> Shit.</i>

226
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,907
[Forty echoing] Earth to Spock.

227
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,075
Come in, Spock.

228
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,661
[chuckles] Where'd you go, old sport?

229
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,497
You had that look
like when Keanu sees the black cat.

230
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,291
"Oh. Glitch in the Matrix."

231
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
[Joe]<i> We kissed and I saw the ghost
of Guinevere Beck,</i>

232
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,879
<i>my Matrix </i>is<i> glitching.</i>

233
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,089
[chuckles] Yeah.

234
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,507
Yeah, uh, no.

235
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,633
I'm... I'm fine, thanks.

236
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,716
You know what?

237
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,969
Let's see here.

238
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,890
How about we move the women's lit display?

239
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,642
Like, why are we separating them?

240
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,143
That's sexist.

241
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,061
Right?

242
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,148
And besides, I woke up
with a completely brilliant idea.

243
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,652
- What's the idea?
- Movies.

244
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,697
- On loop in... in the bookstore.
- [Joe] <i>Oh, no.</i>

245
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,448
Movies that are... wait for it...

246
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,200
also books.

247
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,327
[Joe]<i> Kill it with fire.</i>

248
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
It's a great idea.

249
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,081
- Dope movies like <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>
- [Joe]<i> Not based on a book.</i>

250
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,044
- Whichever of the <i>Star Wars...</i>
- [Joe]<i> Again...</i>

251
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,876
<i>Fifty Shades,</i> obviously.

252
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,546
[Joe]<i> One for three, marginally.</i>

253
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,049
We are gonna sell so many books,
it is going to blow your fucking mind.

254
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,177
- Can't wait.
- So just come clean this up,

255
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,470
set up the screen,

256
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,223
and when it all looks so cute
you wanna fuck it,

257
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,849
holla at your boy.

258
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,392
Namaste.

259
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,606
[Calvin] I'm sorry,

260
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,707
did you think this was a real bookstore?

261
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,444
Bless your heart.

262
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,154
It's cute.

263
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,081
Hey, Bettelheim?

264
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,666
[Ellie]<i> Jasper.</i>

265
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,713
He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back.

266
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,423
[Joe]<i> This is Jasper?</i>

267
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>He looks like a manager
at a comic book store.</i>

268
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,093
Sorry, who you looking for?

269
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,346
Well, you, Mr., uh, Will B. [chuckles]

270
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,692
Girl at your apartment
said you worked here.

271
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,476
Did she mention that I left word for you?

272
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,145
I'm... I'm sorry. [chuckles] I'm Jasper.

273
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,439
Oh, right. Man, I have been
having trouble reaching you.

274
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,317
I'm sorry, my phone's been weird,
you know?

275
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,777
But here, your money.

276
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Here.

277
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,946
[scoffs]

278
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,450
- It should all be there.
- All 50 grand?

279
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,744
[Joe]<i> I'm sorry, 50?!</i>

280
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,704
That's some of it,
I got to liquidate the rest.

281
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,706
Oh. Oh, it's okay. [laughs]

282
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,250
But I'll need it today.
Is that still all right?

283
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,084
That's great.

284
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,878
Perfect.

285
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,172
[Jasper chuckles]

286
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,715
Hey, one other thing, uh...

287
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,799
- Sure.
- Check this out.

288
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,201
- Wanna show you something.
- What?

289
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,302
What are you doing?

290
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,473
- [Joe grunting]
- [shushes]

291
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
It's okay, it's okay. Squeeze hard.

292
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,268
Right at the knuckle, a little higher.

293
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,270
Good. Good, good, good, good good.

294
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,479
Now...

295
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,232
I'm gonna need you to...

296
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,859
just gotta hold that for me.

297
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,611
Great, and, uh...

298
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,488
drop her in there.

299
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,614
There you go.

300
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,243
Now, over at St. Henry's
they have a fantastic microsurgeon,

301
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
Dr. Daniel.

302
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,371
As long as you're there
in the next 10, 12 hours,

303
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,831
good chance it'll reattach.

304
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
Provided you have this. So...

305
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,375
give me a call
when you have the rest of the money.

306
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,587
Probably sooner
better than later, I'd think.

307
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,661
Good to finally meet you, Will.

308
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,012
[Joe exclaims in pain]

309
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,597
[Joe]<i> This is bad.</i>

310
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,891
<i>Easily leave-town bad.</i>

311
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,645
<i>But this is your town, Love,
and I can't leave you.</i>

312
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,064
[storage door rattles]

313
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,193
It's 50 thousand, Will! It's not three!

314
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,864
Can we please talk about
the <i>$47,000</i> discrepancy?

315
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,824
Can we talk about my hand?

316
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,492
[Joe]<i> Oh, no.</i>

317
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,828
[sobbing] I told you everything.

318
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,414
I told you everything,
and now it's too late.

319
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,834
[Joe]<i> I admit, I thought
his whole "needing meds" thing</i>

320
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,751
<i>was a ploy.</i>

321
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,044
Fuck Jasper.

322
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,798
He's just some asshole
Russian mafia-adjacent wanker.

323
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,758
Were you even followed?

324
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,760
How would you even know,
you amateur!

325
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,054
They've found me and it's over

326
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,056
and you exposed us and now they're...

327
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,224
[Will sobs]

328
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,229
Oh... okay.

329
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,275
[breathing heavily]

330
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,486
Oh... Will?

331
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,530
[Will panting]

332
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,614
Hey, buddy.

333
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,701
Do you have any money anywhere?
Think, Will, think.

334
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Will, listen to me,
no one knows you're here.

335
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,250
No one can take care of you
if the guy you stole from murders me.

336
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
Am I making sense?

337
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,090
Rufus...

338
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,844
he owes me 50 large.

339
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
He's good, he just...

340
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,931
Text him the code word.

341
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,807
This is important.

342
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,434
When I was eight, I broke my arm,

343
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,062
and they put a pin in it
and it's been transmitting,

344
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,105
so don't you go to the hospital.

345
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,025
They will chip you like a dog,
you understand me?

346
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,945
Thank you so much for caring, Will.

347
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,698
I can and I will neutralize
that chip for you.

348
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,782
Okay.

349
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,494
What was that code word?

350
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,708
[Joe]<i> Apparently, Rufus is someone
who conveniently owes Will</i>

<i>While this feels too easy,</i>

354
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,092
<i>right about now the universe
owes me a little easy.</i>

355
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,805
<i>Spoke too soon.</i>

356
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>That's not gonna work.
I have a lunch with you.</i>

357
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,983
12-2.

358
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,193
[Joe]<i> And I hate Rufus.</i>

359
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,361
<i>Damn it.</i>

360
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,948
<i>I have to cancel our lunch, Love.</i>

361
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,497
<i>For the record, I'm opening sobbing.</i>

[buzzing]

363
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
- Hey.
<i>- Just calling to hear if you were crying.</i>

364
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,674
- You sound fine.
<i>- Crying on the inside.</i>

365
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,591
I'm sorry.

366
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,678
[Joe]<i> You're direct. You do what you feel.
You just pick up the phone.</i>

367
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,241
<i>I'm just sorry I'm not gonna see you.</i>

368
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,931
[Joe]<i> This is how you handle rejection.</i>

369
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,809
<i>You want me to not feel bad
about blowing you off.</i>

370
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,477
What can I say? Forty's a dick.

371
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,979
He sent me on a run to Alhambra

372
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,065
to get a sample of the competition's
compostable picnicware.

373
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,692
Forty said that?

374
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,405
Well, my coven's gonna be, uh...

375
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,074
sad they don't get to meet you today.

376
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>Yikes. Please don't let them hex me.</i>

377
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,953
<i>I'm sorry, I wanted to be there.</i>

378
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,621
Yeah, I know, me too.

379
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,789
Talk later, 'kay?

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,378
[Joe]<i> Wanted to be there so much I decided
I had to at least drop by, you know?</i>

381
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,674
<i>I don't have the time to join you,
but I can spare a few minutes.</i>

382
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,804
<i>Especially when I've learned
how friends say so much about a person.</i>

383
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,222
Will can't make it.

384
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,099
- He's sorry he can't be here.
- No.

385
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,393
[Joe]<i> Like how influenced you are
by their opinion,</i>

386
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,521
<i>- how much they secretly run your life.</i>
- [male friend] I'm bummed.

387
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,774
I was so ready
to meet your new man-friend.

388
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,942
And by "meet,"
Gabe means "judge and deem unworthy."

389
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,903
[Gabe] I'm sorry,
who are you talking about?

390
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,822
[Joe]<i> Lucy Sprecher.</i>

391

<i>She met Love at a rally for LGBTQ rights.</i>

392
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,286
<i>Back then, Lucy was an unpaid intern.</i>

<i>the Kates, and the EU's
top-selling Instagram poet.</i>

395
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,768
- [female friend] Okay, okay, okay!
- [Gabe] She is coming for me!

396
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,214
[Love's friends laughing]

397
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,800
Just ignore Lucy, she hates everyone.

398
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,636
Please ignore Sunrise.
She overcompensates for my bitch face.

399
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,471
Yeah, I do, babe. You're welcome.

400
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,099
- [Lucy] I love it.
- [Gabe] Okay. Okay, have you...

401
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,182
[Joe]<i> Here we go.</i>

They source it from this incredible

00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,208

<i>To Paris?</i>

430
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,462
- [Gabe] Oh, my God.
- [Love] Will and I kissed.

431
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,751
- You kissed?
- [Love] Yeah.

432
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,752
I love that.

433
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
I wish Will did,

434
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,215
'cause I'm pretty sure I scared him
and now he's avoiding me.

[Joe]<i> And this is it,
this is when I get annihilated.</i>

436
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,012
Well, then maybe he's an idiot
who should go fuck himself.

437
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,181
[Sunrise] Okay, or maybe he's shy.

438
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,266
Love can be a little forthright.

439
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,184
Compliment.

440
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,936
So maybe the idea of meeting
three more of us is genuinely scary.

441
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,646
You're soft.

442
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,940
- Am I too forthright?
- No.

- Real men love that shit.
- Right.

444
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,487
Let's focus on what
is actually important here.

445
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,323
Which is...?

446
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,036
That your heart maybe wants back
in the game.

447
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,081
Maybe it's time.

448
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,127
I just, um... like him.

449
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,711
Aww!

450
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,965

James much.

452
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,095
I just really thought, you know...

453
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,056
I met my soulmate,

454
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,391
and that's done, and...

455
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,020
so the rest of my life will be,
like, you know...

456

Oh, honey, I know.

like James.

462
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,952
But now I'll just be doing something...

463
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,080
- random and I'll miss Will.
- [Lucy] Aw!

464
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,123
- I don't even know him.

- [Gabe] Oh, no.

00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,380
No, I think that maybe...

467
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,840
maybe you're falling for him a tiny bit.

468
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,885
- That's so terrifying.

519
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,542
<i>Wait a second, this is Vacuum Guy?</i>

520
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,168
<i>Ethan loved this gag.</i>

521
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
<i>Oh!</i>

522
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,381
[audience laughing]

523
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,882
<i>Brexit!</i>

524
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,051
<i>Right?</i>

525
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
[Joe]<i> Apparently,</i>

526
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,432
<i>Hendy's got a hard-life-lessons
man-of-the-people thing working for him.</i>

527
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,605
Apartment three?

528
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,023
[Joe]<i> Oh, great.</i>

529
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,026
[chuckling]
Is this party gonna get any more weird?

530
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,237
- What happened to your hand?
- Uh... Oh, it's...

531
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,417
Oh, you're really not from here.
I asked, but I actually don't care.

532
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,506
I've been up for two days
chasing that whole Jared Padalecki thing,

533
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,121
but he's been laying low,
so I kind of detoured here

534
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,582
to find this hairstylist, Kido.

535
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,916
Word has it he can confirm...

536
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,462
[Joe]<i> Really couldn't care less about Kido
or why Delilah's here at all.</i>

537
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,756
<i>If anything, I've only got more reason
to get the hell out of here.</i>

538
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,152
...Rufus who knows the owner of this house
who's a producer

539
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,803
- and he knows Kido...
- Wait, I'm sorry, did you say Rufus?

540
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,847
Yeah, my girl Tanika knows him.

541
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,891
The friend I'm looking for
has a buddy, Rufus.

542
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,685
Could you...
could you maybe point him out for me?

543
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,770
You're kidding me.

544
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,148
[Hendy] Delilah.

545
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,277
Hey, long time.

546
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,278
You look great.

547
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,989
I look like a walking red-eye
from Pittsburgh, but you look great.

548
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,152
- What are you doing here?
- Just working on a piece.

549
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,737
'Course you are.
Always the smartest girl in the room.

550
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,871
Yep. It's exhausting.

551
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,205
Yeah.

552
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,504
What, d'you go for
the president's curly fries?

553
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,959
Sorry, this is Will.

554
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,420
Hi. No, it was an accident at work.

555
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,757
It might need surgery, but it's, uh,
you know, it's okay.

556
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,592
Well, if you do, Dr. Daniel

557
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,302
at St. Henry's Medical Center.

558
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,138
Uh, if you go, tell him we're friends
and he'll hook you up.

559
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,058
Thank you. Thanks.
Really, I appreciate that.

560
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,226
- Yeah.
- [woman] Hendy!

561
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,812
Uh... excuse me, guys.
Great to see you, gorgeous.

562
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,526
Well!

563
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,028
He seems pretty great.

564
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,864
Drool a little more,
it's a good look on you.

565
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,534
Did he come up in one of your pieces?

566
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,703
Meaning is there shit on him? Scoop?

567
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,957
- Inquiring minds want to know?
<i>- </i>Never mind. If you don't want...

568
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
Let me just give you
the <i>Idiot's Guide,</i> okay?

569
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,293
Being famous...

570
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,920
don't make you magic.

571
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,298
Cover shit in gold,
it's just super shiny shit.

572
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,262
[chuckling]
I had a feeling you might know that,

573
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,844
but I was wrong, and now I pity you.

574
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,597
- Excuse me.
- Hold on. You gonna point out Rufus?

575
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,961
You're a big boy. Figure it out.

576
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,809
- Hey.
- Yeah?

577
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,727
- Rufus would like his Negroni.
- All right.

578
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,853
Thank you.

579
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,821
Hi.

580
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,114
Excuse me.

581
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,324
Rufus?

582
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,576
Oh, you found me.

583
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,577
Yes.

584
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,495
Hey, lose the clothes if it's all right.

585
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,330
Hope you like Air Supply.

586
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,750
I'm kind of kind of
on a ballad jag right now. [chuckles]

587
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,920
- [Rufus clears throat]
- [guitar strumming]

588
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,761
You look different
than your picture on the app.

589
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,926
It's Todd, right?

590
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,929
[chuckles] Actually,
I'm here for "Battlestar."

591
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,557
- You're not Will.
- No.

592
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,267
He told me to use the code word.

593
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,810
I'm helping him out.

594
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,769
[Rufus laughs]

595
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,605
Here I'm about to blow you.

596
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,481
[Joe chuckles]

597
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,150
I got your shit in my bag.

598
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,530
There you go.

599
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,826
It's okay if I count it?

600
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,202
You shittin' me?

601
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,086
These are pills.

602
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,379
Same ones, man.

603
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,964
But faster acting.

604
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
I got a new source in Quebec.

605
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,551
What about the 50 grand?

606
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,968
The 50 grand?

607
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,641
Would you settle for that blowjob?

608
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,194
[Joe]<i> It turns out
Rufus has been supplying OG Will</i>

609
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,279
<i>with off-brand Canadian meds</i>

610
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,157
<i>for a rather severe bipolar disorder.</i>

611
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,284
<i>Explains so much.</i>

612
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,409
[gate slides open]

613
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,872
[Joe]<i> Evidently,
Will kept just enough of a grip</i>

614
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,624
<i>to turn me into his TaskRabbit.</i>

615
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
<i>But hey, he needs them.</i>

616
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,170
[Will] Nope, I won't take 'em. Flush 'em!

617
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,341
Keep your poison.

618
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,926
What do you mean?

619
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,178
I went to the Valley for you.

620
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,016
[Joe]<i> Farewell to that small part of Will
aspiring to sanity, I guess.</i>

621
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,975
You'll feel better.

622
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,020
Yeah, then you take 'em, fucker,
'cause I don't believe you.

623
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,022
You should believe me!

624
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,024
Believe me when I tell you...

625
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,235
I could hand you to Jasper.

626
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,445
I wouldn't have your problems anymore.

627
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,330
[Joe]<i> Learned something today.</i>

628
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,958
<i>Screaming at crazy</i>

629
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,584
<i>can reopen a wound.</i>

630
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>Love, this is trial by fire for you.</i>

631
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,552
[knocking on door]

632
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,364
[Love] Hey, I really think
we need to talk.

633
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,936
[Joe] Oh.

634
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,938
Hey.

635
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,398
Hey.

636
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,985
Oh, my God! What happened?

637
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,236
Oh, it's... it's nothing.

638
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,029
- Oh, no, what did you do?
- No, it's fine.

639
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,615
It's a cut, it's nothing.
What do you want to talk to me about?

640
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
You lied to me.

641
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,582
- What?
- Lunch.

642
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,083
Forty?

643
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,213
He's a bad alibi. He's been telling me
everything since we were born.

644
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,798
[Joe]<i> Shit.</i>

645
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,925
- Is Forty your brother?
- My twin brother.

646
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,637
And you called him a dick,
which he can be,

647
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,639
but you were also lying.

648
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,308
You own Anavrin.

649
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,645
[Joe]<i> That's what I get for not trying
to find out everything about you first.</i>

650
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,647
My parents own Anavrin.

651
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,483
I just work there.

652
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,903
I was trying not to instantly
complicate things

653
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,237
by waiting to tell you.

654
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,990
But you...
you complicated things by lying.

655
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,159
Why would you lie?

656
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,496
[Joe]<i> So I could walk through
fire for you.</i>

657
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,041
<i>So I could slay dragons to stay near you.</i>

658
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,960
- I just... I don't know you.
- Yet.

659
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,213
- You don't know me.
- Yeah, well, apparently.

660
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,714
Because I thought that we were...

661
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,010
I mean, we kissed, Will.

662
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,929
This is... This is not a good time.

663
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,430
This is not good timing.

664
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,975
This is about your ex, isn't it?

665
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,059
- [Joe]<i> Yes.</i>
- No.

666
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,980
She <i>really</i> hurt you.

667
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,607
[Joe]<i> I can smell your shampoo,</i>

668
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,610
<i>and nothing you're doing is making it
easier for me to see you clearly.</i>

669
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,071
But guess what? My husband hurt me, too.

670
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,490
Among other things, by dying.

671
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,910
So, I understand why this is hard for you,

672
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,663
but it's also why I just say things now.

673
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,875
'Cause there was things
I was waiting to say to him.

674
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,255
And I... I don't know
if this is just a fling

675
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,632
or something more, but either way...

676
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,941
I think it's a mistake to do
the bullshit thing that you're doing.

677
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,529
- No, it's not bullshit...
- Yes, it is!

678
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,138
You don't need to run away.

679
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,765
[Joe] Please, no.

680
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,600
- Stop.
- You can...

681
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,060
Please! Stop!

682
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,646
Just stop!

683
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,778
Okay.

684
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,906
You don't need to yell.

685
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,908
Ever.

686
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,122
I liked you. [sniffles]

687
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,294
This sucks.

688
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,046
[door closes]

689
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,383
[Beck] You're bleeding again.

690
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,016
Why are you here?

691
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,852
You've actually lost

It's not... [chuckles] Um...

874
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,147
You could just, you know, write a note.

875
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,524
A goodbye.

876
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,195
Burn it. [chuckles]

877
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,737
Something.

878
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,448
And I would help you.

879
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,369
Friends support each other.

880
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,205
[Joe]<i> Whatever you call us...</i>

881
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,541
<i>- it feels right.</i>
- [giggles]

882
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,377
<i>Because we're an "us."</i>

883
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,799
<i>And if we are an "us,"</i>

884
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,593
<i>then, dare I say it...</i>

885
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,094
<i>this...</i>

886
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,556
<i>this is home for now.</i>

887
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
<i>And I should probably be a good neighbor.</i>

888
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,937
[Delilah] Oh...

889
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,233
Try that guy.
These two are full and that one...

890
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,568
Eats the quarters, yeah.

891
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,613
You don't have to be all nice.

892
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,117
I feel bad, like I did something.

893
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,620
No, it's not you, you were just
in the line of fire when Henderson...

894
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,499
[Delilah sighs] We go back.
We met, like, eight years ago

895
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,459
when I was dancing at this bar downtown.

896
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,548
Not just to do it, but because I was
actually pursuing something.

897
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,582
I wanted to be Carrie Fisher.
She's such a great writer.

898
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,554
But I was stuck in Covina
and my mom was such a cunt,

899
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,389
and one day, I was just like, "Fuck it.

900
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,224
Let me get a fake ID and get out of here

901
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,559
and go follow my dreams."

902
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,769
[Joe]<i> It's hard to imagine her
with dreams.</i>

903
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,687
Henderson was cool.

904
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,357
He, like, gave me copies
of Syd Field, <i>Save the Cat.</i>

905
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,444
And he was like, "You're actually good,"

906
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,612
which nobody ever...

907
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,076
And I had heard, or whatever,

908
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,329
that he had young girls around,

909
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,540
but I just thought
I was talented and special.

910
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,335
One day, I was at his place,

911
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,338
and I had, like, three sips of beer,

912
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,798
and I got so fucked up.

913
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,093
Eight years ago? You were, like...

914
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,386
Seventeen.

915
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,097
Anyway, I remember being like,

916
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,599
"How is it ten p.m.?"

917
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,976
And I look down and...

918
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,562
my skirt was pulled up.

919
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,732
So you're saying Henderson...

920
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,567
Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.

921
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,570
Have you ever tried...?

922
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,781
To what? Tell anyone? No.

923
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,365
Who?

924
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,951
I tried to do a story years later,
but nobody would talk to me.

925
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,995
Guess why? They're all like I was.

926
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,496
Underage...

927
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,872
strippers...

928
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,166
not white...

929
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,168
The world would eat them alive.

930
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,128
[Delilah sighs]

931
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,422
And that's why I don't lose
a drop of sleep

932
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,226
on any of these motherfuckers
I write about.

933
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,342
They all deserve it.

934
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,763
My math says 49% of humanity
deserves to die in a fire.

935
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,060
[chuckling] Don't do that. You, like...

936
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,604
You nod as if you're somehow
not one of them.

937
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,357
Well, let me give you the gift of honesty.

938
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,649
You...

939
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,277
act nice because you're not.

940
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,239
And I may not know
what kind of bad you are...

941
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,158
but I got my radar the hard way.

942
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,992
So...

943
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,288
stay the fuck away from me
and my sister, okay?

944
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,834
Have a fantastic day.

945
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,103
Tell me I didn't eat those.

946
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,065
Do you know...

947
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,652
how much oxidative stress
those things put on your body?

948
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,572
I'm guessing a shower
is out of the question?

949
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,923
Did you say Jasper came around?

950
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,507
I paid the man.

951
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,010
And he went on his way.

952
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,890
If things were different,
I'd say I owe you 50 grand.

953
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,093
- Why? You got it laying around somewhere?
- Nice try.

954
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:11,976
It's spent.

955
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,773
- What were you thinking?
- Honestly...

956
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,235
a little while ago I fell in love.

957
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,529
And she needed help.

958
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,032
So I just did it.

959
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,581
[Will chuckles softly]

960
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,336
You've been putting meds
in my drinks, huh?

961
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,419
That's green juice.

962
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,588
Thanks.

963
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,760
Well, my current reality is...

964
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,387
suboptimal, but even so,

965
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,889
upgrade from where I was.

966
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,851
At one point,
I thought I saw you murder a guy.

967
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,440
[Will chuckles]

968
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,107
Crazy town.

969
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,528
Well, glad to have you back.

970
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,082
[Joe]<i> I guess it's goodbye, Beck.</i>

971
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,627
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

972
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,754
<i>I really am.</i>

973
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,300
<i>Goodbye, you.</i>

974
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,180
How did that feel?

975
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,185
Like a good first step.

976
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,023
[Joe] <i>Still can't wait to tell our story
to our kids.</i>

977
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,360
<i>How we decided to walk before we ran.</i>

978
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,529
<i>Started out as friends.</i>

979
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,618
<i>The past...</i>

980
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,413
<i>is prologue.</i>

981
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,083
<i>I made mistakes, yes.</i>

982
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,961
<i>And I'll learn from them.</i>

983
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,754
<i>Prove...</i>

984
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,382
<i>I'm worthy...</i>

985
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,924
<i>of you.</i>

986
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,729
[Love] Hey, should I open another bottle?

987
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,075
[Joe]<i> I know we'll get there.</i>

988
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,661
<i>I'm optimistic.</i>

989
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,537
<i>It's just...</i>

990
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,249
<i>who I am.</i>

991
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,590
