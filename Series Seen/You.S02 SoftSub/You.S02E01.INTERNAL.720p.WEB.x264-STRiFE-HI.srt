I want you to know I want it to stay gone.

180
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,969
I mean, you sure thought I was dead

181
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,892
or you wouldn't have
just left me there, right?

182
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,432
I was prepared to count my blessings
and never come back.

183
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,875
That's not how any of it happened.

184
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,685
So, anyways, there I am,

185
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,312
in a new town,

186
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,063
a new girl,

187
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,649
and I walk into this store,

188
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,485
and there's this book...

189
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,988
by a woman named Guinevere...

190
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,364
Beck.

191
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,412
You did it again, didn't you?

192
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,999
What do you want, Candace?

193
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,545
To kill you with my bare hands.

194
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,757
I'm kidding. [scoffs]

195
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,800
I could never.

196
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,014
I'm gonna go to the cops,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

197
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,643
Nope, sorry, not that either.

198
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,978
Too easy on you.

199
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,782
[Joe]<i> People.</i>

200
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>People are predictable.</i>

201
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,285
<i>I cannot afford to be predictable.</i>

202
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,287
<i>My life depends on that.</i>

203
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>But love, love is what kept me open,</i>

204
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,669
<i>alive, different, real.</i>

205
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>And I also can't afford to do love,
so you see my dilemma.</i>

206
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>Lady, how many photos does it take?
Come on.</i>

207
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,552
Are you like, "Lady, come on.

208
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,970
How many photos does it take?"

209
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,390
Crazy thing is,
she never posts any of them.

210
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,101
That's, like, gotta be a diagnosis, right?

211
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,145
[Joe]<i> Precocious, unsupervised kid
who thinks she's not a kid.</i>

212
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,398
Ms. Strauss secretly has six chihuahuas

213
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,941
so she walks them in shifts.

214
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,568
And you?

215
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,529
You are Will Bettelheim,

216
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,071
LA newbie.

217
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,448
Yeah, that's me.

218
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,866
[Joe]<i> Who is protecting her?</i>

219
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,994
<i>No, no, she is not my problem.</i>

220
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,077
What's your Insta?

221
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,038
Or do you only have a Finsta?

222
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,040
- I'm a little behind the times.
- Clearly.

223
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,252
Anyway, I'm @Ellie-Eyeballs.

224
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,754
So...

225
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,463
you have a girlfriend yet?

226
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,967
[Joe]<i> Holy shit.</i>

227
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,719
Ellie, how old are you? Like 14?

228
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,011
Fifteen.

229
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,097
Basically 16, so...

230
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,725
[Joe stammering]
<i>No, she's not my problem.</i>

231
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
It was nice to meet you.

232
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,393
Cool.

233
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,062
Manners.

234
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,826
[woman] Thank you so much for stopping by.

235
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,941
[man] I appreciate being the first call.

236
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,235
So Delilah, she's not a hooker.

237
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,306
It's what you're thinking, right?

238
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,823
Yeah, no, she's a reporter,

239
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,991
that guy's a publicist,

240
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:21,120
and he just paid some crazy kill fee to
not run something about someone famous.

241
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,294
- It's sick, she's a genius.
- [Delilah] Ellie?

242
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,124
No harassing the tenants.

243
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,876
I'm not. We're old friends.

244
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,753
Well, you're late for school, smart-ass.

245
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,588
[Joe]<i> Too young to be Ellie's mom.</i>

246
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,090
Is that my shirt? That's my fucking shirt.

247
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,217
- How many times...?
- [Joe]<i> Sisters.</i>

248
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,721
Can you please not wear that to school
and destroy it, please?

249
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,015
[Joe]<i> If Delilah counts
as parental supervision,</i>

250
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,976
<i>- it explains everything.
- </i>It looks hotter on me, though.

251
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
Cool story. Any day now.

252
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,732
[Joe]<i> Note to self: steer clear
of their entire red flag galaxy.</i>

253
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,815
Hey.

254
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,820
You lay a finger on her,

255
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,657
and I will vivisect
your individual scrotums.

256
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,033
She's a kid.

257
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,830
[Joe]<i> In Los Angeles,</i>

258
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,875
<i>grocery stores aren't just a place
you buy carrots,</i>

259
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,878
<i>they're a pristine, non-GMO Disneyland,</i>

260
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>and king among these is Anavrin.</i>

261
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,702
<i>Come for the spring lettuce mix,</i>

262
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,892
<i>stay for the perfect life
that could be yours</i>

263
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>if you spend enough
and quit gluten, you fucking asshole.</i>

264
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,307
<i>And yeah, obviously, Anavrin is...
wait for it...</i>

265
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,559
<i>"nirvana" spelled backwards.</i>

266
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,272
[man] So, no experience at all in sorting
or bagging perishables?

267
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,234
[Joe] Well, I'm a quick study.

268
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,029
It's a coveted job.

269
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,532
Yeah, all the casting directors shop here.

270
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,492
- So...
- Oh, I'm not an actor.

271
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,995
Okay, let me xerox some photo ID

272
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,289
and I'll call you ASAP
and I'll let you know.

273
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,083
Sure thing, ID.

274
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,669
Damn.

275
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,923
- I know... I know I brought it. I just...
- Are you reading that?

276
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,466
Re-reading.

277
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,177
It feels like it gets
more relevant every day, right?

278
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,346
How... so?

279
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,350
Oh, this guy's struggle trying
to get past his mistakes, you know?

280
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,228
I don't like to get political,
but I will say

281
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,814
our world is done for
if we don't think about that.

282
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,441
How to be better.

283
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,485
- I can't believe you just did that.
- Did...?

284
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,030
Made a Russian novel
sound like something I'd <i>want </i>to read.

285
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,452
Uh, I don't mean to spring this on you...

286
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,871
Ever thought about working in a bookstore?

287
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,252
[sighs]
We've been having a time moving product.

288
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,380
You know, I thought
with this whole hacking democracy thing,

289
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,133
people would be like,
"Yeah, I wanna read some Russian stuff.

290
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,576
What's up with that place?" But...

291
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,928
they're intimidated, you know?

292
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,514
Hm, there's nothing to be intimidated by.

293
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,601
It's human experience. It's universal.

294
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,105
[Joe]<i> I think I just felt my soul
come back into my body.</i>

295
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,023
I love it.

296
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,357
You sound like such a...

297
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:56,983
a reader.

298
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,945
Maybe it's 'cause
it's my favorite thing to do.

299
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,405
That...

300
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,489
and...

301
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,992
recommending the perfect book.

302
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,243
Can you start tomorrow?

303
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,372
- [stammering] Yeah.
- Perfect. Let's get you an apron.

304
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,916
[Joe]<i> A new apron?</i>

305
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,416
<i>Joy.</i>

306
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,347
[Joe]<i> Hello...</i>

307
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,599
<i>you.</i>

308
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,851
<i>No, fuck, no, I'm not doing that.</i>

309
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,562
<i>I'm not gonna try to figure out
who you are,</i>

310
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
<i>why you look so concerned</i>

311
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,442
<i>about the state of that heirloom tomato.</i>

312
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,114
- Oh, did I get you? Are you okay?
- It's okay.

313
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,950
[Joe]<i> You have a way with people.</i>

314
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>They just like you.</i>

315
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,331
<i>Your shirt is faded, but fresh.</i>

316
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,251
<i>You like to take care of things.</i>

317
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,546
<i>Your shoes are clean, but more.</i>

318
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>You walk in a town where nobody walks.</i>

319
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>I won't say hello.
I'll accidentally bump into you.</i>

320
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>You'll never even know I was here.</i>

321
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,558
[woman] Excuse me?

322
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,323
Do you think this peach looks like a butt?

323
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
There is no wrong answer.

324
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,692
It looks a little like a butt, yeah.

325
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,109
Right?

326
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,446
Hm. Thank you.

327
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,156
[Joe]<i> Are you flirting?</i>

328
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,784
<i>I'd like to think you are,
but it's just... I can't.</i>

329
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,661
I should also inform you that...

330
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,457
all peaches look like butts.

331
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,917
[Joe]<i> I should walk away.</i>

332
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,252
Oh, yes.

333
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,631
Well, thank you for your honesty.

334
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,342
I might go out on a limb
and suggest that...

335
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,888
bell peppers can be extremely vaginal
depending on how you cut them.

336
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,308
I hadn't noticed that,
but I definitely will now. Thank you.

337
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,726
Yeah, no problem.

338
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,312
Were you following me?

339
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,313
[Joe]<i> Shit.</i>

340
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
Well, I mean...

341
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,525
[Joe]<i> Truth. That is what will
shut this down, truth.</i>

342
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,068
Not initially, but then yes.

343
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,486
I was, completely.

344
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,905
I am sorry...

345
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,656
if I seem skeevy.

346
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,032
No.

347
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,618
I mean, you might've...

348
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,412
if you looked like a skeeve, which...

349
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,540
I guess is me saying, good choice...

350
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,001
showering today.

351
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,961
Good.

352
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,087
I debated, so...

353
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,546
Hm.

354
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299

Yeah. Um...

396

Can you tell me
if this Carl Jung book is vegan?

397
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,071
Uh, if the... if the book is...

398

399

You got me. I just started this week.

- Hey.

Did you tell our new friend Will here

407
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,513
that it was Vegan Author Month
at the cafe?

408
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,182
I will get Will on the right page.

409
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,725

Forty's parents own the place, obviously.

417

Shit. He was being cool just now,

418
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,385

and it's still wrong...

419

You know how some people are,

427

Well, his...

No, I was just trying to figure out
what your movie is.

435

Oh, I think it might be the one where
the woman gets the guy in trouble at work

436

[Joe]<i> I wanted to think you don't know me.</i>

890
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:11,005
<i>You can't, but I'm not too proud
to say when I'm wrong.</i>

891
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,008
<i>And maybe I was wrong about you,</i>

892
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,678
<i>and maybe, even a bit, all of LA.</i>

893
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:22,141
<i>And all I can say is,
I hope I'm also wrong about me.</i>

894
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,435
<i>Maybe I don't need to shut down forever.</i>

895
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,187
<i>Maybe I don't need to run away so fast.</i>

896
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,315
<i>And if that could be...</i>

897
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,733
<i>with you...</i>

898
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,234
Blow.

899
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,235
Ellie.

900
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,487
God, it's from <i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

901
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,821
It's going on your list.

902
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,532
It's two a.m. Does your sister...

903
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
Oh, shut up, Dad.

904
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,952
She's right inside.

905
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,704
I just have insomnia.

906
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,790
From the 14 Frappuccinos.

907
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,667
Okay, sorry. I just wanna make sure...

908
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,961
Okay, Mr. Rogers, good night.

909
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,045
Good night.

910
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,297
Oh, Will,

911
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,342
someone came by looking for you.

912
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,092
Old friend?

913
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,306
Jesse. No, Jasper.

914
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,184
He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back

915
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,644
and that he'll be by.

916
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,729
- [Joe]<i> Fuck.</i>
- Thanks.

917
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,273
Honestly, he seemed a little creepy.

918
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,236
What can I say, friend?
I have creepy taste in friends.

919
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,030
[chuckling] Ew!

920
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,673
[gate slams]

921
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,029
Who is Jasper?

922
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,783
Why is he looking for you...

923
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,367
Will?

924
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,580
How are we gonna take care
of this problem?

925
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,542
[Joe]<i> So here's the thing, Love.</i>

926
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,626
[woman] Cut!

927
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,754
[Joe]<i> It wasn't easy for me to get here,</i>

928
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,964
<i>to buy myself a little time,</i>

929
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,800
<i>this slim chance at a new life.</i>

930
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,552
<i>And then...</i>

931
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,722
<i>I saw you.</i>

932
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,144
<i>And, you know, I really do believe
that things happen for a reason,</i>

933
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,563
<i>that all the hard stuff and the craziness,</i>

934
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,148
<i>and frankly, my own mistakes...</i>

935
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,151
<i>they maybe all led me here...</i>

936
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,236
<i>for a reason.</i>

937
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,071
<i>At least I hope...</i>

938
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,573
<i>that's true.</i>

939
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,868
<i>Because I'm working as hard as I can
to make a fresh start here.</i>

940
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,996
- What the hell were you thinking, Calvin?
- Ray said to stock more fiction.

941
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,349
[Forty] Yeah, he meant fiction
that people actually wanna read.

942
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,213
- [Calvin] Okay, I just figured that...
- What?

943
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,817
There's a human alive
who wants to read <i>Crime and Punishment?</i>

944
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,298
Look, dude, find a way to move these

945
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,759
or, uh... <i>something's </i>moving.

946
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,886
[Joe]<i> It's delicate,</i>

947
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,305
<i>the whole... thing.</i>

948
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,724
[Delilah]<i> I have this vacancy
on the first floor.</i>

949
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,059
[Joe]<i> I like the second floor.</i>

950
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,728
[Joe]<i> 'Cause it's not just a new home.</i>

951
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,981
<i>It's a new me.</i>

952
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,716
[Love]<i> I live right in the neighborhood.</i>

953
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,619
<i>Kismet, right?</i>

954
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,287
<i>I mean, what are the chances?</i>

955
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,248
[Joe]
<i>And when something like that happens,</i>

956
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,331
<i>when it's right,</i>

957
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,753
<i>you start to feel everything aligning,
like fate saying yes.</i>

958
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,005
<i>But again, delicate.</i>

959
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,842
<i>Anyway, this is a bad time,
the worst time,</i>

960
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,468
<i>for a complication.</i>

961
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,514
<i>Maybe I should run right now, Love.</i>

962
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,226
<i>But now I don't want to.</i>

963
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,105
<i>I need to figure out a way
to see this through,</i>

964
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,606
<i>whatever it is...</i>

965
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
<i>with you.</i>

966
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,047
<i>You win, Love.</i>

967
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,924
<i>I'll stay.</i>

968
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,804
[closing music playing]
