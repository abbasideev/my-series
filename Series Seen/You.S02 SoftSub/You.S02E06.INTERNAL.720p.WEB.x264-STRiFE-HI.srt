1
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,688
Who here among us really knew Henderson?

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,234
The famous belong to everyone
and none of us.

3
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,195
Well, I knew him pretty well, I think.

4
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,906
One time, before I was
about to go onstage,

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,827
some dude comes over
and dumps wine all over my front

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,910
on purpose.

7
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,580
[crowd laughs]

8
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,416
Well, Hendy sees this,
and what does he do?

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,055
Number one,
he punches the guy in the face.

10
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,756
Number two, he took off his own shirt

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,090
and gave it to me.

12
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,009
And number three,

13
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,596
he pulled this perfectly clean bra
out of his pocket

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,015
and gave that to me, too.

15
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,810
Oh, by the way, that was
during his comedy prop era, of course.

16
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,854
[chuckles] I think.

17
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,732
The point is,
I don't care where he got the bra...

18
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,610
I heard they found his body
in a sex dungeon.

19
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,987
Come on, Gabe.
Don't kink-shame the dead.

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,423
- [Gabe] No, I'm not, okay?
- [shushes]

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,075
[Mary] But I loved him. You know why?

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,660
He was real. Damn it, Hendy.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,913
A tale told by an idiot...

24
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,125
[Joe]<i> She's still here,
hanging on like a sucker fish.</i>

25
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>Embraced by your friends.</i>

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,719
<i>Everyone's happy you get a break
from your gig</i>

27
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,297
<i>as Forty's primary caregiver,</i>

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>but I will be victorious
in this war she has waged.</i>

29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Stop her permanently.</i>

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,305
<i>Not Henderson permanently,
that got away from me.</i>

31
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>But permanently nonetheless.</i>

32
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,901
I swear to God, if they ever find
the cowardly shit stain who did this,

33
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,737
I'm going to bash his fucking head in.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,032
- Forty.
- I know this is hard,

35
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,284
but you need to find a silver lining,
bunny.

36
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,954
[Joe]<i> Bunny. What an absurd nickname.</i>

37
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,540
<i>I used to find it sweet.
But it's not sweet. It's psychotic.</i>

38
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,750
<i>A bunny boiler is what she is.</i>

39
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,210
He was murdered, babe.

40
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,296
When my ex attacked me,
it was the worst day of my life.

41
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,382
But I didn't lay down and die.

42
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,801
I came out stronger.

43
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,597
That's the thing with tragedy.

44
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,976
It makes you live for the now.

45
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,061
[Joe] <i>Yeah. Live, for now.</i>

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,439
<i>No, no. This can be managed.</i>

47
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,483
Move in with me, Ames.

48
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,487
Ditch the B and B, and be my <i>hausfrau.</i>

49
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,740
[Love] Forty, Forty...

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,452
maybe... maybe it's not the best
to make big decisions

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,705
when you're grieving, you know?

52
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,833
Can you just let me have this? Please.

53
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,458
Like...

54
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,005
I can't be here, okay?
I, like, need some matcha.

55
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,589
Forty.

56
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,890
I think Vampira is buried right over here.

57
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,857
Speaking of which,
I spy the coveted third totem.

58
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,026
[Love, Lucy, Sunrise] What?

59
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,235
- Where?
- What's happening?

60
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,987
- Wham and bam, girls.
- [all gasp]

61
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,281
[Lucy] Oh, my God. I think you're right.

62
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,367
Oh, both wearing the shit
out of that pink lacy dress.

63
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,411
- Oh, my God! You got number three!
- [shrieks]

64
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,913
- Right.
- Yeah!

65
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,289
What's number three?

66
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,333
Oh, right. You're new here. Okay, so...

67
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,169
We have this theory...
well, it's actually Gabe's theory,

68
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,630
which is that Los Angeles
has seven totems,

69
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,108
and once you find all of them,
you're officially an Angeleno.

70
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,634
- And can never leave.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,261
We all found them ages ago,
but Lucy never found the dress one.

72
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,805
- Hey, till today.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,433
- No, this one can count for you, too.
- Oh, great.

74
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,936
[Joe] <i>Stuck in LA forever,
what could be better?</i>

75
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,019
Are you all right?

76
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,957
- You seem...
- [Joe]<i> Like a guy attending the memorial</i>

77
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,983
<i>- of a guy he just killed?</i>
- ...pensive.

78
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,321
- [Joe] <i>I have to keep it light for you.</i>
- It's funerals.

79
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,114
Of course. Um, yeah.

80
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,325
- So, what are these totems?
- [Gabe] Oh, oh!

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,661
- [overlapping]
- Got it, lovely. Thank you.

82
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,329
Uh, number one,

83
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,456
a rollerblader in booty shorts.

84
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,793
Number two, a ghetto bird. Um...

85
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,669
Police helicopter.

86
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:19,008
Number three, two starlets wearing
the same dress, as observed.

87
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,011
- Uh, number four, a pack of coyotes.
- [Lucy] Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,099
Right? Yeah.
Number five, a dog in a stroller.

89
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,434
Number six, an off-brand superhero.

90
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,352
But out of context,

91
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,729
not in front of Grauman's
'cause that's too easy.

92
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,649
Yes, of course. Uh, and number seven,

93
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,859
a palm tree... on fire.

94
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,860
- On fire.
- Yes.

95
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,129
- It's on fire.
- [Love] Right.

96
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,506
- Sounds intense.
- [Gabe laughing]

97
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,530
Yeah, they are.

98
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,660
[Joe] <i>Of course Delilah is here
with a flask.</i>

99
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,997
<i>This must be hard on her. That's my fault.</i>

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,917
<i>But I saved her sister from far worse.
This I know.</i>

101
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,711
Especially in the rain.

102
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:01,050
Hey, um, I gotta pop by work. So, later?

103
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,221
[Joe]<i> A celebrity has died suspiciously.
They'll work harder to solve it.</i>

104
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,223
<i>Did I do enough at the scene?</i>

105
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,351
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Little late to be taking out the trash.

106
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,686
- For Goodwill.
- [Love]<i> Hey.</i>

107
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,272
- Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry.
- [giggling]

108
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm sorry. Of course.

109
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,860
I wolf you.

110
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,903
I wolf you so hard.

111
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,074
[sing-songy] Okay.

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Bye, guys.

113
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,245
- Bye, Lovey.
- Bye, babe.

114
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,208
[Joe] <i>Thanks to Forty, I have new intel.
Candace has an Airbnb.</i>

115
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,086
<i>She needs a place to lower the mask,
to be herself.</i>

116
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,882
<i>I'm going to find it,
and when I do, Hollywood ending.</i>

117
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,093
[opening music playing]

118
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,029
Happy anniversary, Mr. Kennedy.

119
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,366
[woman giggling]

120
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,868
[giggling]

121
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,669
I'm getting around to it.

122
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,672
I know, I know, it's not feminist.

123
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,092
I want to.
I want our kids to have it, too.

124
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,762
Proposition?

125
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,764
It's been a year.

126
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,684
Let's do it, while we're young.

127
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,520
And then when we're in our 40s,

128
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,480
we can drive around
in a big painted van

129
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,731
like the Partridge Family.

130
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,985
Well? Thoughts?

131
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,241
If we know what we want, why wait?

132
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,999
We can have both.

133
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,130
For example, I heard
the new walk-in's not hooked up yet.

134
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,595
[whispering] Anyone could walk in.

135
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,974
Mm-hmm.

136
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,030
[Love sobs]

137
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,725
[Joe] <i>What Candace and I had was
never real. I'm certain of that now.</i>

138
00:07:56,225 --> 00:08:00,146
<i>The way she lies. Effortless.
Like... breathing.</i>

139
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,940
<i>I feel bad for Forty.
He can't resist her Lolita act</i>

140
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,275
<i>any more than I could.</i>

141
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,027
<i>Is she sleeping with him?</i>

142
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,946
<i>Or did she make up some lie
to get out of that, too?</i>

143
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,117
<i>Maybe she's decided it's an acceptable
price to pay to ruin my life.</i>

144
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,869
<i>Or maybe they're in love.</i>

145
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,332
<i>One upside
to Forty's constant online pleas</i>

146
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,878
<i>for validation is it's easy to figure out
where he's gonna be, any given time.</i>

147
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,088
<i>He's on his way now
to play </i>Dungeons & Dragons

148
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,715
<i>at Joe Manganiello's house.</i>

149
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,884
<i>He's been tweeting about it incessantly
for a week.</i>

150
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,512
<i>So what's it gonna be, bunny?</i>

151
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,972
<i>Do we tango here, or...?</i>

152
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>Elsewhere it is.</i>

153
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,317
[Joe] <i>The air feels charged.
Santa Ana winds.</i>

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,403
<i>Anyone with a lick of common sense
would get the hell out of this town</i>

155
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,947
<i>before it's too late.</i>

156
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,200
<i>But not us. We had a date with destiny.</i>

157
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,869
<i>I'm reading too much Chandler.</i>

158
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,498
<i>Where is she going in such a hurry?</i>

159
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,916
<i>Is she meeting someone?</i>

160
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,802
<i>That is a cop.</i>

161
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,430
<i>Probably unrelated,
but I can't be too careful.</i>

162
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:21,936
<i>Shit. Okay, okay. It's possible
I'm the tiniest bit paranoid.</i>

163
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,653
<i>Shit. Candace one, me zero.</i>

164
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,243
- What's up, Ellie?
- Hey.

165
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,497
- What you reading there, Will?
- Oh, uh, Chandler.

166
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,208
[Ellie] Nice one.

167
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,336
You should really watch the film, though.

168
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,589
Robert Mitchum
is my second-favorite Philip Marlowe.

169
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
Okay, who's your first?

170
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,302
Just so I know who to picture when
I'm staring at the boring little words.

171
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,722
Oh, Elliott Gould, of course. Sex on legs.

172
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,558
Probably still can get it.

173
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,881
[Joe] <i>I'm glad to see she's feeling better
after all that happened with Henderson.</i>

174
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,438
[Delilah] Fuck me!

175
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,154
- What happened?
- [Delilah groans]

176
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,282
I grabbed the fucking curling iron,
thought it was the brush. Ow!

177
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,689
- You okay? Run it under cold water. Here.
- Here you go.

178
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,747
[Joe] <i>One thing I know. When a traumatized
woman tries to keep it together</i>

179
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>when she's actually falling apart,
this happens.</i>

180
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,876
Is that better?

181
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,593
- Ellie, can you get me an ice pack?
- Yeah, um...

182
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,183
I saw you at Henderson's memorial.

183
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,684
[Joe] <i>Well, this feels like a trap.</i>

184
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,163
- The woman I'm seeing, her brother...
- Love and Forty Quinn?

185
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,229
Yeah, I know who they are.

186
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,317
Forty used to take up permanent residence
in Hendy's anal cavity

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,320
before he was ejected
for being a junkie prick,

188
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,073
but far be it for me
to question the company you keep.

189
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,744
- I'm gonna go.
- Maybe, yeah. Just...

190
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,288
go and forget all about it,

191
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,708
just like everybody else is gonna do
after they're done canonizing him.

192
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,461
[Joe] <i>She's not wrong. Henderson
may have gotten what he deserved,</i>

193
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,839
<i>but in the eyes of the public,
he's a victim, a hero, even.</i>

194
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,799
<i>That's gotta sting.</i>

195
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,800
[Ellie] I'm sorry, Will.

196
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,427
My sister's a little upset,
and she's also a bitch.

197
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,807
I'm taking all of them down.
Beginning with his succubus of an agent,

198
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,351
followed by anybody else
that turned a blind eye.

199
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,560
They're all complicit.

200
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,022
[Joe]<i> She should see a doctor,
but if I suggest it, she might injure me.</i>

201
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,774
Okay, Jessica Jones,

202
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,110
four ibuprofen and a Xanny.

203
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,488
Take it down a notch, okay?
We'll watch a movie.

204
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,533
[Joe]<i> It sucks that she has to manage
her sister like this.</i>

205
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,452
Uh, Will? Maybe you wanna join?

206
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,289
Tonight we're gonna be streaming
the 1992 classic

207
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,693
<i>- The Player, </i>starring Tim Robbins...
- We have work to do.

208
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,387
You're a good sister.

209
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,599
I know. So, uh... you in?

210
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,186
- Murder, Hollywood?
- [Joe] <i>She needs someone right now,</i>

211
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,147
<i>no matter how cool she's acting.</i>

212
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,649
- <i>Candace can wait until tomorrow.</i>
- You got any popcorn?

213
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,318
'Course I do. I'm not an animal.

214
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,665
[Forty sighs in relief]

215
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,090
Oldest of sports.

216
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,885
Is it bisexual pescatarian week
again already?

217
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,305
- Man, time flies.
- What's D-FOL?

218
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,641
<i>Dark Face of Love.</i> The "the" is silent.

219
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,478
We are setting up a temp production office
in the back.

220
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,605
- Who's we?
- Me and Amy.

221
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,734
And you.
Giving you a producer credit, brohamulus.

222
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,694
Forty, I'm not qualified.

223
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,112
You're hilarious.

224
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,281
It's no pay, just points on the back end,

225
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,576
and as much festival poon
as you can schnorf.

226
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,379
[Joe] <i>He knows
I'm dating his sister, right?</i>

227
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,914
Uh-oh.
Did you not get enough sleep last night?

228
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,208
I was up late.

229
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,876
Okay, well,

230
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,921
still need you to sign
the production contact sheet.

231
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,053
Okay. What's a loan-out?

232
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,307
You can just make something up.
Like, Bettelheim Productions.

233
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,059
Bettelheim Films. Bettel...

234
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,228
That name is really aggressive.

235
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,439
It's not gonna marquee well at all.
We'll brainstorm.

236
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,070
What's Amy's address?
She didn't fill it out. So I can do it.

237
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,199
I know it's in Echo Park.
I wanna say Loma Vista Lane?

238
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,617
I'm not sure what the number is.

239
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,285
[Joe]<i> That's a start.</i>

240
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,621
All right.

241
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,415
First production meeting is 19:00.

242
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,625
All hands on deck.

243
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,836
[Forty chuckles, grunts]

244
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,340
[Joe]<i> Sorry, Fortinbrah,
just made other plans.</i>

245
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,424
Boop!

246
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,719
- Up for a road trip?
- Where to?

247
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,099
Glendora. It is a drive,
but the things that this donut shop does

248
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,422
with fresh strawberries
should be considered a sex crime.

249
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,061
That's intriguing.

250
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,480
Pick me up at six?

251
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,984
[Joe] <i>Okay. Two hours to get
the tactical advantage I need</i>

252
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>to stop Candace. I can make this work.</i>

253
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,950
<i>Only two rentals on Loma Vista Lane,
and one isn't really her speed.</i>

254
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,786
<i>This feels more like Candace.</i>

255
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,913
<i>The Gothic Barbie dream house.</i>

256
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,958

<i>Candace found me, I found her.</i>

263
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,642
[phone buzzing]

264
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,913
[Joe] <i>Toyota Camry. Same as yesterday.</i>

265
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,666
<i>I should listen to my instincts.
This is bad, Love.</i>

266
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,126
<i>Plainclothes cop?</i>

267
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,212
<i>Henderson? Maybe Will talked?</i>

268
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,216
<i>Jasper's associates got to him in Manila...
No, that's crazy.</i>

<i>Dr. Nicky hired a PI from prison.</i>

270
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,972

Oh, no, no no.</i>

271
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,601
<i>This city is fucking endless.</i>

272

<i>If I can't disappear into all that...</i>

00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>No, Love, I don't want to disappear.</i>

274

<i>No, no no. Oh, Love.</i>

- <i>You're having me followed.</i>

00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,688
<i>No. There has to be an explanation.</i>

283
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,588
If you're gonna show up an hour late,
you should call.

[Joe] <i>She's furious,</i>

<i>or the doors are about to fling open

<i>It's hard to say.</i>

287
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,247
I'm so sorry.

288
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,582
Hey, I don't do apology assault, Will.

289
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,795
You stood me up,
you'll get to apologize on my time.

290
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,423
Understood.

291
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,299
[Joe] <i>So far, so weird.</i>

292
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,063
<i>That doesn't look like the face of a woman</i>

293
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,173
<i>who just learned something
unspeakable about her man.</i>

294
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,805
<i>Maybe I should just...</i>

Love...

296
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,185
Is everything okay?

297
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,938
I don't know. You tell me.

298
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,443
When I was walking up just now,
there was a man leaving here.

299
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,988
Yeah, that's Alec Grigoryan.
He's a private detective.

300
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,198
My family's been using him for years.

301
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,325
He was here, why?

302
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,578
Well, I hired him to look into Amy.

303
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,206
- Oh.
- [Joe]<i> You trust me.</i>

304
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,960
<i>It's Candace you don't trust
because you are smart and true.</i>

305
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,129
<i>- But...</i>
- Why wouldn't you say something?

306
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,382
It's not a big deal
unless he finds something, right?

307
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,220
I think hiring a PI
is actually kind of a big deal.

308
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,304
Not if you're a Quinn.

309
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,351
I can't believe you're being so casual.

310
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,937
I don't know why you're freaking out.
You don't even like her.

311
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,120
Would you ever hire someone to follow me?

312
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,942
I don't know. Why? Should I?

313
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,403
[Joe] <i>Who are you right now?</i>

314
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,656
The thing is, people take advantage
of people with money.

315
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,116
It's just a fact, okay?

316
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,619
I'm not gonna apologize
for protecting my family.

317
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,662
Ever.

318
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,539
[Joe] <i>Privilege check, aisle one.</i>

319
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,877
- I just think...
- [sharply] What?

320
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,765
My parents offered to help.

321
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,392
We can pay them back, and...

322
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,033
Can we talk about this?

323
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,874
You're just detoxing.

324
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,302
[Joe] <i>I just think...</i>

325
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,555
I'm some spoiled rich girl?

326
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,643
Independent, but always have
a golden parachute if I need it?

327
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,020
<i>- </i>[Joe] <i>Well, yeah.</i>
- It's not what I meant.

328
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,605
You did.

329
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,612
I'll call Alec tomorrow morning.

330
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,739
Tell him to stop following Amy.

331
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,993
I get how it's too much.

332
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,369
Okay? I'm sorry.

333
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
<i>I'm </i>sorry.

334
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,003
I'm sorry for missing our donut pil...

335
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,795
I told you,

336
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,758
don't apologize.

337
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,639
[giggling]

338
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,729
Salmonella?

339
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,398
- You're an idiot.
- Yes.

340
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,692
[Joe]<i> No secrets, Love. Please.</i>

341
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,153
<i>I really don't do well with secrets.</i>

342
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:03,785
Barry. Okay, Barry,
don't be such a massive pussy.

343
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,245
Just match Ray.

344
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,582
Don't you want your name
on something relevant?

345
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,627
Something that matters,
something... Exactly.

346
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,673
Yes... Of course I'll tell my dad.

347
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,967
Thank you, Barry. Thank you.

348
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,636
[kisses] Thank you.

349
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,599
Barry's in the bag.
Put him down for 100K.

350
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,810
Great. I have a hair thing.

351
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,063
Oh, okay.

352
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,025
Bye. Treasure you.

353
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,820
Fucking Barry.

354
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,895
Can I help you?

355
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,356
I'm looking for Will.

356
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,692
Oh, sorry. He's not home right now.

357
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,194
I'm Amy. You are...?

358
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,988
The building manager.

359
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,198
Oh, cool.

360
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,828
I love these old Deco places.

361
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,249
I'm glad Will opted for some charm
and not some soulless condo.

362
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,835
- How do you know Will?
- Friends.

363
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,170
But, you know, it's complicated.

364
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,924
You were at the memorial yesterday,
weren't you?

365
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,553
Yeah. Hence, complicated. [chuckles]

366
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,596
Will and I used to date.

367
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,642
He has a pair of earrings
I've been <i>trying</i> to get back.

368
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,894
- Do you think you could...
- Did you know Henderson?

369
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,187
Forty did.

370
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,108
His comedy really wasn't my speed.

371
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:02,904
And I don't mean to speak ill of the dead,
but he seemed kind of like a perv.

372
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,996
Oh, you can't actually come in.
It's against the law.

373
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,707
Um, but what do they look like?

374
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,917
Like, dangly little green stones.

375
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,878
Do you have any idea where they might be?

376
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,171
Um...

377
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,546
Nightstand?

378
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,300
Okay, I'll go... I'll go look.

379
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,181
[Delilah] So, are you from Brooklyn, too?

380
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,225
Not originally,
but that's where I met Will.

381
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,063
That's cute. Who followed who?

382
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,983
I'm sorry?

383
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,778
To LA. Did you follow him or him you?

384
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,613
Oh. We were already broken up

385
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,282
so more of a coincidence
that we both ended up here.

386
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,119
Well, I didn't find any earrings.

387
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,204
Um...

388
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,747
[sighs] Damn it.

389
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,292
All right. I'll hit him up later.
Thank you so much.

390
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,460
Yeah, no problem.

391
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,762
[phone ringing]

392
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,181
<i>- </i>[Love] <i>This is Love.</i>
- Miss Quinn.

393
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,351
- Alec Grigoryan.
<i>- Yeah, thanks for calling me back.</i>

394
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,520
I've decided
I want to call off the investigation.

395
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,043
You can charge me for the whole day.

396
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,148
<i>Well, I think you're gonna wanna see
what I found.</i>

397
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,817
Can you meet?

398
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,970
[Joe]<i> Now that you've called off the dogs,</i>

399
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,628
<i>I can get back to the work
of getting Candace away from us.</i>

400
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,590
- Hey, Casanova.
- I'm gonna keep walking, Ellie.

401
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,135
I'm just impressed.

402
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,680
Our little Will caught the eye
of heiress Love Quinn

403
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,182
and is sneaking around
with a secret ex-girl.

404
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,476
Did not think you had that much game.

405
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,019
Ex-girl?

406
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,439
I appreciate how you're not racist
towards gingers.

407
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,358
Ginger? What are you talking about?

408
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,611
Came by looking for earrings. Come on.

409
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,240
- That's, like, gotta be code for...
- [Joe] <i>Candace, here.</i>

410
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,535
Listen to me. That woman, she's...

411
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,703
She's what?

412
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,456
- What?
- She's no one.

413
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,417
- You are so lying to me right now.
- Go home.

414
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,297
Hey, just because you're dripping
in hoo-ha doesn't mean you're all that!

415
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,381
Asshole.

416
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,598
<i>Candace coming here crosses a line.
I need a new plan.</i>

417
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,565
<i>If you think about it,
she's already living on borrowed time.</i>

418
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,526
<i>She resurrected
like some sort of ginger vampire</i>

419
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,986
<i>to suck my life away.</i>

420
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,406
<i>Dealing with her is nothing
but balancing the cosmic scales.</i>

421
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,203
<i>It's not safe, her walking around free.</i>

422
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>She's dangerous, not just to me.
To your brother. To you.</i>

423
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,929
<i>Night off. That works.</i>

424
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>Seems bunny's home.</i>

425
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,648
[dog barking in the distance]

426
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,221
[woman grunts]

427
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,560
[groans]

428
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:09,109
[Joe] <i>"Rope bondage." "Tight binding."
"Krav Maga"?</i>

429
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Candace!

430
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,789
Untie me, you... bitch!

431
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,457
- [woman] I'm sorry,
- Oh!

432
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,334
<i>- what</i> did you call me?
- Ah!

433
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,961
[Joe]<i> Not Candace. What?</i>

434
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,390
[Candace panting] Hi.

435
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,184
I... I just... I... [clears throat]

436
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,686
Just save your lies for the cops.

437
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,606
No, this is...
this is not what it looks like.

438
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,732
Oh, really?

439
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,568
Candace Stone?

440
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,157
You're not a film financier.
You're a waitress, barely.

441
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,910
Spent a good few weeks
in a mental hospital last year.

442
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,415
You have no money, no family,
no permanent address.

443
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,084
And so you tried to con us.

444
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,421
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- Love, okay, please...

445
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,215
The one thing I still don't understand
is what you want with Will.

446
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,594
His name's not Will.

447
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,556
- Jesus Christ, what...
- It's Joe Goldberg.

448
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,226
He's my ex-boyfriend.

449
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,688
I know this sounds crazy,
but I am telling you the truth.

450
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,856
[Love sighs]

451
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,983
He attacked me and almost killed me.

452
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,278
- He what?
- Yes. And he killed the girl after me.

453
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,823
Is this some kind of joke?

454
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,825
I... I wish it was.

455
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,912
I only came here to protect you.

456
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,874
Before you went to Austin
to date my brother or after?

457
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,751
No, to protect all of you.

458
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,712
But especially you.

459
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,507
If he loves you,

460
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,636
that's the most dangerous thing.

461
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,229
Take a look inside.

462
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,779
[woman] Now, bitch, what's your name?

463
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,030
Will.

464
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,492
Why did you break into my home, Will?

465
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,575
I didn't break in.

466
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,162
- I was just...
- Don't lie to me.

467
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,789
I learnt Krav Maga.

468
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,667
And I'm not afraid to use it.

469
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,129
[Joe] <i>I’ve made mistakes, but, oh my,
is this a new first prize?</i>

470
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,296
The door was open.

471
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,216
Is an open door the same
as an invitation to enter?

472
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,094
[stuttering] I'm sorry.

473
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,805
- I asked you a question.
- Please.

474
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,765
Come on, Will. Consent 101.

475
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,436
Is an open door the same
as an invitation to enter?

476
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,563
No, no. No, it's not.

477
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,940
[Joe] <i>Who knows
how to tie people up like this?</i>

478
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,985
<i>This woman is clearly
some kind of perverted sex worker.</i>

479
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,945
<i>Not that I'm judging.</i>

480
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,780
<i>- Think.</i>
- [woman] Think.

481
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,864
Who's Candace?

482
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,995
Amy... Adam. That's why I'm here.

483
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,078
I see.

484
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,791
And you were going to...

485
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,002
That's... that's...

486
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,837
That's not what it looks like.

487
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,506
I was supposed to creep in
and surprise her.

488
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,678
In bed. She wanted me to tie her up.

489
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,806
- And, you know, it... This is...
- You're telling me

490
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,017
this is some kind of scene you negotiated?

491
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,894
We're both really vanilla, I admit.

492
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,938
But she keeps asking,
and I wanna be more GGG.

493
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,940
This is not the first time
she has flaked on me.

494
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,987
This is the first time I have been beaten
and tied up for it, though.

495
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,409
Jesus. You poor, pathetic boy.
You went to Home Depot.

496
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,495
Can I give you a piece of advice?

497
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,539
Um, maybe untie me first?

498
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,958
Don't try so hard. This isn't you.

499
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,544
You're not rape fantasy guy.

500
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,172
I'm not.
[stuttering] Not even a little bit.

501
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,901
You're demeaning yourself, man.
Let me tell you something about Amy.

502
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,805
She's hardly been here
since she rented my room.

503
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,304
- I can hardly feel my hands.
- I know the type.

504
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,473
Come to LA with stars in their eyes,

505
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,892
but few, if any,
have the talent to make it.

506
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,644
So they starfuck.

507
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:18,191
You know, she's dating some douche-canoe
with a <i>stupid</i> name.

508
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,777
Forbes? Francis?

509
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,779
[scoffs] Idiot.

510
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,239
Mm-hmm.

511
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,660
A lot of men in LA should just be taken
out of the gene pool.

512
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,496
[Joe] <i>Murdered by an unhinged dominatrix.</i>

513
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,871
<i>Remember me, Love.</i>

514
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,707
I'm inclined to untie you.

515
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,710
But you try anything stupid,

516
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,963
and I throat punch you
with my Louboutin, dig?

517
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:40,880
Yes.

518
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,132
Yes, I dig. I dig.

519
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,010
[Joe grunts]

520
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,847
[groaning]

521
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,474
Ah.

522
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,271
Call yourself a Lyft, sweetie,
and get the fuck out of my house.

523
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,192
[Joe] <i>Candace two, me zero. Damn it.</i>

524
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,373
It smells amazing.

525
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,041
It's a new recipe.

526
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,419
Taste?

527
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,743
[coughing] That... It tastes...

528
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,826
Like shit?

529
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,583
- [gags] I'm sorry. It's... it's salty.
- Yeah.

530
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,543
It's 'cause I used salt instead of sugar.

531
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,629
Sucks being lied to, huh?

532
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,385
What is this?

533
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,304
Open it.

534
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,649
[Joe] <i>Truth time.</i>

535
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,360
Tell me it isn't you.

536
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,944
It's me.

537
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,324
Is your name Will Bettelheim?

538
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,493
My name is Joe.

539
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,497
Joe Goldberg.

540
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,589
- And Amy...
- Is Candace Stone. I know. I...

541
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,009
Why did she tell me
that you buried her alive?

542
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,054
- That's what she believes.
- Yeah, well, she also believes...

543
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,225
that you killed a woman,
and that you're basically Dexter.

544
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,810
Candace Stone is crazy.

545
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,018
Clearly!

546
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,273
But there also must be some grain of truth
because you look so pale right now.

547
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,316
So just tell me.

548
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,402
I can find out.

549
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,990
Anything. Right?

550
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,452
Unlimited resources.

551
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,959
Okay. Can...

552
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,506
Candace is the reason I left New York.

553
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,466
She's obsessed with me.

554
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,554
She destroyed friendships, relationships.

555
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,932
- I had to leave my job.
- Okay.

556
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,767
Say you're right. She's nuts.

557
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,312
What about the other girl?

558
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:49,318
Guinevere Beck.
<i>The Dark Face of Love</i> herself.

559
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,864
Yeah, that was tragic.

560
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,783
But we went out on one date.

561
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,452
My main takeaway

562
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,748
is she posted a photo of us
to make her actual boyfriend jealous.

563
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,292
I never saw her,

564
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,055
until months later
I heard she passed away.

565
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,297
You tell me how Candace knows
about that at all.

566
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,966
Why do you think I had no social media?

567
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,908
Why do you think I changed my name?

568
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,554
I wanted to disappear,
and she followed me.

569
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,308
[sighs] I just wanted to be free.

570
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,728
And then I met you.

571
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,067
Love, I am so sorry I lied.

572
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,693
Why didn’t you tell me...

573
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,322
the moment that she showed up with Forty?

574
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,744
I was terrified.

575
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,537
Well, I sent her away.

576
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,624
With a few threats, a lot of money.

577
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,169
So she’s gone for real.

578
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,963
But <i>fuck,</i> Will.

579
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,008
Joe?

580
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,971
[shuddering] I don't even know
what I'm supposed to call you now.

581
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,807
Call me whatever you want.

582
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,227
Call me Will. You can call me Joe.

583
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,687
You can call me that fucking liar.

584
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,397
Call me in the middle of the night.

585
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,318
Call me happy, sad, sick,

586
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,278
for favors,

587
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,740
for sex, for a laugh,

588
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,326
a cry...

589
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,540
Don’t ever stop calling me.

590
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,377
I have never loved anyone
like this before.

591
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,007
[voice cracking] Me neither.

592
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,479
Which is what makes this so hard.

593
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,272
[sniffles]

594
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,533
It's over.

595
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,164
[door opens and closes]

596
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,686
How long have you um...

597
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,231
How long have you known?

598
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,447
You’ve been keeping this from me
for two <i>months?</i>

599
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,326
You lied.

600
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,121
Why?

601
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,336
How am I...?

602
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,553
[sniffles, shuddering]

603
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,088
You can't. You can't. You can't.

604
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,259
You can't be sick.

605
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,072
[Joe]<i> It would be easy
to blame Candace for this,</i>

606
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:06,242
<i>and I do, but I blame myself too.</i>

607
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,202
<i>I broke my own rule.</i>

608
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,746
<i>But what is life without Love?</i>

609
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,252
<i>I guess I'm gonna find out.</i>

610
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:20,006
Well, if it isn’t Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Douchebag.

611
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,512
I came by to drop off my badge
and my apron.

612
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,140
You don’t have to quit.

613
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,600
I do, Forty.

614
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,520
Actually... you don't.

615
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,231
Look, Love told me everything,

616
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,235
and while we agreed
that you are a lying ball sack,

617
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,070
we also agreed

618
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,740
that you probably don’t need
to be punished twice.

619
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:51,120
So just, like, stay out of her airspace
for a while. Okay?

620
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,456
Are you saying I should stay?

621
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,207
For now.

622
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,295
I went to bat for you.

623
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,172
Why?

624
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,301
Because it's nice having you around.

625
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,135
You’re real.

626
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,724
You did lie about your identity,

627
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,977
but you are still more authentic

628
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,104
than half the fuckers I know.

629
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,607
Thanks, man.

630
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,443
[Joe]<i> If being Forty’s bitch
means I get to stay in your orbit,</i>

631
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,986
<i>sign me up.</i>

632
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,946
<i>Like I said, he’s not a bad guy.</i>

633
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,116
You’re not one
of those self-loathing Jews, are you?

634
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,701
- [Joe]<i> Spoke too soon.</i>
- What?

635
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,994
Joe Goldberg.

636
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,080
Great name for a producer.

637
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,164
Will Bettelheim...

638
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,876
made you sound like a Nazi, so...

639
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,171
Thank you for giving me another chance.

640
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,131
And thank Love for me, too.

641
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,908
Land of second chances, am I right?

642
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,056
[Joe]<i> This can work.</i>

643
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,934
<i>I’ll just go back to loving you
from a distance.</i>

644
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,773
<i>Life’s a divine comedy.
A tale told by an idiot.</i>

645
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,567
- [whimpers]
<i>- A sadistic idiot.</i>

646
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,069
<i>Speaking of sadists,</i>

647
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,946
<i>I’d endure a ten-hour session with Rachel</i>

648
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,365
<i>for just five more minutes
of you not hating me.</i>

649
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,118
- [door slams]
- Please do something.

650
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,126
[Joe knocks] Hey, Delilah?

651
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,002
What?

652
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,963
[Joe]<i> It’s worse than I thought.</i>

653
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,048
[Joe sighs]

654
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,550
How’s it going?

655
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,971
Hmm. How's it going? Um...

656
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,849
This town enables rapists.

657
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,227
You mind if I take a look?

658
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,904
Wow. This is quite a who’s who.

659
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,363
Oh!

660
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,991
Oh, look, I made the cut.

661
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,993
Don’t touch, please. Don't touch.

662
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,620
[Joe] <i>I’d be worried,
but half of Hollywood is up there,</i>

663
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,955
<i>including Johnny Carson,</i>

664
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,832
<i>who I’m pretty sure has been dead
for years.</i>

665
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,210
This is a lot, Delilah.

666
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,131
[scoffs] You don't think I know that?

667
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,384
I’m trying to topple the patriarchy

668
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,802
from my two-bedroom apartment,

669
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,639
and it is, one, impossible,
and, two, deranged,

670
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,851
and I just...
I just want somebody to hurt...

671
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,187
like I'm hurting.

672
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,400
Is... Is this okay?

673
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:31,906
Oh, look at you, asking for consent,
very fucking woke. Gold star.

674
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,576
I’m sorry he hurt you.

675
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,002
[Joe]<i> Palo santo and synthetic watermelon.</i>

676
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:49,340
<i>Odd combo, but it works.
Wise and irreverent, like her.</i>

677
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,884
Will...

678
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,517
[Joe]<i> She’s not in her right mind,
and neither am I.</i>

679
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,643
<i>This is bad.</i>

680
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,186
<i>So why doesn’t it feel bad?</i>

681
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,147
Okay, wait. [stuttering] You're upset.
Maybe we shouldn’t...

682
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,150
I just want to feel good again.

683
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,110
[Joe]<i> Me too.</i>

684
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,080
[Joe]<i> She needed someone.</i>

685
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,083
<i>I suppose it's the least I could do.</i>

686
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,253
This whole thing that you're doing...

687
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,462
Is a lot.

688
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:33,092
And I have ten unpleasant phone calls
I need to get to, so...

689
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,803
- Maybe you should just go.
- Yeah, okay...

690
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,763
So, I have a thought aboutthat.

691
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,472
Oh?

692
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,684
Chasing this story...

693
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,564
You know the story already.
It's... it's your story.

694
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,234
- Are you saying...?
- I'm saying...

695
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,654
you go after the whole town
if you want,

696
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:58,742
but what if you tell your story?
Think about how powerful that would be.

697
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,497
It might encourage others to do the same.
You wouldn’t have to chase them down.

698
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,792
They would follow your example
and come forward.

699
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:14,258
Did you just mansplain
<i>and </i>patronize me in the same sentence?

700
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,428
Thanks for the D, Will. Bye.

701
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,891
[indistinct chatter]

702
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,064
[Joe] <i>I gotta get out of this town, Love.</i>

703
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,988
[man] Can you believe this?

704
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,324
[camera shutters snapping]

705
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,242
[Love]<i> Seven totems.</i>

706
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,078
And once you find all of them,
you are officially an Angeleno.

707
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,623
...and can never leave.

708
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,251
[Joe]<i> Starlets in matching dresses.
Dog in a stroller.</i>

709
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,463
<i>Off-brand superhero.
Rollerblader in booty-shorts. Cop chopper.</i>

710
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,547
<i>Pack of coyotes.</i>

711
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,217
<i>And the burning palm tree.</i>

712
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,887
<i>As Raymond Chandler said,</i>

713
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,183
<i>"There is no trap so deadly
as the trap you set for yourself."</i>

714
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,811
<i>Maybe I’ll stick around for a while,
push my luck.</i>

715
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,605
<i>One thing’s for sure,</i>

716
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,774
<i>you can’t beat the donuts.</i>

717
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,546
