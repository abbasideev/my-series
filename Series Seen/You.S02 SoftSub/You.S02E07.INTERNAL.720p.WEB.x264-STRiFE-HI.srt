1
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,279
[Joe]<i> It's weird,</i>

2
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>the things you do
when you're broken up with.</i>

3
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,951
<i>I considered stepping
in front of a car the other day</i>

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,786
<i>just so you'd look at me.</i>

5
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>I know, I should run.</i>

6
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,251
<i>Candace could storm in
with a SWAT team at any moment,</i>

7
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>and, honestly, it would be a convenience.</i>

8
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>Everything hurts,
and nothing is okay without you, Love.</i>

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>You... don't make it easy to check in.</i>

10
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,272
<i>I'm shut out, and you want me to know it.</i>

11
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>I just want to know you're okay, Love.</i>

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>And, maybe, to know you're hurting too.</i>

13
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,783
<i>Goddamn curtains.</i>

14
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,284
[stammering]<i> I...</i>

15
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>What the...?</i>

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>Who the fuck is that?</i>

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,341
[Joe]<i> There are a lot of seedy characters
in this town, Love.</i>

18
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>It's a good thing you moved
your spare key to... to the bird house!</i>

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,557
Shit. Shit.

20
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,190
[phone ringing]

21
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,610
[Joe]<i> If I go over there,
you'll know I was watching.</i>

22
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,862
<i>If I don't... Oh, damn it.</i>

23
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,420
[Love moaning]

24
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,799
[Joe]<i> I get it now.</i>

25
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>The curtains aren't to shut me out.</i>

26
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,555
<i>They're a kindness
because you've already moved on.</i>

27
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,724
[opening music playing]

28
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,027
[Love] Okay.

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,197
[Joe]<i> Not so long ago,</i>

30
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,576
<i>that was me,
with your fingers in my mouth.</i>

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>Me, eating your delicious cooking.</i>

32
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,998
<i>Me, tasting the food in your mouth</i>

33
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,126
<i>when you couldn't wait
till after you'd swallowed to kiss </i>me.

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,796
<i>Didn't think you were one for pretty boys.</i>

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>Could you really be
into all those muscles?</i>

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,718
<i>Who is this monster?</i>

37
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,886
[Forty] That...

38
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,471
is Milo.

39
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,307
[sighs]

40
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,267
It's not really my business.

41
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:09,230
- [Joe]<i> Milo. Milo what?</i>
- Milo fucking Warrington.

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,735
You know,
he used to be James's best friend.

43
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,030
Love's late husband James?

44
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,155
Exactly.

45
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,701
He just spent two years traversing Asia

46
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,246
so he could sprinkle James's ashes
all over the Himalayas.

47
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,540
And now he's back,

48
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,294
traversing Love's vagina. Again.

49
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,504
'Cause he does that periodically.

50
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,798
- [Joe]<i> So he's a...</i>
- Scumbag.

51
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,509
I would <i>Poltergeist</i> the shit out of him
if I was James.

52
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,386
[Joe]<i> I need answers, Love.</i>

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,930
Well, maybe it's a comfort thing.

54
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,474
I mean, they've both been
through something terrible.

55
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,141
[Forty] Yeah.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,228
Maybe for her, it is.

57
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,939
But he's been sweet on her since college.

58
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,274
He could not stand it
when she chose James.

59
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,069
And then guess who was Mr. Attentive
at the funeral?

60
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,572
Yeah. He stayed for weeks after.

61
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,950
Cooked, cleaned, bathed her,

62
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,410
went down on her every night.

63
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,205
Nobody does that shit out
of the kindness of their own heart, Joe.

64
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,665
He was preying on her

65
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,291
when she was vulnerable.

66
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,335
And now he's doing it again.

67
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,088
Picking up the pieces
when your body's barely cold.

68
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,800
[Joe]<i> He's a predator,
and you're falling for it, Love.</i>

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,719
Don't worry, sport,
she's not falling for it.

70
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,223
Love will give herself permission to do
what she needs to do to heal,

71
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,934
but she is still very broken up over you.

72
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,019
She does not look very broken up.

73
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,522
Challenge accepted.

74
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,774
Watch this.

75
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,656
[Joe]<i> Milo Warrington,</i>

76
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,201
<i>Australian Zen Buddhist travel blogger</i>

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,954
<i>with a penchant for holding baby animals
with his shirt off.</i>

78
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,539
<i>Sponsored by Patagonia,</i>

79
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,833
<i>which is easier
when your dad owns Patagonia.</i>

80
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,669
<i>He free-climbs, plays guitar,
trains horses,</i>

81
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,963
<i>volunteers in third-world countries?</i>

82
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:01,009
<i>No, he's too perfect. No guy like this
actually exists outside a romance novel.</i>

83
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>I smell a fraud.</i>

84
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,389
<i>And you look too enchanted, Love.</i>

85
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,853
What's up?

86
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,815
Really? Bringing Mr. Didgeridon't
around just for Joe to see?

87
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,192
It's all a little Dottie of you.

88
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,111
You cannot possibly be into him.

89
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,239
Okay, first of all, never compare me
to Mom again.

90
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,284
And secondly, I'm actually into him.

91
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,619
No, this is good for me.

92
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,331
And I don't need you coming in
on behalf of Will,

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,250
or... Joe,
or whatever the fuck his name is,

94
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,836
trying to make me feel
some type of way about it, okay?

95
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,006
Milo is good. At least he's honest.

96
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,299
Is he, though?

97
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,883
[Love chuckles]

98
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,678
Do me a favor.
Focus on your own shit, okay?

99
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,723
Move to the light, as Dottie would say.

100
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,353
[Forty sighs]

101
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,565
- Hey, Forty.
- Hi, Salami Nips.

102
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,780
[Forty sighs]

103
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,283
As I suspected, she is not over you.

104
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,827
- Did she say that?
- She did not need to.

105
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,871
This is what Love does when she's hurting.

106
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,415
She, like, gets a little basic

107
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,251
and pretends to like things
that she definitely does not like

108
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,711
in order to seem normal.

109
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,173
And also, it's the only time
that she'll snap at me. It's a tell.

110
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,508
[Joe]<i> Makes sense.</i>

111
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,719
<i>When I was getting over Beck,
I glommed onto Karen Minty.</i>

112
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,429
<i>Good, but wrong for me.</i>

113
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,140
<i>Is that who Milo is? Is he your Karen?</i>

114
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,018
Okay, so you know
what you have to do now, right?

115
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,605
Get back on the horse,
start dating around,

116
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,192
show Love how free
and happy you're living.

117
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,568
She will hate that.

118
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,362
I'm not the vindictive type.

119
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,615
And she's not really the jealous type.

120
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,701
Oh! I'm sorry,
did the two of you share a womb?

121
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,956
Yeah, trust me, okay? She gets jealous.

122
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,332
Now let's set you up.

123
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,795
Forty.

124
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,383
Why are you helping me?
I lied to your sister.

125
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,466
I lied to you.

126
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,013
I tangled you up in this...
this Amy-Candace mess.

127
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,350
Hey. As Shakespeare once said,

128
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,145
"Bitcheth was crazy."

129
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,564
You lied out of necessity. Okay?

130
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,650
That guy is a pie-hunting snake

131
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,236
in Tarzan's body,
and I do not trust him.

132
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,321
My gut says you're good,

133
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,740
he's bad, case dismissed.

134
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,955
[Joe]<i> I'm starting to see what you see
in Forty. He is smart.</i>

135
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,916
<i>And he loves you hard. I get that.</i>

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,669
All right. I need something good
for your Flingr profile.

137
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,504
Spit me some literature, please.

138
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,922
Flingr?

139
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,217
You are not putting this poor,
innocent man on there.

140
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,635
I suggest Magnolia.

141
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,304
It's mostly queer,

142
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,264
but straight girls troll
for gays to beard,

143
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,099
- and they are aggressive as fuck.
- Oh.

144
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,894
I know it's a deeper conversation,
but I'm just saying,

145
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,314
- I could have all the pussy I could...
- Eat.

146
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,775
Eat... or whatever.
So, by all means, you take it.

147
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,694
Goldleaf is another good one.

148
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,297
It's only for celebrities,
so we would need to get you verified,

149
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,866
but, uh, it's safer for people like us.

150
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,534
[Calvin] You up on the lingo?

151
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,369
"PnP," whatnot?

152
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,874
"Party and play," a.k.a. drugs and sex?

153
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,919
Oh! If someone hits you
with a "What's up," capital T,

154
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,754
that means "Tina," which means meth.

155
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,423
- Why is Tina meth?
- Oh, and you definitely need to watch

156
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,787
for kitten-fishing thirst traps.

157
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,052
- What?
- Pictures.

158
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,221
Like, if it's a close-up head shot,
she's fat.

159
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,640
If it's a group shot, she's, like,
really insecure,

160
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,184
but, like, wants to seem fun.
And if she has a pixie cut...

161
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,435
[both laugh]

162
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,979
- Oh, and...
- Okay.

163
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,650
Thank you both. Wow.
That's a lot to think about.

164
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,150
And I will.

165
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,905
Thoughts?

166
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,740
Chum in the water.

167
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:02,333
[Joe]<i> You know, I gotta hand it to this
guy, he takes a gorgeous picture.</i>

168
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,793
<i>Not that it's difficult</i>

169
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,420
<i>when the subject is you.</i>

170
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,258
[stammers]<i> Uh, what was that?
No. Did I just like his photo of you?</i>

171
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,634
<i>- Son of a...</i>
- Hey, creep.

172
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,761
- Hey.
- Do me a favor.

173
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,098
Instead of Delilah,
fuck anything else. Cool?

174
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,392
How... Why do you know about that?

175
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,810
Just be a normal person

176
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,396
and rebound on Flingr
instead of your literal neighbor.

177
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,023
- Can you do that?
- [Delilah] Elle?

178
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,195
Can you scrounge up some more quarters?
We need three more.

179
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,279
Fine.

180
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,284
But if I come back
and witness anything nasty,

181
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,578
I'm running away forever.

182
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,704
[Delilah scoffs]

183
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,126
- Hi.
- Apartment three.

184
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,547
- Delilah, I'm sorry, I...
- Stop, it's no big deal. Okay?

185
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,424
You can stop avoiding me

186
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,801
and pay your fucking rent
because it's late.

187
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,637
- That's right. I'm sorry.
- And stop apologizing.

188
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,848
Okay.

189
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,727
But, hey, Flingr is a great idea

190
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,148
because you clearly need some training
on how to be a single human man in LA.

191
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,443
Noted.

192
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,281

193

00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,077
<i>Maybe I do.</i>

195
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,291
Bye, creep.

196

Why do <i>you</i> hate Will?

198
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,967
I mean, he's grumpy, and I give him shit
'cause I kinda hate him,

199
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,386
- but, I don't...
- I don't <i>hate</i> him.

200
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:42,141
Ever think maybe it's because I like him,
I don't want things to blow up?

201
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,684
Which you know will happen.

202
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,146
Then he'll have to move,
or we'll have to move, and it just...

203
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,650
Can't things just be simple for once?

204
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,485
Fair enough.

205

I don't want you to make that decision
because of me.

298

328
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,594

00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,360
That's crazy. I just saw, um, Milo.
He, you know, he's...

335
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,280
It's a coincidence. I guess he's hiking.
Everybody's hiking today.

- Uh...

Will, I have
an especially potent bullshit detector.

these forced niceties?

- Stop the little white lies.

above anything else.

343
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,969
And she caught you in a fucking whopper.

344
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
I know.

345
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,724
- I know...
- That being said,

346
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
in almost ten years of our friendship,

347
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,025
I don't think she has ever talked
about someone

348
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,730
the way that she has talked about you.

349
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,273
Not even James.

350
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,109
So I think there's still hope.

351
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,195
But this whole Flingr-whore,
jealous stalker thing,

352
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,947
it is not a good look.

353
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,950
You wanna know
why Love is so attracted to Milo?

354
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,910
- [Joe]<i> Yes.</i>
- He worked on himself.

355
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,622
Damage attracts damage.
Healthy people like healthy people.

356
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,208
- What if I'm damaged?
- Honey...

357
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,754
everybody came here because they are.

358
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,841
The point is what you do with it.

359
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:58,512
Maybe it's time you faced this
like a true Angeleno, hmm?

360
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,932
[Joe]<i> Terrified to know what this means.</i>

361
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,100
Come along.

362
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,895
[meditation music playing]

363
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,572
How are you feeling?

364
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,906
[Joe]<i> Crazy.</i>

365
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,116
Nervous.

366
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,701
What are you afraid of?

367
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,246
[Joe]<i> That one of these will graze a
nerve, and I'll become Sloth from </i>Goonies.

368
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,497
Um...

369
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,832
I don't know.

370
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,294
Ow.

371
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,879
What are you afraid of?

372
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,970
I don't know, I'm afraid this won't work.

373
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,015
That is what you thought I wanted to hear.

374
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,101
What are you afraid of?

375
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,103
[Joe]<i> Okay. Breathe.</i>

376
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,149
<i>Think. Answer honestly
because your psycho friend Gabe</i>

377
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,859
<i>is a human lie detector.</i>

378
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm afraid...

379
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,571
this will work.

380
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,655
And?

381
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,742
I'll say something... true.

382
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,661
Something bad.

383
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,373
You'll tell Love.

384
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,003
And I'll lose her forever.

385
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,964
[Joe]<i> What is in these needles?</i>

386
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,383
The truth does not scare Love.

387
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,844
This would.

388
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,846
[Joe]<i> Love, your friend is a sorcerer.</i>

389
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,932
So, you believe your truth...

390
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,310
makes you unworthy of love?

391
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,729
[Joe]<i> I need to stop talking now.</i>

392
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,897
Yes.

393
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,775
And, therefore, unworthy of Love.

394
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,281
[voice crumbling] Yes.

395
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,076
[sobbing quietly]

396
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,536
- [Joe as a child]<i> Mommy?</i>
- [Joe's mom]<i> Joe.</i>

397
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,788
<i>Baby.</i>

398
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>- Get in here.</i>
- [Joe]<i> I was afraid you left.</i>

399
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,669
[Joe's mom]<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

400
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,294
What's happening?

401
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,005
[Joe as a child]<i> My home is you.</i>

402
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,275
[Gabe] Who would you be
if you didn't have anyone to love?

403
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,260
[Joe's mom]<i> Joey, you're such a good boy.</i>

404
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,928
What did you lose...

405
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,140
that makes you chase love so much?

406
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,980
Today's the day.

407
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,898
We're getting out of here.

408
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,275
Where are we going?

409
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,567
I don't know yet.

410
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,822
But we're never gonna see him again. Okay?

411
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,741
I'm sorry I did this to you.

412
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,581
I thought he'd be better this time,

413
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,250
but he was worse.

414
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,960
We're done.

415
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,087
We're out.

416
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,755
- What are we?
- Out.

417
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,091
That's right. Pack your stuff.

418
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,261
Take only the important things,
none of those books.

419
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,762
You hear me?

420
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,265
Okay, you can take one.

421
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm gonna go to the bank,
and I'll be back at four to get you.

422
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,775
And it'll be just the two of us.

423
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,072
As long as we're together,

424
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,366
we'll always be home.

425
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,421
[Joe crying out loud]

426
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:26,053
You have been in the pursuit of someone
to love and care for for all of your life.

427
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,262
What if...

428
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,139
- [Joe sobs]
- you were that person?

429
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,558
[Joe coughs]

430
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,560
What if you're all that you need?

431
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,103
Say it with me, "I...

432
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,688
- I...
- ...am all I need."

433
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,856
...am all I need.

434
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,191
Again.

435
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,486
I am all I need.

436
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,711
How are you feeling?

437
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,129
Free.

438
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,552
Full.

439
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,349
- [laughing]
- It's the power of self-love.

440
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,685
As Mama Ru says,

441
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,814
"If you cannot love yourself,

442
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,359
how in the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?"

443
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,985
Hm.

444
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,032
Okay, easy.

445
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,912
Easy now. You're gonna feel
a little out-of-body for a while.

446
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
All right?

447
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,501
You're a wizard.

448
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,545
Thank you.

449
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,841
But this is not a cure-all.

450
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,509
It's a practice.

451
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,847
You're still gonna experience
dark thoughts and emotions.

452
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,975
What is important
is that you follow it up with,

453
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,269
"And I'm okay with that."

454
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,480
"I'm okay with that."

455
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,192
Good. [claps] Good, good.

456
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,529
It's also important
you keep that temple clean, okay?

457
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,073
I'm gonna suggest
a quick seven-day cleanse.

458
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,912
[juice machine running]

459
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,791
Eew!

460
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:25,338
Dude, I love green juice,
but celery is basically Satan's butt plug.

461
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,631
It's not that bad.

462
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,009
Oh, I can't look at you
while you drink that.

463
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,012
But we do need to chat, re: D-FOL.

464
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,182
We gotta find a big name to play Beck.
Or maybe...

465
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,269
we take the auditions on the road.
Like, look for our Scarlett O'Hara.

466
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,896
Do you have any thoughts?

467
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,441
[Joe]<i> It's kind of nice how Forty
sabotages his own process so much.</i>

468
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,026
<i>It takes it out of my hands entirely.</i>

469
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,695
- Shouldn't we write a script first?
- [scoffs]

470
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,946
[Ellie] What you writing?

471
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,742
Ellie, what are you doing here?

472
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,536
Checking in to see
how the dating world's treating you.

473
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,704
Being neighborly.

474
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,206
[Joe]<i> I don't buy it.</i>

475
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,875
Celery juice?

476
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,544
Ugh, what is wrong with you?

477
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,254
This kid knows what's up.

478
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,091
He's on a juice cleanse,
trying to fix himself, win back my sister.

479
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,843
Flingr was a bust, huh?

480
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,180
The kid is Ellie Alves, by the way.

481
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,975
Read in the trades you acquired
a pretty big piece of IP, Forty Quinn.

482
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,059
Trades?

483
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,270
Yeah,
I had my agent put out a press release.

484
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,189
[Joe]<i> Shit. Fuck. Damn it, Forty.</i>

485
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,526
If you need any help with development,
I'm really good with coverage and notes.

486
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,695
[Joe]<i> And there's the real reason
she's here. Little opportunist.</i>

487
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,822
- What are you, 12?
- I'm almost 16,

488
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,158
and I can guarantee you
I know more about film

489
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,285
than any idiot assistant
to come out of WME.

490
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,538
- [Joe]<i> Oh, here we go.</i>
- All right, Hermione,

491
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,621
who was originally supposed to play
the Terminator?

492
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,126
OJ Simpson, but James Cameron thought
he looked too nice to play a killer.

493
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,627
What's the longest narrative film shoot
in history?

494
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,297
<i>- Boyhood, </i>12 years.
- Not even close.

495
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,775
<i>The Thief and the Cobbler, </i>29 years.

496
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,093
- Doesn't count. It's not live-action.
- Not what I asked.

497
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,678
Okay.

498
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,597
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

499
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,101
What say you, sport?
Should we hire ourselves an intern?

500
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,728
[Joe]<i> Well, Forty's no Henderson.</i>

501
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,273
<i>And Little Miss Ballsy
is bound to find opportunity elsewhere.</i>

502
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,858
<i>Probably with less honorable people.</i>

503
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,360
<i>The devil you know, right?</i>

504
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,443
Fine.

505
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,611
After homework,

506
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,740
limited hours,
only with Delilah's written permission.

507
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,410
- [grunts]
- Okay, Dad.

508
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,968
[Joe]<i> Beautiful and artful,
though a bit of a violation.</i>

509
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,304
<i>Because I know
you would've never consented to this.</i>

510
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,055
<i>Uh, not my business.</i>

511
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,409
<i>If you want to be with someone
who posts intimate pictures</i>

512
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,103
<i>without your knowledge for millions
to enjoy, it's your choice, Love.</i>

513
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,688
<i>And I'm okay with that.</i>

514
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,771
[knocking on door]

515
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,442
[knocking on door]

516
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,820
- Hey.
- Hey.

517
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:59,034
So, remember how you mansplained to me
that I should write my Henderson story?

518
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,243
Vividly.

519
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,995
[Joe]<i> Am I sweating? Why am I sweating?</i>

520
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,622
Well, I'm not saying I did it,

521
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,000
but if I had written it and submitted it,

522
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,795
I might have gotten confirmation
that it's gonna be published

523
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,964
in <i>Variety </i>fucking magazine.

524
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,550
Holy shit, Delilah! That's so great.

525
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,053
Let's be clear, though,
this is not a thank-you.

526
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,097
I will never thank you. Clear?

527
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,141
- So...
- [Joe]<i> What is happening here?</i>

528
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,225
Yeah. So clear.

529
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,478
What is happening here? Are you...

530
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,146
- [retches]
- [gasps]

531
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,564
[shrieks]

532
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,566
[thuds]

533
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,983
Oh, my God.

534
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,656
[both chuckle]

535
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,491
Oh, my God. That is so good.

536
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,618
Mmm.

537
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,164
It's Meyer lemon and plum curd
and Italian buttercream.

538
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,832
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

539
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,668
My favorite so far.

540
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,471
[scoffs] You've said that
about all of them.

541
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,630
And I meant it every time.

542
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,008
Sunrise and Lucy will be stoked
with any of these, babe.

543
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,133
[sighs]

544
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,302
You're...

545
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,970
incredible.

546
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,889
Thanks.

547
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,393
But if you call me "babe" again,
I'm gonna stick you in the oven.

548
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,144
[both chuckle]

549
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,859
So...

550
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,780
I found a place.

551
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,157
Little bungalow in Atwater.

552
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:25,120
Close enough I can jog to you,
but not so close it's clingy.

553
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,080
- What about...
- I canceled Bali.

554
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,209
You said if it felt right for me to stay,
then I should.

555
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,795
And... this feels right.

556
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,662
I want to see where this goes.

557
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,424
Milo, I care about you a lot.

558
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,634
And this has been great.

559
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,093
I just...

560
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,972
I like the way things are.

561
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm not sure
I'm ready to change the dynamic.

562
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,188
The dynamic where you call me
when you need to get over another guy?

563
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,692
Yes. But it's not just that.

564
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,448
You, more than anyone,
know that I am a package deal.

565
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,284
Forty...

566
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,119
he needs me.

567
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,929
He's working on this film, which,
quite frankly, is bound to fail

568
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,956
because they all do.

569
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,000
And when he does, he'll implode.

570
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,126
I can <i>feel</i> it.

571
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,688
It's just like the earthquake.
We all know the big one is coming.

572
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,506
- He's a grown man, Love.
<i>- </i>But he's not, really.

573
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,219
One thing I love is your honesty.

574
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,931
Maybe it's time to get honest
with how codependent you are with him.

575
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,434
Hey, look.

576
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,978
[Milo sighs]

577
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,273
I'm... falling in love with you.

578
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,735
And it's okay if you're not there yet.

579
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,403
I can wait.

580
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,572
Just... let me.

581
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,283
Please.

582
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,211
[Delilah] Will? Will, wake up.

583
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,295
Oh!

584
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,589
[groaning]

585
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,006
What happened?

586
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,636
You <i>Exorcist-</i>vomited
all over my favorite top

587
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,262
and then passed out.

588
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,932
[sighs] Oh.

589
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,028
Same thing happened to me
a couple years ago

590
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,521
when I read that celery
was negative calories.

591
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,341
I ate nothing else for three days

592
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,025
and then projectile barfed
all over my own birthday cake.

593
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,446
- Oh.
- Enough of this juice shit.

594
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,616
I'm ordering burgers and shakes.

595
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,749
So?

596
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,216
Ugh. [exhales]

597
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,634
It's hard to read.

598
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,053
But I still couldn't put it down.

599
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,096
[snaps tongue]

600
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,598
It's incredible.

601
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,227
Well, don't sound so <i>surprised.</i>

602
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,481
It's weird
how powerful vulnerability can feel.

603
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,698
I don't think I would've had the guts
if you hadn't angered me into it.

604
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,653
Still not a thank-you.

605
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,182
You know you can always count on me
to say the wrong thing.

606
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,073
[Delilah chuckles]

607
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,660
If I told you I was proud,
would you want to hurt me?

608
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,412
- Probably.
- Okay.

609
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,621
- Yeah.
- Well.

610
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,332
I'm definitely not proud of you.

611
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,753
So... did you really think you
were gonna juice your way

612
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,589
back into Love Quinn's heart?

613
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,381
Wasn't about her.

614
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,718
Not really.

615
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,761
What? You trying to reach
your goal weight?

616
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,805
Just want to clear the noise.

617
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,890
Did it work?

618
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,309
I don't know.

619
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,937
Maybe I'm cynical, but I...

620
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:43,651
really don't think any of that stuff works
for anyone who's truly broken.

621
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,908
Serves us better
to just keep barreling forward

622
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,530
and hope the demons can't keep up.

623
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,324
So...

624
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,409
might as well be who you are.

625
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,537
This is not outrunning demons.

626
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,206
This is slaying them.

627
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,709
- No thanks to you.
- Zero thanks to me.

628
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,792
[Delilah giggles]

629
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,671
[Joe]<i> Nice to meet the real you, Delilah.</i>

630
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,131
<i>You're really quite beautiful.</i>

631
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,214
<i>Oh, no.</i>

632
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,426
This is good.

633
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,138
Everything's better with a little whiskey.

634
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,307
In fact,

635
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,976
this night could do
with a little bit more.

636
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
You up for a walk?

637
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,400
My first impression of you was...

638
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,527
weirdo.

639
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,364
Oh, come on, you can't be surprised.

640
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,200
- [chuckling] You had no social media.
- [groans] Oh!

641
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,787
You show up with a backpack, all New York.

642
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,415
Most people show up
like overeager labradoodles.

643
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,292
I couldn't pull shit out of you.

644
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:46,089
Almost like you were purposely trying
to have no personality whatsoever.

645
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,925
- [both laugh]
- [Joe groans] Ow!

646
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,176
<i>In vino veritas.</i>

647
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,636
Hey, you asked for it.

648
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,014
Okay, my turn.

649
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,976
What was your first impression of me?

650
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,395
Be honest.

651
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,038
- [Joe]<i> Definitely do not be honest.</i>
- I thought you seemed nice.

652
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,774
[Delilah laughs]

653
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,318
Okay, you're such a liar.

654
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,781
Why don't you wash your mouth out,
try again. Veritas.

655
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,828
[Joe]<i> Oh, well, here goes.</i>

656
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,539
I thought you seemed sad.

657
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,377
I could see how much you had
on your shoulders.

658
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,254
It's a lot.

659
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,049
Also, I have this bad habit
of trying to fix people.

660
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,845
Thus, the unfriendly New Yorker.
So I'm sorry about that.

661
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,928
Hey...

662
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,640
Stop apologizing.

663
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,143
[Joe exhales]

664
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,354
You still think I'm a weirdo?

665
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,484
I mean, I always trust first impressions.

666
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,279
Thing is,

667
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,239
I like weirdos.

668
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,703
Damaged finds damaged.

669
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,914
Every time.

670
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,551
[both panting and grunting]

671
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,304
[siren chirps]

672
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,188
[Joe]<i> Fuck me.</i>

673
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,606
[gate closes]

674
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,364
David Fincher.

675
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,658
Come on. He's a personal friend.

676
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,285
Can we just get him in here,

677
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,121
so we don't have to do
the whole phone call thing?

678
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,373
No? Okay.

679
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,542
[groans]

680
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,146
[Joe]<i> What if they take fingerprints?
What if they take DNA?</i>

681
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,924
<i>Not like there's a crusty jar of piss
in Peach Salinger's house or anything.</i>

682
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,927
Guard's playing deaf and dumb.
It was worth a try, though.

683
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,054
What a night, huh?

684
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,264
How long do you think they'll keep us
in here?

685
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,892
I don't know.
I think it's like a six-hour hold.

686
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,735
And then they take our fingerprints
and shit.

687
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,104
[Joe]<i> Shit, shit, shit.</i>

688
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,524
Are you okay?

689
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,110
- I just...
- [Joe]<i> Benji, Peach, Beck, Jasper, Hendy.</i>

690
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,736
...don't like confined spaces.

691
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,154
Okay. Well, don't worry.

692
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,781
I got this.

693
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,158
Is this really your first time
being arrested?

694
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,743
- Is it not yours?
- [chuckles]

695
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,246
- [door opens]
- [cop] Delilah.

696
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,790
Fincher, thank God!

697
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,208
[Joe]<i> Really?</i>

698
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,770
Can you get us out of here?
It was just a big misunderstanding.

699
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,754
We were barely tipsy.
We weren't even driving...

700
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,798
I heard why they brought you in.

701
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,881
That doesn't sound

702
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,592
- like a misunderstanding to me.
- Finch.

703
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,805
You need a lawyer.

704
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,516
I'm sorry, but, uh...

705
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,642
I can't help you.

706
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,811
[Delilah sighs]

707
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,896
[door slams]

708
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,987
Will, you know anybody with pull
who isn't a jealous fuck?

709
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,031
[Forty laughing]

710
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,951
It's no problem, sport.
I have a guy for these things.

711
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,579
Just sit tight. Oh, and, hey...

712
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,789
I'm so proud of you.

713
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,124
[laughing]

714
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,333
[phone beeps]

715
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,962
Oh, my God. In an alley.

716
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,340
Bettelheim. Alves.
You're next for processing.

717
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,842
Fab.

718
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,427
[Joe]<i> Mexico's only a few hours away.</i>

719
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,096
<i>I could start there.
Will did say I'd like it. Then go south.</i>

720
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,306
<i>Keep going.</i>

721
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,185
There you go.

722
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,228
All right, let's go, D.

723
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,108
You and your friend are free to go.

724
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,865
Apparently,
you have some pretty powerful friends,

725
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,158
William Bettelheim.

726
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,619
Thank you, Officer.

727
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,371
Wait, I know you.

728
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,372
Yeah, he's my neighbor.

729
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,291
You've probably seen him
around the building.

730
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,210
Thanks for your help.

731
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,890
Is that it?

732
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,517
If not, I know where to find you.

733
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,068
Well, the sun's already up.

734
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,194
It's beautiful.

735
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,990
I actually have to get to work,

736
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,326
but thank you

737
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,704
for a night I will not soon forget.

738
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,081
[Delilah chuckles]

739
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, that was fun.

740
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,421
Should probs stick to friendship
from now on, though.

741
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,091
For Ellie.

742
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,884
Friends?

743
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,431
You're such an idiot.

744
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,556
[Joe chuckles]

745
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,733
[Ellie] Are you guys fucking kidding me?

746
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,526
Elle, I...

747
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,570
You left me alone all night
so you could get laid?

748
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,657
Why do you have to be such a slut?

749
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
[sighs]

750
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,080
Friends.

751
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,715
[Forty] Indecent exposure.

752
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,968
It's a really good title for something.
It kind of rolls off the tongue.

753
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,178
Indecent exposure.

754
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,422
I'm not telling you anything.

755
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,016
How lewd... conduct.

756
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,977
Hey, gents.

757
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,689
Salami.

758
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,150
[Joe]<i> You don't like surprises.
And you hate roses.</i>

759
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,195
She hates roses.

760
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,905
It's like he's not even trying,

761
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,283
and yet, somehow he still tries too hard.

762
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,163
[sighs]

763
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,123
- Later, fellas.
- Bye, Vagemite.

764
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,750
Oh, hey,

765
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,336
really looking forward
to your next failed attempt

766
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,837
to lock down my sister.

767
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,672
I'm loving the enthusiasm.

768
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,131
[Joe]<i> Don't do it.</i>

769
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,216
Forty...

770
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,813
I know it's not easy for you
when Love's attention's on someone else.

771
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,350
But I'm gonna be around,
so it'd be nice if we could be cordial

772
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,768
like adults.

773
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,394
Your sister and I are happy.

774
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,105
And it'd nice if you could be happy
for her, too. Huh, champ?

775
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,358
[Joe]<i> Shit.</i>

776
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,987
Interesting. See, the way that I see it,

777
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,532
you're not gonna be around long, at all.

778
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,910
'Cause you're a Neanderthal.

779
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,912
Wow, when are you gonna grow up?

780
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,707
When are you gonna realize that
natural deodorant is not working for you?

781
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,792
Guys, let’s take it down.

782
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,793
What’s going on?

783
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,479
You're the reason why Love
can’t do anything good with her life.

784
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,296
You’re a fucking albatross
around her neck.

785
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,964
- Milo...
- [Forty] I wonder what James,

786
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,425
your best friend, is thinking,
sitting up in heaven,

787
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,387
watching you fingerbang his wife
'cause you can’t keep your dick hard.

788
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,388
- [thud]
- Hey!

789
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,847
Oh, my God. Forty.

790
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,931
That’s enough.

791
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,225
Get the fuck out, Milo!

792
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,226
He started it!

793
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,560
- Oh, grow up!
- Me?

794
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,479
I’ve been biting my tongue
for a long time.

795
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,882
But maybe if you paid less attention
to your idiot brother,

796
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,667
and more attention to what’s actually
in front of you,

797
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,571
you might've noticed sooner
that James was sick.

798
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,323
She said get out.

799
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,492
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

800
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,577
Be a big man?

801
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,995
Hope she takes you back?

802
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,926
[phone buzzing]

803
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,933
[groans]

804
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,561
What?

805
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,771
<i>I remembered
where I knew your friend from.</i>

806
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,982
Great. Bye.

807
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,026
<i>Stopped him for jaywalking,
right outside your place.</i>

808
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,450
Pulled some limited-edition headphones
off him.

809
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,865
Really? You were that cop?

810
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,450
<i>He was throwing them away, D.</i>

811
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,785
William Bettelheim
drives a beater Honda Civic

812
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,538
and makes $12 an hour working
at a grocery store.

813
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,207
<i>Those headphones alone cost
more than he makes in a week.</i>

814
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,294
You ran a background check, Finch?
What the hell is wrong with you?

815
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,464
<i>Listen, Delilah, that was the same night
that Henderson was murdered.</i>

816
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,383
What’s a guy with no real money,
no assets doing,

817
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,760
getting rid of $600 headphones

818
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,221
at 4:00 a.m.
the same night a celebrity was killed?

819
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,473
<i>The same celebrity</i>

820
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,808
<i>who is the spokesperson
for those fucking headphones?</i>

821
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,519
Okay, just stop, Alex Jones.

822
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,980
Look, I know you didn’t like seeing me
with another dude,

823
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,399
<i>but this look is not cute.</i>

824
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,775
If you wanna be exclusive,

825
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,278
you can ask me out on a real date,
and then we’ll talk.

826
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,339
<i>But I’m not entertaining your ego anymore.
Goodbye.</i>

827
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,448
No, D.

828
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,533
[sighs]

829
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,089
Doesn’t mean anything.

830
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,053
[Delilah]<i> My skirt was pulled up.</i>

831
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,347
So you’re saying Henderson...

832
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,630
- Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.
- How much did you pay Will to follow me?

833
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,394
Just wanted to make sure you got
that envelope on your doorstep.

834
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,606
- How did you know about that?
- This is quite a who's who.

835
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,667
- Oh, look, I made the cut.
<i>- </i>[Fincher] <i>Apparently,</i>

836
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,652
you have some pretty powerful friends,

837
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,986
<i>William Bettelheim.</i>

838
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,791
There’s no way.

839
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,672
You see? Nothing.

840
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,437
[exhales heavily]

841
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,025
All right.

842
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,032
- [muffled chatter]
- [door closes]

843
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,132
Hey.

844
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:59,011
That was the most disgusting display
of toxic masculinity.

845
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,014
Okay, I don't need you, or you,
or anybody to defend me,

846
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,224
or my honor, or whatever you think
makes you entitled

847
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,018
- to do what you just did.
- Okay.

848
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,814
Miss "Sic the PI on my Girlfriend
for My Protection,"

849
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,860
retract the claws,
lest you scratch yourself with hypocrisy.

850
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,072
[laughs]

851
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,700
Yeah. We’re all a bunch of assholes.

852
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,288
Yeah, you’re right. It wasn’t our place.

853
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,499
I’m sorry.

854
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,168
[Forty] I'm sorry too.

855
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,547
We just...
We love you too much. Don’t we, sport?

856
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,841
[Joe]<i> Always.</i>

857
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,680
I should get going. I have dinner plans.

858
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,515
Another date?

859
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,476
It's just dinner with a friend.

860
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,897
Hey.

861
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,859
You’re a good friend...

862
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,153
Joe.

863
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,407
[Joe]<i> My name.</i>

864
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,785
<i>My real name in your mouth is like poetry.</i>

865
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,161
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

866
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,163
<i>no matter how much self-work I do,</i>

867
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,375
<i>a part of me will always miss the home
that is you.</i>

868
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,460
<i>And I’m okay with that, Love.</i>

869
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,171
[gate screeching]

870
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:29,601
What in the actual... fuck?

871
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,361
[camera shutter snapping]

872
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,992
[shutter continues snapping]

873
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,503
Holy shit, perv!

874
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,422
[shuddering breaths]

875
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,216
- Ew.
- [shutter snaps]

876
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
Oh.

877
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,603
[shuddering breaths]

878
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,854
[phone ringing]

879
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,400
Hey, Finch, it’s me. Uh...

880
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,320
[stammering] Just call me back.

881
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,661
- [gate rumbling]
- [Delilah gasps]

882
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,171
I got a nanny cam

883
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:44,218
in my apartment
when my crazy ex... broke in.

884
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,555
I was gonna ask
if you wanted to have dinner tonight.

885
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,018
Until I saw you’d already been by.

886
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,979
And found some keys.

887
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,272
[phone buzzing]

888
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,149
Give me the phone.

889
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,902
Don’t make me take it.

890
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,620
[Delilah breathing heavily]

891
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,875
What are you gonna do?

892
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,174
I will <i>scream.</i>

893
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,884
It's soundproof.

894
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,429
[sobbing] Just think about Ellie.

895
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,267
She will be alone.

896
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,827
[mother] Hey, booger.

897
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,289
This is Dale.

898
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,332
Say hi.

899
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,545
Come on. Get in the car.

900
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,089
Your dad will be home any minute.

901
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,551
[Joe] You said it would just be us.

902
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,013
How exactly did you think
that was gonna happen?

903
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,225
Come on. I don’t have time for this.
Get in, Joey.

904
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,483
Get in the car.

905
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,583
No.

906
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,254
Oh, no, no, no.

907
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,049
[shouting] No, no, no!

908
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,259
[Joe] Don't panic.

909
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,053
I'm not gonna hurt you.

910
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,639
I would never do anything
to hurt you or Ellie.

911
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:57,601
Will, please, do not leave me in here!

912
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,979
I just need to make some arrangements,
and you will never see me again.

913
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,190
I promise you and Ellie will be fine.

914
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,901
Together.

915
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,279
I just need you to trust me.

916
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,367
Can you trust me, Delilah?

917
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,668
[closing music playing]
