1
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:32,761
Shit.

2
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:34,761
Ooh, John, it's getting late.

3
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,361
I need to get my kip.

4
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,761
I do hope you're not playing for time.

5
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,281
Oh, I, er...

6
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:50,041
I'd leave Alastair to sleep for a while.

7
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,961
The poor thing's quite exhausted.

8
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:55,921
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

9
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:57,921
Cheeky.

10
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,841
Good night, chaps.

11
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,321
Alice.

12
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,281
What have you done?

13
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,921
Guess.

14
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,441
- Why?
- Why do you think?

15
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,921
We were out from under it.
We were clear.

16
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,161
And now?

17
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,241
Come with me.

18
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,241
I don't think
I'm going to do that, John.

19
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:00,601
No.

20
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,081
Oh... Come here!

21
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:11,921
Oh, God, you...

22
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,001
So you like it like this?

23
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,401
You just have to say... Oh, ow!

24
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:22,961
Oh!

25
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:35,241
# Love is like a sin, my love

26
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:42,081
# For the ones
that feel it the most

27
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:49,241
# Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

28
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:54,001
# She will love you like a fly

29
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:58,321
# Will never love you again #

30
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,841
Shush, now.

31
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,921
Still awake?

32
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:18,841
Barely.

33
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,001
I'm too tired.

34
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:25,841
Come on.

35
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,401
Listen.

36
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,081
Look,

37
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,721
I know what you went through yesterday.

38
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,441
And I know it was my fault.

39
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,481
Won't happen again.

40
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,841
I worry about you, that's all.

41
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:55,601
I want you to be safe.

42
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,481
I am.

43
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,441
I just get carried away.

44
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,041
It's like, er...

45
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,241
Do you remember
the hitchhiker in Australia?

46
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,441
Little Miss Birkenstock.

47
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:27,881
That was something we did together,
according to the rules, far from home,

48
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,881
on holiday.

49
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,801
We did it spontaneously,

50
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:33,481
spur of the moment.

51
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:36,361
-Yeah, but we discussed it.
-Briefly.

52
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,761
But it was still within the parameters
of our agreement, Jeremy.

53
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,601
If that still means anything to you...

54
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:46,721
Of course, it does.

55
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,761
Because the balance of risk has shifted.

56
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,081
You're being too reckless.

57
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,721
I need you to understand that.

58
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,161
To really understand it.

59
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:09,161
The risk to me, to my life,
to my career,

60
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,321
my liberty.

61
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,361
I do.

62
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,281
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,041
I love you.

64
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,521
I love you, too.

65
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,401
Are we there yet, John?

66
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,601
Are we there yet, John?

67
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,521
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

68
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,961
Oh, you have to be kidding.

69
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,721
So I take it I'm being arrested.

70
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:46,841
Because you do remember how many crimes
we've committed together?

71
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,681
Is that a threat?

72
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,561
Absolutely.

73
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,321
Okay.

74
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:57,921
I'll be watching you.

75
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,361
Just be here when I get back.

76
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,001
Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,561
My wig is making my scalp itch.

78
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:08,201
Would you please remove it for me?

79
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,041
Please?

80
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,681
Stay there.

81
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,361
Looks like your mate's come through,
old sausage.

82
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:00,201
All right,
meet me at Milton Arches

83
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:01,961
in 45.

84
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:05,521
Once she's in my care, I'll make a call.

85
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,281
Your old pal here is free to go.

86
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,601
Alice, whatever you're doing
in there, stop it.

87
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,001
It itches.

88
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,161
No, listen.

89
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:18,521
Stay still and wait.

90
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:53,761
Yes, okay.

91
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,081
Address is...

92
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,961
Freedom.

93
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:38,721
Shit!

94
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:10,761
Hold still.

95
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,881
Yeah.

96
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,041
Come on.

97
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,161
Come on.

98
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:09,681
Hop in, John.

99
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:14,641
-So who's Person X?
-What?

100
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,481
I'm tired, what does that mean?

101
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:19,841
Well, I was handcuffed in the back seat
with an itchy wig and nothing to do

102
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:21,161
except chew things over,

103
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:23,681
and it occurred to me
that George Cornelius

104
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,721
must know you well enough
to be acquainted with your weaknesses.

105
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,721
-Which are what?
-Other people.

106
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,441
So if I were him, what would I do?

107
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,201
I'd say, "Bring me Alice Morgan,

108
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,921
"or I will do something absolutely
dastardly to Person X."

109
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,241
Am I warm?

110
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:40,601
-Toasty.
-Mmm.

111
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,721
And you actually considered doing it,
didn't you?

112
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,361
-Yeah.
-Giving me to him.

113
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,441
Oh, yeah.

114
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,281
But you couldn't go through with it.

115
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,041
-No.
-Why not?

116
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:54,241
You know why not.

117
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,761
Then say it.

118
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,441
Fine, then. Super.

119
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:05,001
Where are we going now?

120
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:10,881
Darling?

121
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:13,961
Darling.

122
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,521
Darling, are you awake?

123
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,121
I don't know how else to say it.

124
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,721
We have guns.

125
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:29,921
It's not gonna happen.

126
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,641
You do know they won't be so generous?

127
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,121
They'll kill you as soon
as they look at you.

128
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,761
And you are very nice.

129
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,121
Alice, I don't care who gets hurt.

130
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:44,601
All right? Knock yourself out,
break legs, but no one dies.

131
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,281
I really don't see
why it matters.

132
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,321
-I know you don't, but it still does.
-Fine.

133
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:05,681
Where's the key? Ha!

134
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,361
Come on.

135
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:14,961
Please.

136
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,921
Emergency.

137
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,201
What service do you require?

138
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,601
Oh, good evening.

139
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,561
A concerned citizen
has absolutely insisted

140
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,481
that I let you know about a fire

141
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,081
at the Lock N' Roller storage
on the Wolcott Road.

142
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:54,561
Cheerio.

143
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,761
Come on, my pretty.

144
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:08,481
Come here, my pretty.

145
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,081
That's it. One.

146
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:13,761
Two.

147
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:27,961
Move!

148
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:02,881
Drop it.

149
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,081
Drop it!

150
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,001
Benny comes with me.

151
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:26,841
What?

152
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:29,841
Fucking what?

153
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,361
What are you doing?

154
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,161
Minding my own business.

155
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,641
Oh, dear God above.

156
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:58,921
- Halliday?
- Morning, boss!

157
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,601
-I've been trying to get a hold of you.
-I bet you have.

158
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,681
-Excuse me?
-Mmm-hmm.

159
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:02,761
- Do you mind?
- Sorry?

160
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,961
No, not you. Sorry, listen,
I've had a bear of a morning.

161
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,041
Erm, I've been thinking,

162
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,881
whose head was Jeremy Lake looking at
on the MRI scan? It feels wrong.

163
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:09,961
Great minds! I'm on my way

164
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,641
- to find out now.
- How?

165
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,001
It's not enough for a warrant.

166
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,641
Er, no worries, erm,
I don't need one.

167
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,401
Well, don't do anything stupid.

168
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:18,841
Well, no promises,

169
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:21,601
but I was actually aiming
for the opposite of stupid, so...

170
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,121
All right, you let me know.

171
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,241
Oh, will you keep your phone on?

172
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,041
Yeah, no,
I'll call back as soon as I can.

173
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,161
Now, listen, can you
cover for me?

174
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:29,601
Okay, bye.

175
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:32,761
Oh, my God, she's chirpy.
Must be insufferable.

176
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,601
We need to lay low until this is sorted.

177
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:39,481
Where we can go that's safe?

178
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,041
Nowhere where Cornelius
can be watching us,

179
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,761
which rules out your place or my place.

180
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,401
And Alice's.

181
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,841
Jeremy Lake's office.

182
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,881
Hello, can I speak
with Dr Lake, please?

183
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,161
I'm afraid Mr Lake's
not yet in the office.

184
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,601
I'm sorry, could you just hold the line
for a moment?

185
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,161
Hi. Sorry, sorry.

186
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,641
I think I left my glasses
in here yesterday.

187
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,441
They're roundish and tortoise shell.

188
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,001
Well, Mr Lake would usually
give them to me. He didn't say anything.

189
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,081
Oh, right.

190
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:36,521
It's just that I'm pretty sure
I had them when I went in there.

191
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:38,441
Do you think I could just have
quick squizz around

192
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:40,121
and I won't break anything.

193
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,761
Fine. Please try not to.

194
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,201
Thank you.

195
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,121
- Hello, Mr Lake's office.
- Dr Lake, please?

196
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:16,721
It's a matter of urgency.

197
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,401
Okay.

198
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,801
Would you mind calling back?

199
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:44,321
- Ah!
- How'd you get on?

200
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:45,921
I can't find them.

201
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,561
Such a shame. Thank you.

202
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:19,881
Okay.

203
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,801
So you brought the devil
around for breakfast.

204
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:26,441
Mark, I need a favour.

205
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,281
Who did you say these belong to?

206
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,841
It belongs
to a person of interest.

207
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,921
Which doesn't quite
answer the question, does it?

208
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,201
It doesn't really, does it?

209
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:41,721
What did you think of the cake?

210
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:46,841
Well, whoever it belongs to is very ill.

211
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,041
-How ill?
-Look.

212
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,041
I'd need to confirm it, of course,
but this here...

213
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:54,361
-Uh-huh?
-...looks to me

214
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:56,081
like a frontal lobe tumour.

215
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:57,761
Okay.

216
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,281
And what are the symptoms of that?

217
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:11,681
Hello, I'm Jeremy.

218
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,361
What are you going to do to me?

219
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,601
What do you think?

220
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:33,121
Why?

221
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,481
Because I like it.

222
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,361
It's basically all I've ever thought
about since I was about yea big.

223
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:43,321
Jeremy.

224
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,841
Oh, that's terribly good.

225
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:49,361
I just dangle my name
and you swim along and snatch it up.

226
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:51,841
I expect you're trying
to humanise yourself.

227
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,481
You'll be telling me
about your husband next.

228
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,201
Your mum and dad,
maybe the babies you want to have.

229
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:01,361
I've got money.
I can get you money.

230
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,641
No, you can't.

231
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:05,881
I don't need money.

232
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,001
What I need right now
is to head off to work.

233
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,481
And all day,
as I'm slicing into people...

234
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,761
No, don't. Please, don't.

235
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:15,881
- I'll be thinking about...
- Don't say that.

236
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,401
I'll be thinking about
what I want you to do for me.

237
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:21,521
Do you want to know what that is?

238
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:26,681
-Hmm?
-No.

239
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:34,161
I don't know. Don't do this, please.

240
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,881
There's a phenomenon
known as Stockholm syndrome.

241
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,481
I expect you've heard of it in a meme
or something.

242
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:43,121
So in the spirit of scientific inquiry,

243
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:47,201
I'm going to keep you down here
until you fall in love with me.

244
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:49,001
Er, what?

245
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,601
I know it sounds difficult

246
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:53,681
to believe at first blush,
but it will happen.

247
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,201
And in the end...

248
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,881
What? No.

249
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:00,521
When you've learned

250
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,121
not only to love me, but to adore me,

251
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:06,161
when you've cast aside all desire
ever to leave me,

252
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,921
that's when you get to leave.

253
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:12,361
When you no longer want to.

254
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,921
Right, off to work.

255
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:22,721
Oh, and one more thing.

256
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:24,921
My wife is very jealous.

257
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:26,721
Very possessive.

258
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:29,641
If she finds out
I've got, well, a mistress down here,

259
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,161
she'll strangle you
with your own ovaries.

260
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:33,521
So, quiet as a mouse, eh?

261
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,481
Errol, it's Benny.

262
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,441
Look, I know you're probably sleeping,

263
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,241
but I need you to lay low
till I get home.

264
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:54,361
Okay?

265
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,561
Make yourself at home.

266
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:08,881
Oh, you're very nice.

267
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,961
Er, do you have any bacon?

268
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:14,001
I've been a vegetarian
since I was 17.

269
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,201
Of course you have.

270
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:21,521
So the last I heard you were...

271
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:27,241
Well, quite,
but apparently only the good die young.

272
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:28,721
Well, then, congratulations.

273
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:30,961
You can expect to live forever.

274
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,721
Well, I'm certainly
gonna give it a whirl.

275
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,401
Mark, I'm really sorry
to do this to you.

276
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:41,841
My wife's at work.

277
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:43,761
You need to be done
by the time she gets back.

278
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,321
She won't even know we're here.

279
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:47,041
Just do what you need to do and move on.

280
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:48,641
Don't drink all the orange juice.

281
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:51,241
And don't get blood on the sofa.

282
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:00,881
Massey, stop by the gate.

283
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:10,281
You looking for business, darling?

284
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,921
You know, the last time
we had a chat like this off the record,

285
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,721
on the QT,
I swear you were wearing flares.

286
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,601
And you were wearing a sheepskin coat

287
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:44,361
and a pair of Foster Grants.

288
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:51,841
So what were you doing there, George,
mop-handed at a copper's house?

289
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,961
A police officer? One of your own.

290
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,601
Tell me. What did he do, rob a bank?

291
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:57,281
Possibly. I don't care.

292
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:58,681
Oh.

293
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,281
Well, you make me nostalgic
for the dead days,

294
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:04,001
Martin, time was you'd
have dragged me out of this motor

295
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,241
and beaten my tripes out
with a pickaxe handle.

296
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:08,161
As you say,

297
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,401
dead days.

298
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,881
Well, you tell that to your lad.

299
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,081
He's bent as a pin.

300
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:20,841
I met his lady friend.

301
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:22,241
God above.

302
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,721
Well, I can't answer
those questions, George,

303
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:34,041
without knowing precisely the nature
of your allegation.

304
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:38,321
And of the many crimes
I know you've committed

305
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,681
down the years, being a snitch

306
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:42,481
was never one of them.

307
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:45,641
Now, I don't know what's
going on between you and Luther,

308
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:50,601
but you need to stay away
from my officer, George.

309
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:53,241
Or I'll have you.

310
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,201
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,281
Have you managed to get a hold of Errol?

312
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:25,601
No.

313
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,761
It's going to be okay.

314
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:34,121
There's no way Cornelius is sending
his boys to your flat.

315
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,881
And to be fair, that's easy
for you to say.

316
00:31:38,361 --> 00:31:40,521
You haven't spent half the morning
spitting your teeth out.

317
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:43,041
Benny, I'm going to put this right.

318
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:45,921
Okay, I'm... I'm going to make it right
by you, mate.

319
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:47,001
How?

320
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:49,681
This isn't the militant wing

321
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:51,481
of the National Trust
we're dealing with here.

322
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,161
It's George Cornelius.
You don't go up against him.

323
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:58,521
You know, I always thought
she'd be the end of you.

324
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,201
I didn't think
she'd be the end of us all.

325
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:07,921
Yeah, well, Benny...

326
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:12,161
It's going to get worse.

327
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:14,161
A lot worse.

328
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,881
There's something Cornelius
doesn't know yet.

329
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:23,321
Shift's over, Donnie.
Go home and get some kip.

330
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,321
His Nibs all right up there?

331
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:29,641
Fine.

332
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,841
I haven't heard a peep since, er...

333
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:34,121
Since what?

334
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:36,521
The present.

335
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:41,841
The what?

336
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,401
The welcome-home present you asked for.

337
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:57,401
No.

338
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:04,321
George.

339
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,641
George.

340
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,601
She was just...

341
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,401
I didn't know.

342
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,401
She just...

343
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:20,921
She just walked in.

344
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,761
She just walked in.

345
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,321
Oh, Mr Lake.

346
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,401
The police were here again.

347
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:03,561
Mmm.

348
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:03,281
- Yes?
- Mr Palmer,

349
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,841
we spoke once before.

350
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,521
Just convenience, that's all.

351
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:11,841
What are you doing?

352
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,241
Work.

353
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:16,841
Can't avoid it. John.

354
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,081
What am I avoiding?

355
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:20,801
- Yes, Halliday, how'd you get on?
- Er, pretty good,

356
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,081
I think. Well, enough to be confident
that James Hauser

357
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:25,601
didn't kill anyone.

358
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,361
Er, boss?

359
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:29,481
-You there? Erm...
-Yeah, yeah.

360
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,681
Yeah, I'm here. Go on.

361
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:33,801
Okay, so I was looking through
the file last night and I saw something.

362
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:35,441
Just a small thing, really,

363
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:37,281
but on the back of it
I got some analysis done.

364
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,721
A CCTV image of the killer
and one of James Hauser.

365
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,921
And they're stood next to what
turned out to be identical lampposts.

366
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:47,681
It's two men. Similar heights,

367
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:48,761
but not identical.

368
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,601
Well, yeah, that doesn't mean
Hauser wasn't good for any of it.

369
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:54,201
I had this thing once,
it was two brothers...

370
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:56,241
Er, I think
this is a whole different thing.

371
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:59,401
I was talking to Celia yesterday
at the autopsy,

372
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:02,561
and she was talking about
what it takes to slice your own throat

373
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,641
without hesitation. Now, yes,

374
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,481
James Hauser was into self-mutilation,
but with pins and needles.

375
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:09,841
He liked insertion.

376
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:11,641
But slicing your own throat
with a scalpel,

377
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:13,201
that's a whole different proposition.

378
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,921
Now, who uses a scalpel?

379
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,481
And who's in a position
to manipulate James,

380
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,561
to put him exactly
where they want him to be?

381
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,561
Now I think he was a patsy,
and I think they've set him up

382
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,241
to look responsible for the crimes
committed by Jeremy Lake.

383
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:28,361
And the MRI scan.

384
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:31,081
Now, I think Jeremy was looking
at his own head.

385
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:34,201
Because whoever it is has a non-operable
tumour on his frontal lobe.

386
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,441
And now, if it is him, it could
be affecting his... His behaviour,

387
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,441
his judgment, disinhibiting him.

388
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,401
DCI Luther?

389
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:42,961
Yeah.

390
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:47,081
John, we've got a missing person.

391
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:48,681
Penny Leyton.

392
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:51,481
Her partner came home from work
last night and declared her missing.

393
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,761
Yeah, the local police have accessed
some CCTV footage.

394
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,081
I'm sending it through to you now.

395
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,761
I'll meet you as the hospital.

396
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,641
All right. Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm coming.

397
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,881
You have to be joking.

398
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:06,801
There's a woman missing.

399
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,081
So?

400
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:09,761
So I knew who took her.

401
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,641
- She's not your responsibility...
- She is my responsibility.

402
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,601
-We are.
-I knew, Alice.

403
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,801
I looked this prick in the eyes and I...

404
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:18,161
What, how? Did he forget to yawn?

405
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:23,481
-I let him go because I was...
-Of me?

406
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:25,921
Well, I'm flattered.

407
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:28,441
But I do hope you remember
that if it weren't for me,

408
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,081
you'd be dead or in prison.

409
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,281
Either way, you wouldn't be
galloping to anyone's rescue.

410
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:36,761
-I can't let this go. I just can't.
-You have to, John.

411
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:39,961
-George Cornelius is...
-I can handle George Cornelius.

412
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,201
No, you can't, John.

413
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,881
Not in the way you'd like to.

414
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,041
We're past that.

415
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:28,561
Oh.

416
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:30,585
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

417
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:07,921
-DCI Luther.
-George.

418
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,961
I'm sorry it's come to this,
but we are where we are.

419
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:15,361
Now, you have two options,
you bring it back from the brink, or...

420
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:17,281
- Or what?
- I take you down.

421
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:21,841
I take you, your family, everything.

422
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:23,281
Brick by brick.

423
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:25,481
You'll be the king
of a smoking hill, mate.

424
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:29,201
-You understand?
-My son is dead, John.

425
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:30,361
I know.

426
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:32,561
I know and it shouldn't have happened,
but it did.

427
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,281
Now take a step back.

428
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,841
Don't make me go to war.

429
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:44,441
You should have lied,
arranged a meeting.

430
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:45,521
No.

431
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:46,801
No point lying to him.

432
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,521
He'd have known.

433
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,361
Confirm transfer.

434
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,041
Here you go.

435
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,441
I had to try.

436
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,081
I know.

437
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,561
But you're right.

438
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:29,761
It's too far gone.

439
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,801
-He won't stop now.
-No.

440
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,401
I have to end it.

441
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,281
Yes.

442
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:39,281
Now.

443
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:46,201
Just got to take care
of this other thing first.

444
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:49,441
-John, you can't...
-Take it, leave it. I don't care, Alice.

445
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:52,721
Tonight, then.

446
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,681
Tonight.

447
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:55,961
Do you know how?

448
00:41:57,881 --> 00:41:59,001
I do know how.

449
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:06,961
-For what it's worth, I am sorry.
-No,

450
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:08,721
you're not.

451
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,041
Give this to Benny
and don't let Mark see it.

452
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:20,281
I'm not apologising for what's happened,

453
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:23,921
I'm regretting what's to come.

454
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:08,841
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- I can't believe

455
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:12,521
you did that, after everything you said,

456
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,401
all your promises.

457
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:17,881
- Viv, I'm not sure what you mean.
- I mean

458
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,561
the bitch in the basement.

459
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:03,481
Viv, darling, er, sorry,
but things have taken a turn.

460
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:04,641
You have to get rid of it.

461
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:07,161
You have to do whatever you can
as quickly as possible to get rid of it.

462
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,241
I'll explain when I can.

463
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:44,921
DCI Luther, how lovely of you
to put in an appearance.

464
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:48,081
Sorry, boss, I've had a funny old day.

465
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:52,201
Jeremy Lake left before we arrived,
but his car is still here.

466
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:53,841
I should have nicked him
when I had the chance.

467
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:55,201
There were no grounds.

468
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,641
- I should have made grounds.
- So,

469
00:44:58,161 --> 00:44:59,161
what made him run?

470
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:01,401
Sir, I was here earlier today.

471
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:04,561
Erm, yeah, maybe that spooked him.

472
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:05,841
You were here earlier?

473
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:07,321
Doing what?

474
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:08,401
Nothing, really.

475
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:10,881
Erm, I asked DS Halliday to interview

476
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,601
the secretary before

477
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,001
he came into work.

478
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,841
I mean, that couldn't have spooked him.
That was hours ago.

479
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:19,161
So why did he run?

480
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:21,681
What does he know
and how does he know it?

481
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,001
See, I don't think

482
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:24,681
that is the question
that's going to find him.

483
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:27,081
Then I'd like to know what is.

484
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:30,801
It's what she knows. Vivien Lake.

485
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:33,161
I don't think

486
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:36,641
that Vivien is his accomplice.

487
00:45:36,761 --> 00:45:40,081
I think she cleans up for him
and she hates him for it.

488
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,561
So does that mean
Vivien doesn't know about Penny Leyton?

489
00:45:43,401 --> 00:45:44,561
Let's find out.

490
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:05,521
It's okay.

491
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:28,681
It's okay.

492
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:38,481
It's okay.

493
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:56,161
Oh, God.

494
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:31,121
-Cheers.
-You're very welcome.

495
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:38,921
Hello, who's this?

496
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:40,961
Errol, it's Ben.

497
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:42,441
I'm just checking in.

498
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:44,161
- Did you not get my messages?
- Yeah.

499
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:45,521
I got the messages.

500
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,081
Where've you been?

501
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:49,361
My leg, mate.

502
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,321
Listen,

503
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:57,241
take whatever you want from the fridge,
don't scratch my records,

504
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:58,321
but whatever you do,

505
00:47:58,401 --> 00:48:00,281
keep your head down, all right, brother?

506
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:02,121
No worries. You okay?

507
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:03,681
Yeah.

508
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:05,321
Tickety-boo.

509
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:06,601
Sweet.

510
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:07,961
Cheers then, Ben.

511
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:09,481
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

512
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:15,801
So there's the number, okay?

513
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,041
It's a landline.

514
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:21,201
-Can I go now?
-In a moment.

515
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:24,601
Right now I need you to relax
for a few seconds, Errol.

516
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:26,921
Just a few seconds. We're nearly there.

517
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:36,841
I need you to trace a landline for me.

518
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:38,641
I'm sending the number now.

519
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:43,921
Okay, is that it?

520
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:45,841
Are we done?

521
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:54,361
That's it.

522
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:12,321
Vivien?

523
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:18,361
Vivien?

524
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,401
Nothing.

525
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:34,641
I'll put a trace on her phone.

526
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:37,561
I'll dig up CCTV
within a quarter-mile radius

527
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:39,321
and find out what time she left.

528
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:41,001
With an ANPR.

529
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,241
Boss.

530
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:44,481
Her car's still here.

531
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:56,481
Shut up!

532
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,361
-S
hut up! Shut up!
-No! I

533
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:03,801
Basement.

534
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:05,961
See if you can find a window,
or an open door or something.

535
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:14,561
I'm down here!

536
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:16,081
I'm down here!

537
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,201
Listen.

538
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:18,601
I was trying to save you from him.

539
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:20,641
From Jeremy. Please, don't say anything.

540
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:21,881
Please.

541
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:28,321
Shh...

542
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,121
-I'm in here!
-Shut up!

543
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,001
Shut up!

544
00:52:15,881 --> 00:52:16,881
Penny?

545
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:31,721
Penny?

546
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:39,201
Penny!

547
00:52:47,761 --> 00:52:48,761
Go!

548
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:54,521
Where is Jeremy?

549
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:57,081
Where is he? Vivien, where is he?

550
00:52:58,081 --> 00:52:59,521
Where is Jeremy?

551
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,681
Boss.

552
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:02,361
She needs medical attention.

553
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:04,881
Come here.

554
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:13,161
It's okay. It's okay.

555
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:22,761
Come here. Stop. Stop. Give us a second.

556
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:26,241
Look. Look,
you still have a way out of this.

557
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:29,681
Okay, you got a very solid defence,
coercive control.

558
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:32,521
You... You led your life in fear
of him, okay? So,

559
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:35,481
Help me to find him.

560
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:37,601
I will help you, I promise you that.

561
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,881
I think you're in need
of psychiatric assistance, Officer.

562
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,881
Get her out of here. Go on.

563
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:53,561
We've put out an urgent appeal.

564
00:53:53,721 --> 00:53:55,441
His face is all over the media.
We'll find him.

565
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:57,081
Not without her. Not in time.

566
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:01,561
- John?
- Ambulance.

567
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:04,561
Jeremy Lake.

568
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:06,961
He got away in an ambulance.
He must have. He must have.

569
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,401
Call the paramedic cruisers
and see where they dropped him off.

570
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:11,401
He must have done a ride-along.

571
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:14,881
Boss, I've got to take this. I'm sorry.

572
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:17,081
Mark, what's up?

573
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:18,921
John,
I need you to come back here.

574
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:22,161
Er, mate, I promise, as soon as I can,
I will, okay?

575
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:23,241
No, right now.

576
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,241
-I've got big problems, Mark.
-Well, I have a big problem here.

577
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:29,681
Yeah, what?

578
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:32,961
John, my girlfriend is on her way home,
I need you

579
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:35,281
to get your friends out of here.

580
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:39,161
Er, Mark, listen,
I'm at the office, okay?

581
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:41,761
Erm, can you...

582
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:44,161
I can't get out of that now.
Can I... Can I come back to you

583
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:45,241
on this?

584
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:49,801
When is that?

585
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:51,281
I don't know, Mark.

586
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:53,441
Two, three hours?

587
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:56,401
No, that's no good, John.

588
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:57,601
Remember what

589
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,801
she told you. If she sees you and Alice

590
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:00,961
around here...

591
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:02,441
Oh, yeah, okay.

592
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:03,681
Erm,

593
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:06,441
I'm about to step
into an autopsy, all right?

594
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,281
Can you give me two hours?
Can you do that?

595
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:15,521
John.

596
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:18,321
Yeah?

597
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:20,641
Mark tried,
but he oversold the lies.

598
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:23,481
But at least this way
we know where we stand.

599
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:25,441
I have a message for you

600
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,801
-from Mr Cornelius.
-I think I've got the message.

601
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,281
Hmm. I'm going to need you here, John.

602
00:55:31,641 --> 00:55:33,081
Why, so you can kill everyone?

603
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:34,241
Not everyone.

604
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:36,361
Just you and Alice.

605
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:39,561
Assuming you listen and do as I ask.

606
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,641
Er, he's lying, John. Er, oh...

607
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:43,201
Listen to me,

608
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,841
all right? I'll go to Cornelius.
I'll go to Cornelius right now.

609
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:48,881
I'll hand myself in, all right?
You can do what you want

610
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,321
to Alice, but you leave Benny

611
00:55:51,401 --> 00:55:52,921
and Mark alone. Do you understand me?

612
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,641
John, I need you to focus.

613
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:57,761
You're not in control here.
This isn't a situation you can leverage.

614
00:55:58,281 --> 00:55:59,841
Listen to me, you piece of shit!

615
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:01,881
If you hurt them, I swear to God

616
00:56:02,001 --> 00:56:03,721
I will rip your fucking heart out.
Do you understand me?

617
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:04,801
I'm not here to listen.

618
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:06,521
This isn't a dialogue.

619
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:08,241
And now your friend is dead.

620
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:09,601
John.

621
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,561
Mark. Just stop.

622
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:14,961
Just stop right now.

623
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,041
Leave him be.

624
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:18,601
None of this is his fault.

625
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:22,641
Benny, right?

626
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:24,321
That's right.

627
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:27,001
You're killing yourself, Benny.

628
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:30,401
Benny? Benny? Don't you fuck...
Don't you

629
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,521
say another word, Benny.

630
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:34,481
Boss, I need you to kill
this prick for me.

631
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:35,561
No, Benny! Don't

632
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:36,961
-say another word, Benny.
-White.

633
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,601
- 6'1".
- Benny.

634
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:40,481
- Dark hair.
- No.

635
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:41,961
Brown eyes.

636
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:43,201
Muscular build...

637
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,001
Jesus!

638
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:54,961
Here. Now. No more chat.

639
00:56:56,201 --> 00:56:58,401
You... All right, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

640
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:57,001
No!

641
00:57:57,025 --> 00:58:05,025
