1
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,081
Can you breathe?

2
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,201
Yeah.

3
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,601
Shame, that. Turn around.

4
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,681
Babylon beast!

5
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,881
You're a lying pig, Luther.

6
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,881
You ain't no better than me.

7
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,401
Get me out!

8
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,681
Whatever you are!

9
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,641
-See you SOON. Bye.
-Bye.

10
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,121
-Take care.
-Bye.

11
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,641
Wait! Miss.

12
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,521
Miss! It's Lee Peck.

13
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,961
You taught me in English.

14
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,041
Sorry, Miss.

15
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,001
Did I just scare you?

16
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:05,721
Yeah, you did. Yeah.

17
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,041
Miss, I'm sorry...

18
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,761
Go home, Lee.

19
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:46,441
What?

20
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,721
Oh, sh...

21
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,761
Miss! Miss, let me in!

22
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:04,121
Miss. Miss, just let me in yeah?

23
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:08,881
Miss! Miss! Let me in, Miss.

24
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,481
Miss, let me in.

25
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,641
-Lee, go home.
-Miss, please!

26
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:14,161
I'm calling the police.

27
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:16,121
-Miss, please...
-I'm doing it right now, Lee.

28
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,201
I'll get you fixed up, honest.

29
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:58,441
All right, all right, all right.
Hold on.

30
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,961
Just relax, all right? Don't... Don't!

31
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,161
Cuff him!

32
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,481
Take him.

33
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:34,881
Oh, God!

34
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:45,961
George, what is all this bollocks?

35
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:48,561
Where is he?

36
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,441
Where is who?

37
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,081
Fuck off.

38
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,641
-Where is he?
-Who, George, who?

39
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:05,441
I don't know who you're talking about.

40
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,361
That's my son.

41
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,601
-Alastair.
-Alastair, yes.

42
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,521
The elder one. Washes...

43
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,801
Washes the money for you, yeah.
What about him?

44
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:25,521
Allegedly. Okey-dokey.

45
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,041
Massey, please.

46
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,761
So, what we're gonna do is...

47
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:35,041
I'm gonna ask that question
a maximum of five more times.

48
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:43,121
Cornelius, I've no...

49
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,241
Where's my boy? Come on, John.
Hurry up. Where is he?

50
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,321
I have no clue.

51
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,321
And that's twice.

52
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:53,721
All right. I don't know. I don't know.

53
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,841
Last chance. Come on. Wake up, John.

54
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,881
Give me that.

55
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,401
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

56
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,801
So, what's going on?

57
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,081
-You really don't know, do you?
-No, I really don't know.

58
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:23,361
Where was he when he got taken?
Alastair? Where was he? Who was it?

59
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,241
Ah, see, now you're fishing.

60
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,521
Well, if you tell me who did it
then I might be able to help you.

61
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,961
I'm not a 12-year-old girl.
I take care of my own business.

62
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,481
You started this, George!

63
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,561
I'm just doing due diligence,
making sure you're not part of it.

64
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,881
What'd you say?

65
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:40,961
Part of it? Why would I be a part of it?

66
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,281
-We've got history.
-Not that kind of history.

67
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:52,641
Says the bloke who kidnapped me
and cuffed me to a radiator.

68
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,841
Yeah, fair dues.

69
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,641
-So, are we good?
-Are we good?

70
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:02,761
He's my boy, John.

71
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,641
Do me a favour, let me get on with it.

72
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:09,041
George. I don't care about you
and I don't care about your boy.

73
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,241
All I care about is going home.

74
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:13,481
Leave me alone.

75
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,441
Tell the Spice Girls
to back off as well.

76
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:41,481
DCI Luther.

77
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,801
I'll put the kettle on, shall I?

78
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,241
I see you're settling in.

79
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:57,481
Yeah. Yes, of course.
Listen, uh... Milk's in the fridge.

80
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,721
You know where everything is.
I'll be back in a second.

81
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:47,481
So... How's Catherine working out?

82
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,641
DS Halliday?

83
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:53,201
She's okay, I suppose. Why do you ask?

84
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:54,641
You don't like her?

85
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,281
Oh, it's not that. I'm...

86
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:02,321
Look, John, this,
uh, direct entry thing...

87
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,401
Head-hunting people
from the public sector,

88
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,881
fast-tracking them through the ranks...

89
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:07,881
None of us like it,
but that's the way it is.

90
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,521
Give it 10 minutes and DS Halliday
will be Superintendent Halliday.

91
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,081
Boss, are you, um,
telling me to behave myself?

92
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:23,401
I'm saying that we're the dinosaurs
and she's the meteor.

93
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,001
So, yes.

94
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,361
Don't show her how it's done.

95
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:30,201
Show her how it's supposed to be done.

96
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,441
-Noted.
-Good.

97
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,721
I hope so.

98
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:39,241
It is so. Luther.

99
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,801
All right. We're on our way.

100
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:45,481
Think we gotta go somewhere, boss.

101
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,201
DS Halliday.

102
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,121
Morning.

103
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:15,641
Morning.

104
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:22,321
-Can I borrow a pen?
-Yeah, sure.

105
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,921
The killer took his eyes
and cut his tongue out.

106
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,481
All right.

107
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,681
Keep it.

108
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,241
-No, I couldn't. It's a lovely pen.
-Honestly. It's my gift to you.

109
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,001
Thanks.

110
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,881
The killer chased him from
Ballarat Street just around the corner.

111
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,161
All right.

112
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,401
Um, can I ask... Um, is...

113
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:04,001
Is this normal?

114
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,201
Normal?

115
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,161
Thanks.

116
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,081
Witness hasn't a clue
as to what happened.

117
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:32,441
The victim's an ex-pupil, Lee Peck.
He followed her home.

118
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:35,201
Next thing she knows,
he's banging on her door,

119
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:36,481
pleading to be let in.

120
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,441
Seems like the killer came from nowhere.

121
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,521
I would like
to talk to the witness.

122
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,641
Benny.

123
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:35,001
Mate, um... I need a favour.

124
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:37,121
An off-the-books type favour.

125
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,401
Oh, yeah? I thought
we're behaving ourselves these days.

126
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,601
No, we are. It won't be a problem.

127
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:42,681
Says who?

128
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,521
Well, then. What do you need?

129
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,401
Someone's got George Cornelius
on the hook.

130
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,481
All right? I need to find out who it is.

131
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,601
Why do we care?

132
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,001
I don't know. I, um...

133
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:57,921
It just doesn't feel right.

134
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,041
So, I'm just gonna have
a little nose about,

135
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:04,881
and not fuss with warrants
or anything like that?

136
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,721
No, no, no, no.

137
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,561
Go on, then. You talked me into it,
you silver-tongued devil.

138
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,121
Cheers.

139
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,201
All right. So, where are we?

140
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,881
First victim's Paul Redford,

141
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:34,001
29, landscape gardener.

142
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:37,001
-Single and ready to mingle.
-What does that mean?

143
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,721
Oh, he used a number
of online hook-up sites.

144
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,921
Oh, let's hope we're not looking
at another Steven Port.

145
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,761
Lab's looking for GHB
and other drugs.

146
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:49,321
But Port, he liked to incapacitate,
rape and then murder his victims.

147
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,001
He didn't do anything like this.

148
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:54,081
-Nothing similar on the books?
-No, nothing close.

149
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,721
All right. Well, you know,
this isn't our boy's first disco.

150
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,561
I mean, even Jack the Ripper
had to work up

151
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:03,241
towards what he did to Mary Jane Kelly.

152
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,761
And our boy hasn't got to this place
from a standing start.

153
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:08,601
Nope.

154
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,001
Okay, first up, um...

155
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:15,201
Let's see if there's an up tick
on people being assaulted in public.

156
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:19,121
Stabbed in the groin, the buttocks
with a pen-knife or big pin...

157
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,201
Like a hat pin.

158
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,441
-A what?
-A hat pin.

159
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:27,201
It's like a long pin, um,
like, this big. You can use it for...

160
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:28,561
I've seen those.

161
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:33,401
And then let's check, uh,
recent prison releases

162
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:35,961
of men that generally fit the pattern.

163
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:37,641
What about the other victim?

164
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,921
- Any connection?
- Uh, no.

165
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:43,081
It looks like an acute case
of wrong place, wrong time.

166
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,521
Hmm.

167
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,721
What does this say to you,
the eyes and the tongue?

168
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,921
Uh, symbolic punishment?

169
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,121
For what?

170
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,001
Intruding on a private act, maybe?

171
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:01,201
And this business, how has he done that?

172
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:06,081
That's LEDs sewn into his hood,
it confuses CCTV.

173
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:08,321
Ah, okay.
So, this isn't random, is it?

174
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,441
Which means there's gonna be more.

175
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,721
Couldn't keep them out.

176
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,361
Nowhere near it.

177
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,601
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

178
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:15,921
Yeah. Who's this?

179
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,441
-It is I, Krampus.
-Benny?

180
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:21,281
The half goat, half demon creature
who punishes naughty children.

181
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,681
Bad time. What's up?

182
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,841
-Listen, mate. I need a favour.
-Of course. Totally.

183
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,521
-What? Seriously?
-No.

184
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,361
Then you leave me no alternative,

185
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:33,201
but to huff and puff
and blow your walls down.

186
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,601
How are you gonna do that, then?

187
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,841
By telling Mr Cornelius
that you're on the skim.

188
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,801
Well, I haven't.

189
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,561
And that's mad because he'd kill anyone
who did something like that.

190
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,281
How do you even know this shit?

191
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:51,561
Big lad, you need to brush up
on your online security. Hmm.

192
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:20,841
Benny?

193
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,201
Yeah.

194
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,921
Oh, cool. Nice one. All right.

195
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:27,641
All right, um...

196
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,761
If anything comes up,
you let me know, okay?

197
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,641
Okay, sure. Um, cool. Where will you be?

198
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:34,241
-Out.
-Yep. Cool. Sure.

199
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:52,721
Errol.

200
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:56,041
If they catch me wearing this,
I'm dead about 18 times.

201
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:57,921
He'll feed me to his dogs.

202
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,041
-I'm not joking.
-Well, don't get caught, then.

203
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:02,801
Actual dogs.

204
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,841
He's got dogs, like them '70s dogs.

205
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:06,201
-Errol...
-Dobermanns.

206
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,721
I just need to know
what's going on, all right? That's it.

207
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,681
I don't even know anything. Huh?

208
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,441
He just wants me there for a bit
of extra va-va-voom. That's all.

209
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,241
I'm numbers, mate. I'm muscle.

210
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,641
I just need you in the room, listening.

211
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,121
That's all. All right?

212
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:21,681
Don't say nothing,
don't go asking any questions,

213
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,401
just let us listen.

214
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:42,161
Everyone, keep your wig on. Keep schtum.

215
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:53,921
Afternoon.

216
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,001
Look, we all want the money,

217
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:00,121
but my son has nothing to do with this.

218
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,721
It's not how we do things
in the civilised world.

219
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:06,201
Or what's left of it.

220
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,281
All right, all right.

221
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,961
You get your money. I get my boy.

222
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,121
And that's it.

223
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,681
I'll meet you there. Close of play.

224
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,321
Right.

225
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,361
I want this place watched.

226
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,121
Like a hen-night in Saudi.

227
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,001
All right, off we toddle.

228
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:35,201
Are you all right, Errol?
You're looking a bit peaky.

229
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:39,161
No, I'm good, George.

230
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,561
Really?

231
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,761
You're coming across as a bit clammy,
to be honest.

232
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:50,641
Yeah, uh, just... Just sweaty.
It's a family thing.

233
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,601
On my mum's side.

234
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,281
Delightful.

235
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,121
Somebody point a gun
into Errol's face, please.

236
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,161
Just one.

237
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:04,921
Oh, mate.

238
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:12,041
Do me a favour, Errol. Lift your shirt.

239
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:15,921
Oh, you don't have to bend over, mate.
Just lift your shirt.

240
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:19,801
I can't do that.

241
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,521
- Stop. All right. All right.
- Fair enough.

242
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,041
Bloody hell.

243
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:32,521
Hello, hello, hello.

244
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:34,521
What's all this?

245
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,201
Oh, the German.

246
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,121
I suppose this goes to show
you really don't have a scooby

247
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,201
about what's going on.

248
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:43,721
But you're still curious,
me little tinker.

249
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,641
So, here's what we do.

250
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:48,761
You can follow me if you like.

251
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:53,041
Or you can save poor old Errol here.

252
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:01,761
Remember what happened to Harry Samson.

253
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,881
What happened to Harry Samson?

254
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:25,401
What did happen to Harry Samson?

255
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:31,281
Harry Samson.
They blew his head off.

256
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,881
So, where do you think
they're taking him?

257
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,801
Somewhere quiet, privacy,

258
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:36,881
a bit of distance,
a bit of real estate, where...

259
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:44,561
Where would they go?
Where would they go?

260
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:45,841
Come on. Come on, John.

261
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,721
No, no, no, no.

262
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,241
Come on!

263
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:19,881
Hello.

264
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,121
Police.

265
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,801
Come on, man!

266
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,081
What? What is this thing? What is it?

267
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:55,201
Ten minutes?
What happens in ten minutes?

268
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,681
-It goes off.
-No. No!

269
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,801
-The key.
-Wait, wait. No. You can't do that.

270
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,121
Hey! Wait!

271
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:17,281
Minty, where are you?

272
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:20,721
I've got this...
This thing around my neck.

273
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,441
This metal thing. I think it's a bomb.

274
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:24,521
- Minty, calm down.
- I can't calm down.

275
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:27,001
-I've got this thing around my neck!
-Relax.

276
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:29,041
We lost you at 10 Cory Road.

277
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,561
-We turned on Brandon Street.
-Where?

278
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,961
-I think, then... Then, uh...
-Brandon?

279
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,001
All right. Okay, okay.
I know where he is.

280
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,081
Benny... Benny!

281
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:43,081
Benny!

282
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,321
Benny!

283
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:55,681
-Miss Halliday.
-God, where are you?

284
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:58,161
Um, tip line got a call

285
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,841
from a consultant psychiatrist,
a Dr Vivien Lake.

286
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,841
She's worried about one
of the patients, "escalating risk."

287
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,241
Okay, do you like him for it?

288
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:07,881
I dunno. It sounds interesting.

289
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,201
-Well, excellent, bring her in.
-I know, I've already sent a car.

290
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,201
Good. Okay, as soon as I can,
I'll be back.

291
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,281
Yeah.

292
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:15,961
What's he doing up, by the way?

293
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:18,041
- Minty!
- I'm in here.

294
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,961
-You better be alone.
-Yeah, yeah, I'm alone. Come on, man!

295
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,441
Come on. Go, go, go.

296
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:24,601
All right, let's have a look.

297
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:26,481
-Go, go, go, go. Oh, God.
-Just shut up. Just shut up.

298
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,721
- Shh.
- Come on, man!

299
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:30,321
-I can't help you, man.
-What? No.

300
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,321
Wait, wait, wait. There's a key.
He threw the key over there.

301
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,601
-Where?
-Over there in the corner.

302
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:35,881
Benny, you have a quick look.

303
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:39,441
Come on. Come on, man.

304
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:41,281
-Come on!
-Just relax.

305
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,361
All right.

306
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,001
-Come on.
-I don't think I can open this.

307
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,321
Yeah, man, you can do it.

308
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:48,801
-I'm not gonna be able to...
-Yes, you can do it.

309
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:49,961
No lock's unpickable.

310
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,961
-This might be. It's pick-resistant.
-What does that mean?

311
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,961
It means I can't pick it, Minty, relax.

312
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,401
Of course, you can open it.
Of course you can.

313
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,241
That's not the attitude. Pick it.
Get the job done.

314
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:00,641
-Come on!
-Benny, how are you looking?

315
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,081
I swear to God, I can't see it.

316
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,601
-In the corner!
-What corner?

317
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:09,001
Corner, corner, corner... Hurry up!
Hurry up.

318
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:11,361
Oh, my God. Oh, come on, man.

319
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:12,801
Come on!

320
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,241
- Relax, okay? Just relax.
- All right!

321
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,241
Benny?

322
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:30,721
What's that? What does that look mean?
What's that look?

323
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:31,801
What does that look mean?

324
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:33,041
-Benny?
-Yeah.

325
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:35,161
-You should go.
-Come on, come on, come on!

326
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:37,161
- Start moving!
- Find the key!

327
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:39,441
-Find the key!
-Oh, I've got it.

328
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:40,841
Look, he's got it. He's got it.

329
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:43,161
-Come on!
-Go, go. Right there.

330
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:45,481
Open it, open it. Unlock it.

331
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:46,961
Come on, come on.

332
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:51,641
Yes, yes!

333
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,041
All right. Come on.

334
00:28:57,641 --> 00:28:58,641
In there!

335
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:00,665
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

336
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:57,881
Errol.

337
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,401
I'll make sure you're looked after
until this is all put to bed, all right?

338
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,441
It won't be put to bed, though, will it?

339
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:08,761
You've opened up a can of...

340
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,121
Not worms. I don't know, geese.

341
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,721
I'll sort it.

342
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,961
-I promise.
-Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

343
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,041
Because everyone knows
you do magic, yeah?

344
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:49,481
Yeah, you run.

345
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:51,841
I'll find you.

346
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,441
I'll get you.

347
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,241
Dr Lake, I'm DCI Luther.

348
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:12,081
-Did they offer you tea, coffee?
-Yeah, they have. Thanks.

349
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,321
Um...

350
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:18,161
You wanted to bring one of your patients
to our attention.

351
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,601
James Hauser, yeah.

352
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,401
So, what can you tell us?

353
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:23,201
He's a very troubled man.

354
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:26,001
Dealing with a number
of intersecting paraphilias,

355
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:30,441
he was the victim of profound
and systematic childhood abuse.

356
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,201
Unspeakable abuse, really.

357
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:37,081
And to avoid any doubt,
um, paraphilia means...

358
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,441
Sexual fetishes,
abnormal sexual impulses.

359
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,761
-The nature of his...
-Impulses?

360
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:45,521
Piquerism.
From the French piguer, "to prick."

361
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:49,161
At the age of 13, he stabbed a classmate
in the buttocks with a school compass,

362
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,801
and experienced his first orgasm.

363
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:54,601
-Classmate, female?
-Male.

364
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:55,921
He attended boarding school,

365
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,401
but there were female victims
during his student days,

366
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,161
and later, sex workers
of both sexes and genders.

367
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:04,681
He paid to stab them in the buttocks,

368
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:07,401
thighs, particularly the area
around the navel.

369
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:10,241
- Using a...
- Usually the point of a scalpel.

370
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,401
Just the tip.

371
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:20,121
There isn't a person in the world
without a sexual secret. DS...

372
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,641
Uh, Halliday.

373
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,401
You know, we all have a fantasy.
We all have a fetish.

374
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,681
We all regret something we've done.

375
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,361
Something we never had
the courage to do.

376
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,801
So, what's changed? Why come in today?

377
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:36,481
His condition's been escalating.

378
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,881
He hasn't made
his last couple of appointments.

379
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:43,161
And last night, he turned up
at my house uninvited.

380
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:44,241
He...

381
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:47,121
- There was blood on him.
- His blood?

382
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,641
I presumed so, at first, yes.

383
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:55,161
Self mutilation isn't uncommon in people
struggling with extreme desire. But...

384
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:58,201
I went to wash his wounds.
There were no wounds.

385
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:00,841
I asked him to wait in the lounge

386
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,041
while I went into my office to call
the police to take him to a safe place.

387
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:07,081
Before I could place the call,
he'd gone.

388
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:09,561
He's not answering his phone or e-mails,

389
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:13,601
so I decided to seek the advice
of a colleague and come forward.

390
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:17,201
As his fantasies became more extreme,

391
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:19,841
he became too ashamed
to articulate them.

392
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:23,401
So, I asked
if he could draw them for me.

393
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,001
Freeze. Nobody move.

394
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,441
Stop the bus!

395
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:04,601
Cheers.

396
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:10,161
We think it's him.

397
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:12,961
The driver tried to intervene.

398
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,441
We're going after him with full force.

399
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,561
We've got aerial units,
ground units, dogs.

400
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,161
We've got his house, his workplace,

401
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,961
all of his usual haunts
under surveillance.

402
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:24,961
-Are you...
-Yeah, I'm fine.

403
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,841
You're not fine. Nobody is.

404
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,481
No, I'm fine.

405
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:35,121
Well, good. He's not going home, is he?
I mean, not now.

406
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:38,521
It's not gonna stop. Not after this.
Not until we stop him.

407
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:40,561
So, what next?

408
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,201
Now, we play dirty.

409
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:46,681
The psychiatrist.
Did she seem normal to you?

410
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,641
I don't know. I guess
she came across a bit intense,

411
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,881
a bit too invested in her patient.

412
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,361
Well, she did come forward
with his name.

413
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:57,001
Yeah, but reluctantly.
‘Cause I think she had to.

414
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,401
I don't know how deep it goes,

415
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:03,441
but I don't think we're looking
at a normal doctor-patient relationship.

416
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:06,801
Well, it does happen sometimes
between patients and their therapists,

417
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:09,521
they call it countertransference.
It can get intense.

418
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:10,601
Ah, good.

419
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:13,441
Whatever psycho-sexual thing
they got going on, we can exploit it.

420
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:17,001
- Wait. Can we do that?
- Within parameters.

421
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:22,161
Okay. Bring her in. Push her buttons.
See what pops up.

422
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:29,401
Have you done this before?

423
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:31,641
Yeah. Well, something like this.

424
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,561
And you're definitely okay with it?
Like, ethically?

425
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:36,161
I don't know about ethically,

426
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:38,201
but as long as it's legal,
I'm okay with it.

427
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:40,281
Okay.

428
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,841
Dr Lake, we're sorry
to have to do this to you,

429
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,401
but we urgently need to know
the whereabouts of your patient,

430
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,401
and we believe you might be able
to help us with that.

431
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,601
Has he been in contact with you
since we last spoke?

432
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:53,681
No.

433
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:55,361
And do you have any idea
where he might be,

434
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:57,921
-where he might go to hide?
-Well, I'm hardly his keeper.

435
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,561
Uh, no. No. But you do have
a responsibility to him.

436
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:05,001
Which I believe I exercised
by coming forward.

437
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,561
Boss.

438
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:40,401
James Houser's phone's just come on.
He's in Hampstead woods.

439
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:43,641
This is Schenk.

440
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:46,881
Get a CO19 to Hampstead woods
and have them take up position.

441
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,841
And what about
your responsibility to his victims?

442
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,841
Well, I'd imagine it's "alleged victims"
at this stage, isn't it?

443
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,801
Okay. Why don't you just show her?

444
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:09,521
Well, this really is a tawdry form
of manipulation, isn't it?

445
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,081
Frankly, I expected better.

446
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,641
Dr Lake, look...

447
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:15,001
You know him.

448
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,561
I care about his well-being, yeah,

449
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:18,441
but I have
no emotional attachment to him.

450
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,281
- Which is a good thing.
- Why?

451
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,001
I don't think he's gonna stop
until we kill him.

452
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:28,561
Oh, dear God, how clear can I be? Look.

453
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:31,201
I'm happy to give you any information

454
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:34,161
that might help in protecting
the lives of others, but...

455
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,881
It's your job to actually catch him.

456
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:41,161
I cannot, and I will not
help you do that.

457
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:45,481
That girl on the bus
was 23 years old.

458
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:48,281
Now, I could tell you
exactly what he did to her,

459
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:51,081
before he slit the bus driver's throat
and ran away,

460
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:53,361
but I don't wanna hear myself
saying those things.

461
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:54,881
Do you understand that?

462
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:57,081
I don't wanna hear myself
saying the things

463
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,521
that your patient did in there.

464
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:01,961
Well, look, I'm happy to suggest
a good therapist, if that's any help.

465
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:04,721
And what if we were to arrest you?

466
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:08,361
-On what grounds?
-Obstructing justice.

467
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:09,761
Okay, um...

468
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:13,081
Call me if you change your mind.

469
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,601
Come on.

470
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:23,321
Oh, God. So, it turns out I'm not fine.

471
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,881
All right, look,
she's not gonna help voluntarily, okay?

472
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:31,841
She's good and spooked on his behalf,
you guys listening in?

473
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:33,921
7am,
and you're bang on the money.

474
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,321
He's talking to her right now.

475
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:38,321
- From where?
- Hampstead Woods.

476
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:40,441
Seventy acres of open woodland.

477
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:42,401
Multiple points of ingress and egress.

478
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:45,201
If he gives us the slip there,
we'll never find him again, John,

479
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:47,041
so we need her to lead us to him.

480
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:49,001
Yeah, I know, she's good and primed.

481
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:51,081
She thinks she's saving him
from the filth.

482
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,241
She could be right.

483
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:59,401
James, remember,
you can control this.

484
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:02,001
You have to think ahead.

485
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:04,521
You have to think of the consequences.

486
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:12,761
-I don't think I can stop.
-Yes, you can.

487
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:14,081
You can.

488
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,641
You need to remember what we discussed.

489
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:19,321
You need to remember your strategies.

490
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:21,481
You didn't call me
because you were aroused,

491
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,201
you called me because you know

492
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:25,441
you shouldn't be putting yourself
in this situation.

493
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,321
You need to remember
what we talked about.

494
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:31,681
Can you come here?

495
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:34,681
Can you do that?

496
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:37,921
Now?

497
00:44:41,361 --> 00:44:44,241
James, if you don't let me help you,
they're going to hurt you.

498
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,561
And I couldn't bear that, so, please.

499
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:49,121
Let me come to you.

500
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:51,081
I'll hide you.

501
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:53,441
I'll keep you safe.

502
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:56,761
Please.

503
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:00,881
Hampstead Wood.

504
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:16,521
She's leaving.

505
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:24,241
And the CO19 are in position.

506
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:26,881
- Stay with her.
- Two minutes away.

507
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:30,321
You want him dead?

508
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:33,521
I don't care. I just want him.

509
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:59,081
She's entering the woods
just south of the basketball court.

510
00:46:38,801 --> 00:46:39,801
James?

511
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:42,321
Come with me, please.

512
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:47,761
You can hurt me, if you like.

513
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:57,241
All units.

514
00:46:58,201 --> 00:46:59,281
On my signal.

515
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:05,001
I'd like you to cut me.

516
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:21,241
- I didn't. I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
- No!

517
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:22,801
James! Don't do it.

518
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:26,761
Go, go!

519
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,521
James!

520
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,401
James!

521
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:50,441
Oh, my God.

522
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:53,801
God, he's cut his own throat.

523
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:56,241
God. Jesus Christ.

524
00:49:08,121 --> 00:49:10,761
Look at me. Look at me.

525
00:49:11,641 --> 00:49:12,721
I'll call it in.

526
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:37,641
You followed me.

527
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:40,961
Yeah.

528
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:44,001
And asking for my help, what was that?

529
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:46,521
Manipulation? Gameplay?

530
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,001
Yeah.

531
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:55,281
You have no idea what he endured,
what was done to him.

532
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:57,601
He was a good man.

533
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:00,161
Pig. Filth.

534
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:04,961
Take her away, please. Get a statement.

535
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:04,521
Oh.

536
00:51:06,001 --> 00:51:07,321
Who do we have here?

537
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,001
Wow.

538
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,681
You didn't have to cut me.

539
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:49,321
Are you listening to me?
Look what you did to my arm.

540
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,241
That is the last time
I humiliate myself for you.

541
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:54,321
Okay?

542
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:57,081
That is the last time you ever hurt me.

543
00:51:57,161 --> 00:51:58,241
James better be dead.

544
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:16,401
Catherine?

545
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:20,521
It's way past time you went home.

546
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:23,441
Yeah. No, yeah. Sorry.

547
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,281
Is everything all right?

548
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:31,601
It's just... Something's wrong.
It's not right.

549
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:35,201
Have you discussed this with DCI Luther?

550
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:36,721
Well, I've tried calling him
over and over,

551
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:38,201
but he's not answering, so...

552
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:41,201
-How convinced are you?
-Nine out of ten.

553
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:43,241
Eight.

554
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:45,961
No, nine. Yeah, nine.

555
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:48,401
Then let's go and see him together.

556
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:52,001
Okay.

557
00:55:17,601 --> 00:55:20,001
Luther. He knew. He must have known.

558
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:13,801
All right, all right.

559
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,281
Wotcha.

560
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:33,305
