1
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:13,281
Okay, so where do I meet him?

2
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:14,761
Well, apparently,

3
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,321
there's a bench
on the north side of the promenade

4
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:24,601
on the corner of, erm,
Spitsenstraat and Houtdok-Noordkaai.

5
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,241
They'll meet you there.

6
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,081
And you're sure
he's ready to pay?

7
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,881
Mmm-hmm.

8
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,281
Merci.

9
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,521
Jacob, how did it go?

10
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,361
It's all gone according to plan.

11
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,441
My men will have your diamonds by now.

12
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:38,721
Thank you.

13
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,921
All right, all right.

14
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:35,481
Wotcha.

15
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,481
Don't pretend you're not pleased
to see me.

16
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,081
I'm not.
I'm a bit surprised you're alive.

17
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,321
I didn't come looking for joy
unconfined, just a...

18
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,121
place to hide.

19
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:53,761
Maybe a cup of tea
and a chocolate digestive.

20
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,201
Please.

21
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:58,081
Nope.

22
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,641
Oh...

23
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:09,561
# Love is like a sin, my love

24
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:16,881
# For the ones
that feel it the most

25
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:23,921
# Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

26
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:29,121
# She will love you like a fly

27
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,161
# Will never love you again #

28
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:58,881
Ow.

29
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:00,521
Ugh.

30
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:11,801
ow!

31
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,601
Ah!

32
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,721
Ah. Ow.

33
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,721
Alice,

34
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:32,881
I don't want anything to do with it.

35
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:35,241
I want you patched up

36
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,241
and out of the door.
Do you understand me?

37
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:40,961
ow.

38
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,481
ow! Ow.

39
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:45,081
So, what happened?

40
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,161
A big boy did it and ran away.

41
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,801
Mmm.

42
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,001
You robbed me, George.

43
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:23,321
I can understand why you think that,
but,

44
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,721
they stole from us both.

45
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,121
All right, what do you want?
I'm a thief. I've robbed you.

46
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,481
How was I to know you're basically
the Tasmanian Devil?

47
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,041
Make the transfer.

48
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:40,681
Pay what you owe, plus, erm,
20% for the inconvenience.

49
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,161
I'm afraid I have to decline.

50
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,121
I beg your pardon?

51
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,081
I'm not buying what you're selling.

52
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,121
I'm selling your son, George.

53
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:02,521
Even so.

54
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:06,961
You crack me up, George.

55
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:10,201
You really do.
But I really am going to need that money

56
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:13,481
or I'll take Alice's head to the zoo
and feed it to the monkeys.

57
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,241
Oh, no, come now.
You're not gonna do that here.

58
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,241
ow.

59
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,521
Kidnapped his son
and tried to do him over.

60
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:36,561
ow!

61
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,881
George and I had a little chat.

62
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,961
-Oh.
-I say "chat".

63
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,601
He beat the crap out of me.

64
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,961
ow!

65
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,841
-Oh.
-Ah.

66
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:50,761
Ah. I see... OW!

67
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,681
Hold up. Hold up.

68
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,041
Sorry, boss.

69
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:40,281
I've been reading this

70
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:42,281
and it's James Hauser's
psychiatric file.

71
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,321
Something's off.

72
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:47,681
All right, yeah, erm...
Come on in.

73
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,081
Come on, yeah.

74
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,201
Close the door behind you.

75
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,521
So, Vivien Lake gives us her patient's
psychological history.

76
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:02,201
It talks a lot about his shame

77
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,281
and anxiety.

78
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,921
Now, the actual file talks a lot

79
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,681
about his obsession with
suicidal ideation, I mean,

80
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,761
-a lot.
-Does she mention

81
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,961
that he's a suicide risk?

82
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,721
-Not once.
-Let's have a look.

83
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,281
So...

84
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,721
...what if you're right?
What if she did cross the line?

85
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:22,721
Vivien Lake and James Hauser
in a psychosexual...

86
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,321
...Jamboree. A big old bag of wrong?

87
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,321
Speaking of which, erm,

88
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:37,441
do you mind if I...

89
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,561
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Upstairs, first on the right.

90
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:54,281
Well, Hauser spirals out of control,
Vivien's now implicated.

91
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,281
She faces ruination, maybe prison.

92
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,081
But the one thing we knew about him,
or thought we knew,

93
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,321
or whatever,
he didn't want to get caught.

94
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,961
He was audacious,
but he was also careful.

95
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,121
With the masks, with the cameras,
the escape routes...

96
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,681
...decides to kill himself
rather than get arrested.

97
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,841
Maybe he's ashamed? I mean, he could be.

98
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,281
Who knows what drives someone
to kill themselves, right?

99
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:30,961
Except in this case, someone knows.
Vivien Lake.

100
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,441
Yeah?

101
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:57,521
Er, oh, boss?

102
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,801
I think DS Halliday is on to something.

103
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:11,921
I think she probably is.

104
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:13,921
Yes.

105
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,241
So, erm,

106
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,601
what's the next step? How...
How do we play it?

107
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,761
Well, it won't be easy.

108
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:28,041
Her defences are up. She's calculating.

109
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,841
She's intelligent and she's got nerve.

110
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:37,161
Besides, we don't have any hard evidence
of wrongdoing.

111
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,361
No, we don't.

112
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,161
Is she married?

113
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,721
Eighteen years.

114
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,801
Happily?

115
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,401
Apparently.

116
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,201
Why?

117
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:52,161
Well, the happier the marriage,
the easier it is to weaponise.

118
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,761
And the Cynic of the Year Award
goes to...

119
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,441
No, I'm not a cynic.

120
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:00,561
That's basically my problem.

121
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,481
I think we, er, pay the husband a visit

122
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:07,241
and then see how Vivien Lake reacts.

123
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,441
Guv?

124
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:14,841
Yeah.

125
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:34,721
And you're off.

126
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:57,561
Oh, sod this.

127
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,241
He thinks you're my weak spot.

128
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:13,041
He thinks he can hurt me by hurting you.

129
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,041
Bollocks.

130
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,841
- No, no.
- No!

131
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:26,921
No!

132
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:28,945
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

133
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,081
Go and check.

134
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,961
No, no, no!

135
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:02,321
What's the rule?

136
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:08,921
Play safe.

137
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:12,721
And did you?

138
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:16,881
No.

139
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:19,281
No.

140
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:24,481
James was our one contingency.

141
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:27,681
Took me months to lay the groundwork.

142
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:30,481
And now it's thrown away.

143
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,601
Just used up.

144
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,281
Wasted.

145
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:40,161
I'm sorry.

146
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,681
I hope you know I can't go back
to my house until this is put right.

147
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,281
What if it can't be put right?

148
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,641
No, I want my life back
the way it was until you pitched up.

149
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:55,721
It will be put right.

150
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,561
- Sorry!
- You're really not.

151
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:00,561
What do you want me to say?

152
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,961
I've rather missed all this.

153
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,121
-So have you, probably.
-I really haven't.

154
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:06,841
-Oh, pish.
-Look at my face.

155
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,161
-Shh!
-Look at it!

156
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,361
-Oh...
-Er...

157
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,521
-What about this one?
-Yeah, yeah. Hurry up.

158
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,321
-Just...
-No, I got it.

159
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:15,401
Shit, come on.

160
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,521
Ah, magic.

161
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,841
Well, she sounds very keen.

162
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,801
-Who?
-Your new bestie. What's her name?

163
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:39,001
Anne of Green Gables, erm,
I don't know, Heidi.

164
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:41,481
-Halliday.
-"Halliday." Oh! Oh, that's interesting.

165
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,721
What is?

166
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,121
Well, the impersonal use of her surname.

167
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,361
Are you trying to un-sex her in my mind?

168
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,481
No.

169
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,121
Because, honestly, why on Earth
would you do that?

170
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:55,681
I just don't want you turning her face
into a...a handbag.

171
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:00,961
How did you do it?

172
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,361
Does it matter?

173
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:04,801
Yes, it matters.

174
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,281
I saw the murder report.

175
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,561
Your body on the slab.
I saw all of that.

176
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:16,441
Oh, John, don't be insulting.

177
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,681
There's not much you can't buy
from a retiring officer

178
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,361
with a crappy pension
and a chip on his shoulder.

179
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,601
All T wanted to do

180
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:27,641
was die, disappear,
and leave you in peace.

181
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,881
But George Cornelius put paid to that,

182
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,601
and that's why
I'm back to rap his knuckles.

183
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:36,921
Is that all you're back for?

184
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,681
What else is there?

185
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:43,641
You couldn't just walk away?

186
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:44,881
No, of course not.

187
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:46,881
I had to be dead.

188
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,721
That's how all your
best relationships end.

189
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,361
You look very handsome.

190
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,641
I like your tie.

191
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,961
You bought it for me.

192
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,921
-Milan.
-I remember.

193
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,161
You wore it the night you kicked
that Somali rent-boy half to death.

194
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:20,961
No more risks.

195
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:23,761
No.

196
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,521
We have to be absolutely sure

197
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:29,081
you're not developing any problems
with impulse control.

198
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:32,721
I'm not.

199
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,801
Because what's the rule?

200
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:39,841
Play safe.

201
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,001
Play safe.

202
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,241
Honestly.

203
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,361
Girl on the bus, she went... So scared.

204
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,001
Be that as it may,

205
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,281
don't let it happen again.

206
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,201
You need to be more careful.

207
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,321
DCI Luther sends
his apologies.

208
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,801
You've got me today, I'm afraid.

209
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,881
DCI Luther brings cake.

210
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:22,241
-He does?
-Usually.

211
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,561
Are we talking about
the same DCI Luther?

212
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,241
Big chap, likes cake.

213
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:27,961
You're going to need a bucket.

214
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,561
Er, for what?

215
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:31,081
To be sick into.

216
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,521
Do people really do that?

217
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:33,681
Now and again.

218
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,041
Too much cake.

219
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,761
Perhaps we should crack on.

220
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:42,041
There's a deep, obliquely-placed
incise neck injury

221
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,161
at the front side of the neck.

222
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:45,521
There are no other injuries.

223
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:49,681
No hesitation cuts, no defence injuries.

224
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:53,841
The pattern of the injury
is consistent with suicide.

225
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,241
That he cut his own throat
and bled to death.

226
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:03,201
Er, the lack of hesitation injuries,
how significant is that?

227
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,681
Ordinarily, I'd say very.

228
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:09,601
It's quite an endeavour to take
a scalpel to your own throat

229
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:11,681
and do this without wavering.

230
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:12,801
But?

231
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:19,521
But Mr Hauser seems quite accustomed
to various levels of self-mutilation.

232
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,041
I found 39 needles

233
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,321
embedded in the lower abdomen,
the perineum and the testicles.

234
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,081
I'm sorry, when you say "needles,"
what do you mean?

235
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:32,001
Needles. Household sewing needles.

236
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,121
And, er, who put them there?

237
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,241
He did.

238
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:38,401
The oldest of the needles
has been in situ for some time.

239
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,641
Years, possibly.

240
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,761
More grunt, more finesse.

241
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,801
These are absolutely the right wheels.

242
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,081
I know my wheels, man.

243
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:50,041
These are the right wheels
for the terrain.

244
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,521
What are you doing, man?

245
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:59,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

246
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,401
Shh, shh.

247
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:05,681
- Hello, boss.
- Benny,

248
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:06,841
I need you here.

249
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:10,561
I'm sorry, boss,
I think I've caught that norovirus.

250
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:14,121
I've basically been up all night
turning myself inside out.

251
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:16,841
I don't care if you've shit out
your own liver on Oxford Street.

252
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:18,641
I need you here, now.

253
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:19,841
Then I'm on my way.

254
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,561
Sorry, Minty, mate,
I'm going to have to tip.

255
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:27,961
And that's it, is it?

256
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:30,361
That's police protection
in this day and age?

257
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:33,921
Try not to drink all the milk, eh?

258
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:01,561
Jeremy Lake's office.

259
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,921
I'm afraid Mr Lake's not yet
in the office.

260
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:06,321
Can I take a message for you, Mrs Lake?

261
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,441
Stay close to Mummy, darling.

262
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:31,241
Okay.

263
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:34,721
Sorry about that.
Now, where were we last time?

264
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:42,201
- Morning.
- Morning.

265
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,841
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,681
- Morning.
- Morning.

267
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,761
-Morning, Miriam.
-Morning, Jeremy.

268
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,561
-Mrs Lake left a message for you.
-Thank you.

269
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,161
Oh, and Eleanor Cadman's
15 minutes early.

270
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,241
Ah.

271
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:07,961
Eleanor, I'm Jeremy Lake.

272
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:11,041
Has someone talked you
through the procedure?

273
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:12,641
-Er, no.
-Oh. May I?

274
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:13,801
-Yes, of course.
-Mmm.

275
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,281
Yeah, sorry.

276
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:19,041
You have a condition
known as mitral valve regurgitation.

277
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:21,681
The valve inside your heart
isn't closing properly,

278
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,001
so blood is leaking back.

279
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,481
You're a diseased whore, so today
we're going to replace the faulty valve.

280
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:30,081
Now, I'm going to make an incision
down the centre of your chest,

281
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:33,761
and then I'm going to saw through
your sternum and separate the halves.

282
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,961
Your heart is surrounded by a membrane,
called the pericardium.

283
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,481
I'm going to cut through that
and kill you,

284
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:41,721
then I'm going to make an incision into
your superior and inferior vena cava,

285
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,361
and attach a very thin tube
called a cannula.

286
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:45,761
I'm sorry,

287
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:48,521
what did you say?

288
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,561
Don't worry, I've done it 100 times.

289
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,881
Right.

290
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:04,321
I had to keep it.

291
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,401
Issues with the will.

292
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:08,681
I bet there were.

293
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,321
Typical Mum and Dad.

294
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:14,281
Didn't actually write one.

295
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,321
Did you know the observable universe
got bigger?

296
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:38,121
No, I missed that.

297
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:39,721
Well, it's true.

298
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:43,481
Last time I saw you, we assumed
there were about 200 billion galaxies.

299
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:46,761
The revised estimate
puts it at two trillion, so,

300
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:49,401
what we believed
to be absolutely everything

301
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,601
was basically just a rounding error.

302
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:55,441
Closer to zero

303
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:57,721
than the true number.

304
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:00,681
-Great.
-It's funny, really.

305
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,241
We fantasise about these things.

306
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:08,321
You become

307
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,401
enraptured with how meaningful
it will all be.

308
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:16,721
And with each repetition,
the fantasy becomes more refined,

309
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,601
until one day it's perfect.

310
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:25,881
What you'll do,

311
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:31,641
what they'll say, what words and what
precise tone of voice, the look...

312
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,041
The look in their eyes when they say it.

313
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,401
The reality can never measure up.

314
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:55,761
It was such an anticlimax.

315
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,521
I almost wished I'd never done it.

316
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:05,681
That's why meeting you is such fun.

317
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,561
You made it meaningful.

318
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:13,681
And you'll be glad I did it.

319
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,601
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
-Oh, no, don't be.

320
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,521
They were dead anyway.

321
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,761
You made me feel better.

322
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:21,481
Turned it into a sport.

323
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,321
-It wasn't that.
-Of course it was.

324
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:26,121
Not in the end.

325
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:29,161
No.

326
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,281
That's what spoiled it.

327
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,321
Is that why you left?

328
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,601
No, John, you left first.

329
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:41,681
Right.

330
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:44,281
Where is he?

331
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,201
This way.

332
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,041
Funny.

333
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,041
I was never allowed boys in here.

334
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,401
I only gave him a small sedative,

335
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:14,801
but he's still away with the fairies.

336
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:18,961
I think we have to take him back
to his dad.

337
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:22,041
Er, no, in all honesty,
I'm not sure his dad wants him.

338
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,001
Look.

339
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,361
Yeah, look, the poor boy's
an embarrassment.

340
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,721
Cornelius can't just take him back
and pretend it never happened.

341
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,321
It would weaken him.

342
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:34,561
He has to punish us
and be seen to punish us.

343
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,001
"We" are not "us".

344
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,481
Well, ask him that.
He thinks we're up a tree.

345
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:41,281
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

346
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,961
Yeah, well, I'll have to figure out
a way to make him

347
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:46,001
come out of this looking stronger.

348
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,961
Or option two,

349
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,481
we kill him and run.

350
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,721
We tried that. You got scared, remember?

351
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,201
-No, John, that's not what happened.
-Then what happened?

352
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:59,081
You left.

353
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:00,881
If that's what you think,
then you remember it wrong.

354
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:06,521
I've got to go.

355
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:08,161
More work, is it?

356
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,561
Uncuff him.

357
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:35,161
If we want to disappear...

358
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,361
I mean, really disappear...

359
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:42,441
we need to liquidate these.

360
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:23,321
...man who is targeting shoppers.

361
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,761
Why does it matter?

362
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,441
-Does it arouse you?
-No.

363
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:46,641
Do I?

364
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:49,521
Yes.

365
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,401
Well, then you're looking
in the wrong direction, John.

366
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:54,921
Some of these people
would still be alive if I was there.

367
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:21,841
How is he?

368
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:25,401
Oh, he's a bit woozy, but he'll live.

369
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:28,601
Silly sod.

370
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:32,361
Well, I appreciate the courtesy.

371
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:33,881
I told you I'd sort it.

372
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:38,161
Did you know about this, honestly?

373
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:41,081
No.

374
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:44,441
Well, she was there, wasn't she?
Last night, at your gaff?

375
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,121
Yeah, she showed up
five minutes before you did.

376
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,201
Oh.

377
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,401
So, where has she been hiding
all this time,

378
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,001
the Wicked Bitch of the West?

379
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,681
I don't know

380
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,321
-and I don't care.
-Hmm, fair enough.

381
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,641
More to the point,

382
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,441
where is she now?

383
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:04,961
Give her to me,
and you and me are all square.

384
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,361
This is about a lot more

385
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:10,881
then getting my boy back.

386
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,481
Yeah, I know what it's about, George.

387
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:14,481
That doesn't mean
we can't make it right.

388
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:16,441
How do you propose to do that?

389
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,881
Money.

390
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,721
Where'd you get all this money?

391
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,361
It's money tied into my house.

392
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:27,921
You'd really do that?

393
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,841
Give up everything you earned,
everything you've worked for?

394
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,201
Yeah.

395
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:35,921
For her?

396
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,041
Huh?

397
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:45,881
Let me get my boy back home.

398
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:49,801
I'll give you a bell.

399
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:52,801
Wakey, wakey.

400
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:02,321
We're done. You can leave.

401
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:06,801
John, tell me, what did you do?

402
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:09,401
I paid him off.

403
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:12,321
I'm sorry, what with?
You don't have any money.

404
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,641
You don't know me as well
as you think you do.

405
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,041
There's always option two.

406
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:21,441
No, this is
not my fight, this is

407
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,721
some hole you've dragged me in
and I've just dragged us out, okay?

408
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,081
So now you can go home.

409
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:29,201
- I'm not yours to...
- Alice, we're done.

410
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,161
You can go.

411
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:35,161
You're looking
in the wrong direction.

412
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,001
Well, why does it matter?

413
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:39,841
About half a million people are murdered
every year.

414
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:43,361
That's about 10,000 a week, 1,400 a day.

415
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:46,881
One per minute.

416
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:48,481
That's rounding the figures.

417
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,241
-And excluding death by...
-So0?

418
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,201
So chances are it's happening right now

419
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:54,441
in Distrito Central,
Port-au-Prince, Cape Town.

420
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:56,681
So why does this one matter more?

421
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,481
Does the pressure
of the moral circle decrease

422
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:01,121
the further you get from the centre?

423
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:05,001
Because that's
not really morality, is it?

424
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,641
That's more a kind of...

425
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:10,841
sanctimonious provincialism.

426
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:17,481
Some of these people
would still be alive if I was there.

427
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:22,241
Well, as untestable hypotheses go,
that's a doozy.

428
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,441
I just know.

429
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,841
And you don't think
this assumption of omnipotence

430
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:31,921
is a touch narcissistic?

431
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:37,081
Because I have to say,
it didn't help dear old Justin Ripley,

432
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:39,281
did it?

433
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,601
Sorry about that.
I had to drop something off.

434
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,641
Oh, yeah? What, a body?

435
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,601
-A sofa?
-A box that said "Mind your own".

436
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,201
Is there anything
that I need to know about?

437
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:20,561
No.

438
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:23,081
-Anything I need to follow up on?
-No, you're good.

439
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,881
-Anything I can help with?
-You're helping.

440
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,161
This is helping.

441
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,441
Jeremy Lake, I'm DCI John Luther,
this is DS Halliday.

442
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:34,881
What would you like,
a round of applause?

443
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,561
Wouldn't hurt.

444
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:40,921
I don't mean to be ill-mannered
but I'm due in surgery shortly, so...

445
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,321
Can we have a seat for a moment?

446
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:46,121
You have a medical condition
which requires it?

447
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:48,241
Er, no.

448
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,881
Well, then, yes, I mind.

449
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,801
Er, we're just gathering
background information, really.

450
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:56,281
Well, I'm not sure I can be much help.

451
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:58,041
At least not in that regard.

452
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,561
How much do you know
about your wife's patient,

453
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,921
James Hauser?

454
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:05,481
Before last night, nothing.

455
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:08,001
So you were unaware of the, er,

456
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,241
intense nature of their relationship?

457
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:12,641
"Intense"?

458
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:14,161
Yeah,
I think that's the right word.

459
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,561
Is it?

460
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:18,881
Vivien and I don't discuss patients.

461
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:21,921
Is there a reason for that?

462
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,201
Well, absolutely.
Acute lack of interest.

463
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,601
They're like

464
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,281
battery-hens shitting out
identical neuroses,

465
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:30,761
each of them feeling different
in exactly the same way.

466
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,641
Erm, how's Vivien feeling?

467
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,361
It must have been quite the wrench
losing somebody she became so close to.

468
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:39,401
Vivien is my wife,

469
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,201
not my chattel.

470
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:44,321
She can do whatever she chooses
with whomever she chooses.

471
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,881
Er, personally,

472
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:50,161
I very much doubt she'd risk her career
by sexually amusing herself

473
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,321
with some masturbating oddball
who got his

474
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,641
jollies by jamming pins
into his testicles

475
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,921
and threading rusty wire
down his urethra.

476
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,001
I certainly haven't noticed

477
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,881
any wounding to her buttocks or breasts,

478
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,201
which, I understand,
were his areas of particular interest.

479
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,801
Which is before he started
vivisecting them.

480
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,041
Before then, yes.

481
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:09,481
Now, if your hope in coming here

482
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,801
was to deploy vapid innuendo
and state-sponsored slut-shaming,

483
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:16,241
in an attempt to arouse my jealousy
and have me implicate my wife

484
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,321
in some imaginary wrong-doing,
then I'm afraid

485
00:37:18,681 --> 00:37:20,721
you've had rather a wasted journey.

486
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:22,801
You're looking in the wrong place.

487
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:25,921
For what?

488
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,761
Whatever you might
be looking for.

489
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:28,921
Unless I'm wrong,

490
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,321
and you just wanted to fill up
the old wank bank.

491
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,121
In which case I'm happy to oblige.

492
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,561
Would you like to know
what she likes in bed?

493
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,441
- How often? Aggressively...
- Jeremy,

494
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:41,761
we're just trying to understand
what happened last night.

495
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,001
Oh, I see.

496
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:45,161
Oh, that's easy. Er, last night,

497
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:50,281
as a result of your catastrophically
poor judgment, a man died.

498
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:53,801
And now you'd like to find a way
to hold my wife responsible.

499
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:56,481
Honestly, best of luck with that.

500
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:58,161
We'll see you in court

501
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:01,081
-if we don't see you before.
-I'm sorry, what do you mean by that?

502
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,561
I'd have thought it fairly unambiguous.

503
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:11,761
Well...

504
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:15,521
-Thanks for that.
-Ah, been a pleasure.

505
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,001
I don't know about you,
but I liked him.

506
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:24,681
Well, for someone who doesn't know
anything about James Hauser, he...

507
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,481
He seemed to know
a lot about James Hauser.

508
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:28,521
-Yeah, he did.
-Breasts, buttocks,

509
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,521
rusty old wires down
the old chap. Is that a thing?

510
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,401
No, not in my house it's not.

511
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:35,921
-So what was he looking at?
-Sorry, guv?

512
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:39,321
I mean, when we walked in,
he was holding up an MRI to the light.

513
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:41,681
Well, er, he's a surgeon.

514
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:43,321
No, he's a heart specialist.

515
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:46,721
Why was he holding up an MRI
of someone's head?

516
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,761
-Could be a number of reasons.
-Name one.

517
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:53,281
Yeah, I guess that is weird.
Am I wrong, is it weird?

518
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,481
It's weird.

519
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:56,641
So, whose head was he looking at?

520
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,041
Let's get back and find out.

521
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:39,881
Eleanor?

522
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,201
So how are we doing?

523
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:44,721
No, actually...

524
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,761
-I don't want to do this. Can we stop?
-All right,

525
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:50,161
Let's crack her open, shall we?

526
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,041
See what's inside.

527
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:12,881
We're in.

528
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:16,681
Roseanna, purse string.

529
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:19,441
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

530
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:20,881
That's all right.

531
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,081
Give Heparin, please.

532
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:34,601
Scissors.

533
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:18,681
Diane, clip.

534
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:57,281
DS Silver, I need you here now.

535
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,401
No lies, no excuses, now.

536
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:31,681
I've got to take this.

537
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:35,561
Erm, why don't you just
go on and dig into that surgeon.

538
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:36,721
He feels wrong.

539
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,641
Yeah, like a kitten kebab.

540
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:42,401
George?

541
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:45,081
Something's been needling
at me since we spoke.

542
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:46,521
Oh, okay, what's that?

543
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:48,361
Do I look like a tart to you, John?

544
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:51,241
I mean, do I look like
I learned my trade

545
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:54,001
noshing off Tory MPs in public lavs?

546
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,761
I don't follow. What?

547
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:58,241
Why would you think you could buy me?

548
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:01,481
Honestly, it's baffling.

549
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,321
George, look, whatever's happening here,

550
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:07,921
all right, just... Just stop.

551
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:11,921
All right, just pump your brakes,
take your tax, and let it go.

552
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:14,281
Otherwise it's starting...
It's gonna get out of control.

553
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,881
Whose control? Not mine.

554
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:20,401
Now, you bring her to me, John,
then we can call it square.

555
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:23,401
I can't bring her to you, she's gone.
I don't know where she's gone.

556
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,481
All right?

557
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,761
Which is what I thought
you'd most likely say. Hold on.

558
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:34,401
George, I...

559
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:47,401
George, I am warning you...

560
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:48,881
You're warning me?

561
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,641
Whatever you're thinking of doing, stop.

562
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,481
You've got a pair of spuds on you,
I'll give you that. Ha!

563
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,121
George.

564
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,761
Stop.

565
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:13,041
That woman is a debt you owe me, John.
I want her.

566
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,801
I can't do what can't be done.
She's gone.

567
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:17,481
I have no idea where she is.

568
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:21,921
O//

569
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:23,921
All right, all right, all right.

570
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:25,041
"All right," what?

571
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,481
- I'll do it.
- You'll do what?

572
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:28,561
I'll bring her to you.

573
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:29,921
You sure now?

574
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:34,281
Just stop.

575
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,961
No messing.

576
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:40,361
No amusing chit-chat.

577
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:43,521
No prevari-fucking-cation.
You get this done.

578
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:46,961
It's done. I'll bring her to you.

579
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:49,641
Oh, God!

580
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:01,121
I know how much the idea's
always excited you

581
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:03,641
to do it while everyone looks on,
but that level of risk...

582
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:04,881
There was no risk.

583
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:07,361
You were aroused, sexually.

584
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:09,841
I could see it.

585
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,641
Now, I know how difficult it is

586
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:16,401
watching the days slip by,
wanting each one to be special,

587
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,681
but you have to understand

588
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,481
that I still have a life to live.

589
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:22,601
A career you're putting at risk.

590
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,761
My liberty.

591
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:27,041
Of course, sorry.

592
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:30,201
Are you having any problems with recall?

593
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:32,121
No.

594
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:34,681
Your appetite?

595
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:36,881
Well, it's a little diminished.

596
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:40,601
No instances of pica or unusual cravings
or anything?

597
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:44,681
No. Just the usual unusual cravings.

598
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,121
I wish there was more
I could do for you.

599
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,481
No one could do more.

600
00:45:57,641 --> 00:45:58,921
I love you.

601
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:00,281
I love you, too.

602
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:13,401
Are you out tonight?

603
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:18,121
No. Straight home.

604
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:20,801
I'm tired.

605
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:29,841
I'll wait up for you.

606
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,161
Alice?

607
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:06,041
Alice?

608
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:00,401
- Penny, is it?
- Mmm.

609
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:02,321
I'm Alan, Vickie's dad.

610
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,441
-Oh, right! Hello.
-Hi.

611
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,401
Oh, is it... Is it going to fit?

612
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:08,841
Is that for the fridge?

613
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:09,921
Oh.

614
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:13,241
I don't know.

615
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:14,841
I haven't misjudged it, have I?

616
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:17,401
Anyways, she's double-parked outside,

617
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:19,361
so best crack on. Erm...

618
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:21,481
Mmm... Ninety-five, wasn't it?

619
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:24,241
-Yeah, it was.
-Er... Call it 100.

620
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:26,281
Oh, thank you.

621
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,841
-Look, yeah, you better come in and...
-Yeah.

622
00:49:28,921 --> 00:49:31,001
...see if that's going to work.

623
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:32,281
Whoop.

624
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:33,401
- You all right?
- Yeah.

625
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,001
-Right, here we are.
-Ah.

626
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:48,201
Let's just get this...

627
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:54,361
Oh! Oh, God!

628
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:38,921
Babe?

629
00:50:58,281 --> 00:50:59,641
Is someone going to get that?

630
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:06,801
Is anyone going to get that?

631
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:11,041
Apparently not.

632
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:21,601
Hello.

633
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:24,641
-Are you Alastair?
-No.

634
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:27,441
Er, George sent me. I am, er,

635
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:30,601
welcome home present.

636
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,201
Oh.

637
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:35,281
Yeah, he's right this way.

638
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:01,041
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

639
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:06,001
I think I can take it from here, hmm?

640
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:08,761
Good luck.

641
00:52:08,785 --> 00:52:16,785
