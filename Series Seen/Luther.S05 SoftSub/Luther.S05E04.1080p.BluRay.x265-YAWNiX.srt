1
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:05,441
I'm going to send you
to a series of checkpoints.

2
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,001
You won't know the final destination
until you arrive.

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:09,521
Mark isn't a part of this.

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,481
I need to know that he's walking away.

5
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:13,281
Do as I say,
he gets to go home

6
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:14,441
and watch 7he One Show.

7
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,241
And Alice?

8
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,801
Sorry.

9
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,401
You know how it is.

10
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,761
I still need to know
he's all right, I need proof.

11
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:25,881
You have my word.

12
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,321
I said I need proof.

13
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:31,361
Stay by your phone.

14
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,241
Oh...

15
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,761
Oh, yeah.

16
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,561
Yes, yes I did.

17
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,601
-Organic, yes.
-Excuse me.

18
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,441
And the kitchen rope.

19
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,881
No, no, I got Braeburns instead.

20
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,401
-Sorry, excuse me.
-About 10 minutes.

21
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:03,761
Yeah. Love you. Yes. Yeah. Love you.

22
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,361
- Sorry, excuse me?
- Bye.

23
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,161
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,041
Er, I'm afraid you dropped this.

25
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,121
That's so kind, thank you.

26
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,081
No worries. Happy to help.

27
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:56,721
# Love is like a sin, my love

28
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:03,761
# For the ones
that feel it the most

29
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:11,281
# Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

30
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,761
# She will love you like a fly

31
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:20,721
# Will never love you again #

32
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,561
Stay away from the door, he said.

33
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,401
He's not here, is he?

34
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,121
He's out there.

35
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,921
Preparing to kill John.

36
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:49,961
And then you. And then me.

37
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:54,641
If that's what he wants,
why hasn't he done it already?

38
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,601
John wouldn't come here
without proof of life.

39
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:59,721
Well, your life anyway.

40
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,961
Mine, not so much.

41
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,721
You make a good bag lady.

42
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:13,361
Thank you. Listen, we need every scrap
of insulation we can find

43
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,641
or we'll have frozen to death
by the time he gets here.

44
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,081
Don't you give me the runaround.

45
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,481
Don't you give me the runaround.

46
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,161
Guv, where are you?

47
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,201
So it turns out Jeremy Lake was keeping,

48
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,121
I don't know...
Er, I don't know what to call it

49
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,081
-a scrapbook?
-Look, Catherine, I need some help.

50
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:47,921
What sort of help?

51
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,921
I just need you to find someone
for me, all right?

52
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,561
His name's, er,

53
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,241
Ronald Massey.

54
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,961
He works for a man I need to find.

55
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:59,721
Erm, Guy, I can't just...
I mean, who is he?

56
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,961
Look, Catherine,
I'll be there as soon as I can.

57
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:05,161
I'll bring in Jeremy Lake but I need you
to do this first, okay?

58
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,521
Can you just do it?

59
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,601
- Boss, I...
- Catherine,

60
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,281
do it.

61
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:27,561
Massey. Let's see.

62
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,841
Ronald Massey.

63
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,801
The mask's
of Lake's own face,

64
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,441
which is new behaviour,
as far as we know.

65
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:25,681
But it is consistent with some
of the images in the diary.

66
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,161
His condition disinhibiting him?

67
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,881
Yeah, or maybe he knows
we're breathing down his neck

68
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:34,801
and he's decided to go
all carpe diem on us.

69
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:38,761
Do we have the faintest notion
where DCI Luther is?

70
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,201
Sorry, boss.

71
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:44,921
Catherine, do you know anything

72
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,041
I don't know?

73
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:49,281
Sorry, boss, no.

74
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:54,561
Vivien Lake knows her husband's mind.

75
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,601
She's the only one who can help us
get ahead on this.

76
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,921
Let's bring her in.

77
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,441
Well, she's being treated
at the hospital.

78
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,841
I don't care.
Wheel her in in a gurney if needs be.

79
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,441
Hey, Guv, I don't know what your
other thing is but the big boss

80
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,201
he's on his last nerve and I...

81
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,961
I don't feel comfortable lying for you.

82
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,481
And things are really kicking off here.

83
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,681
We need you.

84
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,401
Hello, I'm inquiring about
the availability of Illeana.

85
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,681
This evening.

86
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:37,521
Overnight, for preference.

87
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:42,841
Ah, good. Thank you.

88
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,921
Yes, hello, King of Plumbers,

89
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,241
I have a dreadful smell
coming from my drains.

90
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,761
Thank you.

91
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,801
Dr Lake,

92
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,721
would you follow me, please?

93
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,241
That's right, quickly now.

94
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:37,401
Boss,

95
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:38,921
we should probably go.

96
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,721
Nah, sod it. It's just a drill.

97
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,881
Well, they usually say
when it's a drill.

98
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:46,841
We'll go when the hair on your bollocks
starts to sizzle.

99
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,001
I just... Let me go and check.

100
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,081
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,281
Call him off.

102
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:33,801
We're on schedule.

103
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,681
Luther should be here soon.

104
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:38,441
Er, yeah, I actually need you
to hold off on that for a bit.

105
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,081
Why?

106
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,241
Because that's what I want.

107
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,681
We entered into a contract.

108
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,041
Er, you... You'll get your money,
just, erm, tell me where they are

109
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,081
and then, er,
take the rest of the day off.

110
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:50,681
-Go to the pictures or something.
-Come on. Come on.

111
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,841
It's not that easy.

112
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,441
A police officer is dead.

113
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,281
I can't have that coming back on me.

114
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:58,841
Ah, it... It won't come back on you.

115
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:00,761
Just text me the address and then

116
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,241
pack your sandwiches and go home.
I'll make sure everything's

117
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,401
tied off.

118
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,481
He says a copper's dead.

119
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:17,121
Yeah.

120
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,081
-That would be your mate.
-Yes.

121
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,161
Well, for what it's worth,
I didn't ask for that.

122
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:23,281
Didn't you?

123
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,401
Your mate chucked it in for free,
didn't he?

124
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,361
So where does that leave us?

125
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,441
I came to off you for Benny.

126
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,801
I'm going to end this.

127
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:09,081
All this eye for an eye bullshit,
it's all just a game, isn't it, George?

128
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:12,241
You don't want this.

129
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,521
You don't want any of it.

130
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,121
Do you?

131
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:19,161
You lost your discipline, George.

132
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:21,881
You robbed Alice, she robbed you back,
now Alice is dead.

133
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,441
That's not her fault, that's your fault.

134
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,521
Benny's dead.
That's not your fault, that's my fault.

135
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,521
I couldn't shoot you in the head
because I made a mistake.

136
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:30,401
But if you can shoot me
then go ahead and do it.

137
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:31,841
It doesn't change anything,
does it, George?

138
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,761
What I lost was my son.

139
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:37,761
George.

140
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:40,681
Take it.

141
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,361
Eye for an eye.

142
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,881
You think I won't do this
and piss on your body after?

143
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,881
Go on, George.

144
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,201
Just do it.

145
00:11:58,561 --> 00:11:59,561
Just do it.

146
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,801
Go on.

147
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,241
Stop there.

148
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,601
Do you have a gun?

149
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,321
Oh, er...

150
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:46,241
So, where is Luther?

151
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,001
He's in the boot.

152
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:51,841
Dead?

153
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,441
As a dodo's granddad.

154
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:57,721
How did you find him?

155
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,241
He came to me, as it happens.

156
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,361
And how did he find you?

157
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,281
I'm not entirely sure, to be frank.

158
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,801
But there you are.
He was a clever old sausage,

159
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,561
but not bulletproof, as it turns out.

160
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,441
- Open the boot.
- Oh, come on.

161
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:16,601
Now. If you would...

162
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,961
Open the boot.

163
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,721
All right, all right.

164
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,361
As you speak, so shall it be.

165
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:42,881
Oi!

166
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,201
I don't get it.

167
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,521
Peace In Our Time.

168
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,161
I'm Adolf, he's Neville,
you're the Sudetenland.

169
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,921
You're going to go down.
You're going to go to prison

170
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,961
for killing my friend.
Do you understand that?

171
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:07,921
And if I don't agree?

172
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,441
I shoot you dead right now
and tell a story to my boss.

173
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:23,761
No!

174
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,081
What did I tell you?

175
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,001
You're going to jail.

176
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,361
And you're going to hate...

177
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:36,601
Sorry, old bean.

178
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,241
Couldn't take the risk.

179
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,601
Here we are.

180
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,561
You, smoking gun,
damning evidence and whatnot.

181
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,401
All in the cloud.

182
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,681
Whatever that actually is.

183
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,561
Hand over the gun.

184
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:57,041
I think it's one of mine, anyway.

185
00:14:58,121 --> 00:14:59,721
You're a clever one, ain't you, George?

186
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,161
You would have been a good copper.

187
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,441
No.

188
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:06,841
Too honest to have been a copper.

189
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,441
Schenk came to me, John.

190
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,281
He knows something's
not right between me and you.

191
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:15,481
I'll settle this with Schenk.

192
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,641
He trusts me.

193
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,481
Yeah, so do I.

194
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:21,761
But only because I got this.

195
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:30,281
Alice?

196
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:38,305
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

197
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,121
Alice?

198
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:18,681
Oh, shit.

199
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,361
Shit.

200
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,521
Is your friend in there?

201
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,721
- Yeah.
- Aren't you gonna call someone?

202
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:36,841
I'll find him.

203
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,441
Well, we can't just leave him here.

204
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,521
We have to.

205
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,241
For God's sake, he's your friend!

206
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,801
Got himself killed trying to protect us.

207
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,361
Do you think I want
to be doing this, Mark?

208
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,641
Do you think I want to be doing this?

209
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,441
Benny's dead.

210
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,001
The man who killed him is dead.

211
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:13,601
What I'm trying to do is handle it
so that your name is clear.

212
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,721
What time does your wife get back?

213
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,761
Half-seven, quarter past?

214
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,121
I think we need to get back
and clean the scene.

215
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:31,921
What's happened to you, John?

216
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,641
What about
the George Cornelius problem?

217
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:05,521
Have you dealt with it?

218
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:08,481
Yeah.

219
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,641
-Let's not be coy. Is he dead, John?
-Yeah.

220
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,481
Because it's the only way.

221
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,921
He'll kill us both. You do know that?

222
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:17,001
Alice, it's done.

223
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:20,801
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, John?

224
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,281
Not about something this important.

225
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:30,481
No.

226
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,441
Because you're the only person
I ever knew

227
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,801
who always told me the truth.

228
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,521
Come what may.

229
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,641
You never lie to me.

230
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:45,361
It's done.

231
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,881
That'll be your fancy lady
calling you in for tea.

232
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,401
Oh, why don't you just give it a rest.
I've got to deal with this thing.

233
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:15,761
Deal with it, then.

234
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,601
Just go home and we'll talk later.

235
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,801
Good luck with your whatnot.

236
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,361
Hello?

237
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,241
Hello, who is this?

238
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,881
Hello...

239
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:23,801
I hope you're not too uncomfortable.

240
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:29,121
A young woman just stabbed me,
of course I'm uncomfortable.

241
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:34,481
I'm afraid that a number of doctors
have certified you fit to be questioned.

242
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:38,961
And if there's one thing we can all
agree on is, well,

243
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,441
you can always trust a doctor.

244
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:42,081
Right?

245
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,881
We know your husband
is gravely ill, Vivien.

246
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:50,961
Jeremy doesn't have long.

247
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,041
One more Christmas, perhaps.

248
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,881
But he'll never see another summer.

249
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,841
Now, if we can find and detain him,

250
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,681
his case will never get to court.

251
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:05,561
He'll never go to prison.

252
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:10,641
The worst he can expect is
a few months in a secure hospital.

253
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,521
But he will stop.

254
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:19,121
This will stop.

255
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,361
This

256
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,361
will stop.

257
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:35,801
And this.

258
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,521
It will stop.

259
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,601
I have no idea
about Jeremy's activities.

260
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:20,721
I'm as horrified as you.

261
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:24,401
Oh, I doubt if you have the capacity.

262
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,921
And to be fair, we did catch you
in a plastic-lined room

263
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:31,601
getting ready to disarticulate
Penny Leyton with surgical tools.

264
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,961
I'm afraid you've misinterpreted
that situation.

265
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,601
Actually, I was there to rescue her.

266
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,361
Get her out of there. Poor thing.

267
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:42,561
But you were wearing surgical scrubs

268
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,921
and were attacking her with a hammer.

269
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,361
I was defending myself

270
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:51,041
from a very confused
and frightened young woman.

271
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,361
Who understandably, given her
state of delirium, misread the situation

272
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:57,521
and believed, incorrectly...

273
00:22:58,321 --> 00:22:59,921
...that I was there to do her ill.

274
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,641
I have to make a call.

275
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,881
We've had some urgent news.

276
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,201
Let's hope it's the news we all want,

277
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,001
eh?

278
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:23,521
DS Halliday,
if you would hold the fort, please?

279
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,761
Where have you been?

280
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:44,041
I got called away, erm,
to something that didn't pan out, boss.

281
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:46,761
Any news from Benny?

282
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,481
No. No, he called in sick.

283
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,641
I've been called away.

284
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,521
I want you in there with Vivien Lake.

285
00:23:58,881 --> 00:23:59,961
On my way.

286
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,281
What do I need to know?

287
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:20,241
Sir, we were investigating
reported gunshots.

288
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,041
You might wanna get

289
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,481
somewhere private.

290
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:25,681
7 am somewhere private.
Go ahead.

291
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,041
We found a disposable phone
in the glovebox.

292
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,321
Call reports?

293
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:49,241
Most likely any calls were made
to another burner.

294
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:51,601
Fine.

295
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:56,081
So I will need you to determine

296
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:58,321
where that phone was last used.

297
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:01,281
See if you can find any CCTV footage

298
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:03,121
corresponding with the time and place

299
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,401
of that usage.

300
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:05,681
Absolutely.

301
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,521
You have all the resources you need,

302
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,041
but none of the time. I want this now.

303
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,321
End this.

304
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:14,761
Stays schtum.

305
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,401
Are we clear?

306
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,401
Nobody says a word.

307
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:21,841
Okay.

308
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,841
Sorry, I'm late.

309
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:49,241
I had a very busy day.

310
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:58,001
So,

311
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:01,641
where did you meet,

312
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:04,001
you and Jeremy?

313
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:07,281
Is that relevant?

314
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,161
I don't know.

315
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:17,081
We struck up a conversation at
a dinner party talking about Tony Blair

316
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,721
over baked Brie and raspberry jam.

317
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,001
That's not true.

318
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,801
You met at a play party,
basically a fetish club.

319
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,561
You really are
a bourgeois little prince, aren't you?

320
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,601
Thought police.

321
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:36,761
Sex police.

322
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,081
Erecting an edifice of speculation,

323
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:41,241
a foundation

324
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,241
for puritanical distaste.

325
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,481
No, that's not what I'm doing.

326
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:47,201
I'm basically trying to establish

327
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,921
whether you would lie
to protect your privacy,

328
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:52,881
and the answer turns out to be "yes",
which I find very interesting.

329
00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:55,561
Did you know that Jeremy

330
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,601
kept a diary?

331
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:03,521
Bit of a leap to conclude
that's a diary, isn't it?

332
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:06,081
It looks more like a sketchbook to me.

333
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,241
Okay, what about these?

334
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,481
These are actual drawings
of murder scenes

335
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:17,361
which makes me think about
these other sketches too,

336
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:20,001
which are, well, I don't know, I mean,

337
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:21,281
are these real too?

338
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:22,921
Clearly not.

339
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,081
It's an explication
of Jeremy's fantasy life. An outlet.

340
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:29,361
A masturbatory aid, nothing more.

341
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,801
Yeah, possibly, it could be.
But it's not just the drawings, is it?

342
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:36,561
I mean it's the... The text.

343
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,361
Well, that'll be, erm,

344
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,401
cipher text of Jeremy's
own construction.

345
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:45,721
Well, God knows what it says.

346
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,081
Do you think you could
decipher it for us?

347
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:48,321
Well, I'd love to.

348
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,961
But I very much doubt I'd be able.

349
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,321
You have to get rid
of this stuff properly.

350
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,281
No throwing it away in your own bin.

351
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:06,201
Oh, thank heavens I'm here with
a criminal mastermind.

352
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,201
Otherwise whatever would I have done.

353
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:09,961
I have to go, Mark.

354
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,521
I promise you won't see me again.

355
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:14,481
Well, that'll be a shame.

356
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,241
Some valedictory advice.

357
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:24,361
Don't let John Luther
back through your door.

358
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:28,401
Not under any circumstance
or for any reason.

359
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:32,521
He's not what you think he is.

360
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,681
Alice,

361
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,721
you have to stop.

362
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:47,001
Oh, God knows you are what you are,
but you're not a psychopath!

363
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,281
You're... You're not

364
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,801
without conscience.
You cannot live like this!

365
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:54,841
I know.

366
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:56,841
Do you need help?

367
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,681
Is there something I...

368
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,001
Hello?

369
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:15,841
I had a boss, once.
Her name was Rose Teller.

370
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:17,761
Really good cop.

371
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,361
She used to say, erm,

372
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:24,121
an assumption is something
you don't know you're making.

373
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,241
Do you know the assumption
you're making, Vivien?

374
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:37,001
Oh, I might be able to help answer that.

375
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:44,521
You're assuming that Jeremy doesn't want
people to read what he's written.

376
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:47,601
Then why employ a cipher text
in the first place?

377
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:51,361
Because he doesn't want you
to know what he's written.

378
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,641
He doesn't want you to know
that he's written it all down.

379
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:00,361
Everything that you've done, together.

380
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,841
Dates. Times.

381
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:05,561
Places.

382
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,521
Because that's the difference
between you and him, isn't it?

383
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,521
I mean, you are very private,

384
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,361
don't want anyone to know the truth
about you, not ever.

385
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,561
And he is very proud of what he's done.

386
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,481
He's done with being anonymous.

387
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,881
He's done with someone else
taking the credit.

388
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,241
This isn't a diary, it's a confession,
isn't it?

389
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,121
And where does that leave you?

390
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:33,881
-I don't know...
-Yes, you do!

391
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,361
You do, Vivien, don't you?

392
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,121
You know exactly

393
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,041
where that leaves you

394
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:44,801
if Jeremy has implicated you
as an accessory to murder.

395
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,601
You know exactly what that means.

396
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,961
Well, obviously he wouldn't do that.

397
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:51,441
Are you willing to bet
the rest of your life on that?

398
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:54,241
No, of course you're not.
Because he has

399
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:56,441
been letting you down recently,
hasn't he?

400
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,601
Come on, Vivien.

401
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,601
Help us and we can help you.

402
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:06,121
You are going to prison, Vivien,

403
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,601
but for how long is really up to you.

404
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:20,241
Can I have a glass of water, please?

405
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:21,921
No, you may not.

406
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:35,001
Jeremy's most outré fantasy,
and I have to stress,

407
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,961
to the best of my knowledge,
it was just a fantasy,

408
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,841
was to play a game of what he called
"Happy Families".

409
00:31:44,841 --> 00:31:47,521
To sit in a house
and summon people to him.

410
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,041
Have them turn up at the door.

411
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,441
Lambs to the slaughter.

412
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,241
Sir.

413
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:33,841
The phone was used here.

414
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:35,841
He arrives alone.

415
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,921
George Cornelius.

416
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:54,881
All right, George,

417
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,321
you wanted it old school.

418
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,881
Thanks for coming so quickly.

419
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,081
Yeah, no worries.
Erm, so what are we looking at?

420
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,521
Oh, through there.

421
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:27,121
So, Jeremy Lake's
gone to ground.

422
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:30,161
He's holed up somewhere
getting people to come to him.

423
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:31,841
How are we supposed to find him?

424
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:34,081
There are like,
60,000 streets in London.

425
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,561
And previous murders,
they don't tell us anything.

426
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,681
There... There's no pattern.
They're random.

427
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:40,521
But they're not disorganised, are they?

428
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,121
I mean, everything he's doing,

429
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:46,721
he's doing to tell himself
how clever he is.

430
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:49,641
Oh, the audacity of that. I mean,

431
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:54,161
he can take care of whoever he wants
whenever he wants.

432
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,761
He can have the police
run around in circles.

433
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:00,961
He can make the police
blame the wrong man

434
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,641
and then he's come to an end.

435
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:06,041
Which means he's gone somewhere

436
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,241
of significance, with meaning.

437
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,841
-To who?
-To us.

438
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,281
To him.

439
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,601
And if you were him, right,
where's the most

440
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,761
audacious place you could go?

441
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:21,001
If I were him, I would go home.

442
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,761
No. Too big a police presence.

443
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,841
Where's the next best equivalent?

444
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:33,041
Well, if I couldn't go to where
the police are,

445
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:35,561
I'd go to where they just left.

446
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:37,521
Left. Right, yes. Ballarat Street.

447
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:39,961
The schoolteacher. Yeah.

448
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,681
Should we tell someone?

449
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,161
No.

450
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:46,481
Not until we've checked it out.

451
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:50,081
-Are you sure?
-I am sure. Come on.

452
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:17,681
Illeana?

453
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:22,161
Wow, you look lovely.

454
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,281
Please.

455
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:36,001
# I'll be seeing you

456
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:43,321
# In all the old familiar places...

457
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:53,441
# In that small cafe

458
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:01,401
# The park across the way

459
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:07,761
# The children's carousel...

460
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,281
Move to the counter!

461
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:34,241
Do not move!

462
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,201
# In everything... #

463
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:47,881
Martin, I think it's time
maybe we discussed

464
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:49,721
getting me some legal protection?

465
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,841
I can't pull it together, George.

466
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:58,401
I've tried,
but I can't work out what happened.

467
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:03,121
I need a show of goodwill.

468
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,321
An upfront payment.

469
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,881
Right now.

470
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:38,441
Now, I told you, Martin,

471
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:41,001
your lads a wrong'un.

472
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:54,321
- Hey, Boss.
- Yes, Halliday.

473
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,801
Are you with DCI Luther?

474
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,521
Yeah, I am.

475
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,241
Now, I need you to listen

476
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:03,601
to me, very carefully.

477
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:09,361
Without alerting DCI Luther
to this order, I need you

478
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:12,601
to bring him back
to the station as soon as possible.

479
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,281
Okay, yeah.

480
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:18,081
If you alert him to this,
there is

481
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:21,921
every chance that he will run,
do you understand me?

482
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:23,281
Yep, got it.

483
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:25,481
Good.

484
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:27,921
Now, get him back to the station.

485
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,361
Tell him

486
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:35,361
I have some interesting news.

487
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,841
And I want to give him

488
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,521
it face to face.

489
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,801
Schenk has asked you to bring me
back in, hasn't he?

490
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,361
Er, yeah.

491
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:50,361
Yeah, he said that he's got some news,
something he wants to tell you.

492
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:54,561
Fair dues.

493
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:11,001
I'm not going anywhere until this

494
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:12,481
is dealt with.

495
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,161
You think he's in there?

496
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,161
-I know he is.
-How?

497
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:22,881
Plumber's van. Pest control.

498
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:25,801
Food delivery.
All people that would come to you.

499
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,521
We can get back up in nine, ten minutes.

500
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,081
We've got no evidence.

501
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,641
If we call it in, we'll have to go
through due process.

502
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:39,081
Get a warrant.
It would go on and on and on

503
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:41,041
and what does that mean
for anyone that's alive in there now?

504
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:48,001
If you found out tomorrow

505
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:51,081
that if we went in there today
you could have saved someone's life,

506
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:53,361
-would you be okay with that?
-Boss, that's not fair.

507
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,321
All right, do what you have to do.

508
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,561
Pizza delivery.

509
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:44,241
Catherine.

510
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:45,801
Get rid of him.

511
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:47,721
But what about you?

512
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:50,801
Pizza.

513
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:21,161
Catherine!

514
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:22,321
Catherine!

515
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:31,961
Stop, boss.

516
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:38,601
Boss...

517
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:48,881
What did you think? Do you like it?

518
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,041
Are you okay?

519
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,441
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:23,121
You should know, Schenk's on his way.

521
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:26,961
You called it in, didn't you?

522
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:32,961
You...

523
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:35,041
You know they're coming for me, right?

524
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:36,361
Yeah.

525
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,241
What did you do?

526
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:42,761
Nothing I can't fix.

527
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:44,641
I just need time.

528
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:48,481
Are you... Are you asking me to...

529
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:49,881
To let you go?

530
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:53,001
Catherine, I have to go, okay?

531
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:54,681
It's a mess.

532
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:58,441
But it's not what it looks like,
I promise you that.

533
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:00,761
Can I stop you from leaving?

534
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:04,441
No.

535
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:07,641
Then I won't try.

536
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:16,041
John?

537
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:22,601
Did you use me as bait in there?

538
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:29,881
Send me downstairs to lure him out?

539
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:32,321
No.

540
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,321
I think you did.

541
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:40,041
I think you dragged me here

542
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,961
and threw me in front of him

543
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:43,841
so that you could be
the man to stop him.

544
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:47,881
That is not what happened.

545
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:54,481
So what did happen?

546
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:02,161
Why are you making such a fuss?

547
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:06,601
I mean, this is what happens, isn't it,
to those of us who are no longer useful.

548
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:12,281
Who's next, hmm?

549
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,601
Could it be me, I wonder?

550
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:16,521
Well, no.

551
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:19,201
I won't let that happen, John. I can't

552
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,441
allow it.

553
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,601
She did nothing

554
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,521
to you, Alice!

555
00:46:26,841 --> 00:46:29,481
Neither did my parents, really,
or Henry Madsen.

556
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:31,641
Or Ian Reed. It never seemed to...

557
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:33,761
You never seemed to mind, really,
though, did you?

558
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:37,201
Well, what are you going
to do this time, DCI Luther?

559
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:39,881
Arrest me? Well yes, you should!

560
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:41,561
But you won't, will you?

561
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:42,881
You'll let me go.

562
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,081
Because think of the tales I could tell.

563
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:49,681
But how?

564
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:53,121
How are you going to cover
this up, I wonder?

565
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,521
What lies can you tell?

566
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:59,441
Quick, John, think of a lie.

567
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:03,681
-Come on, come on, think of a lie!
-Put it down.

568
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:05,881
Make me, liar. Liar!

569
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:07,121
Liar!

570
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:09,921
Next one's in your mouth.

571
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:12,601
Put it down, Alice.

572
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:14,321
-In a minute, liar. In a minute.
-Stop...

573
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:16,801
Oh, oops!

574
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,441
How many more bullets, Alice?

575
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:21,441
Come and see, John.

576
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:26,801
Honestly, I'm embarrassed.

577
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:33,321
I can't believe it took me so long
to see that Zoe was right about you.

578
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,121
You don't care about anyone, John.

579
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:40,761
Not unless they can feed
your compulsions.

580
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:42,761
Friends,

581
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,601
enemies, it's all the same to you.
It doesn't matter.

582
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,401
Even Zoe, you loved her so much more

583
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:50,041
-when she was dead.
-You need to stop.

584
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:52,241
It gave you an excuse to behave
exactly how you wanted.

585
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:53,361
You need help.

586
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:56,641
It's just words, isn't it, Alice?

587
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,201
Just words!

588
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:01,561
Trying to justify what you
really came here to do.

589
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:04,521
-And what's that? Please do tell me.
-Well, free yourself!

590
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:07,281
From this.

591
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:09,321
From me and you.

592
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:12,761
You keep coming back,

593
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:15,521
and coming back, and coming back,

594
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,561
but you're never going to get
what you want, Alice. Never.

595
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:22,801
- Because what I want doesn't exist.
- No.

596
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:24,601
So how many more bullets, Alice?

597
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:26,321
Yeah, well, I've got enough. Enough.

598
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:28,281
How many more?

599
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:33,601
Come on!

600
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,041
What now, John?

601
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,281
Alice Morgan,

602
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:08,241
I'm arresting you for the...
The murder of...

603
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,521
For the murder

604
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:15,001
of Sergeant Catherine Halliday.

605
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,161
Of course, you are.

606
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:22,881
You have the right to remain...

607
00:52:25,921 --> 00:52:28,281
The thing is, John,
you don't understand love.

608
00:52:28,561 --> 00:52:29,961
You can mimic it,

609
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:31,761
you can recognise it in others,

610
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:34,121
but you can never understand it.

611
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:37,361
Is this it?

612
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,601
Is this it? Love?

613
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:42,881
Yes.

614
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,161
Guess what? I lied, too.

615
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:48,441
There's one bullet left.

616
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:54,881
I just needed us to be really close.

617
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:04,641
Good night, John.

618
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:17,361
Don't.

619
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:19,881
Alice.

620
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:21,961
You need to help me.

621
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,441
No, Alice.

622
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:39,401
No.

623
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:14,281
Show me your hands!

624
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:22,681
Not like that.

625
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:16,601
# Baby you understand me now

626
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:22,521
# If sometimes you see that I'm mad

627
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:29,721
# Don't you know no one alive
can always be an angel?

628
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:35,401
# Sometimes I find myself
alone regretting

629
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:38,521
# Some little foolish thing

630
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:42,041
# Some simple thing that I've done

631
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:46,441
# Because I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good

632
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:52,961
# Oh, Lord, please don't let me be

633
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:56,281
# Misunderstood

634
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:02,961
# Don't let me be misunderstood

635
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:09,201
# I try so hard so please
don't let me be misunderstood #

636
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:17,225
