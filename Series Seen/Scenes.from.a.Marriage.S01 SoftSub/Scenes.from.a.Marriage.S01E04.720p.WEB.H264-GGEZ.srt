why it had to be today.

to vacate on the 20th.

But why did we agree
to vacate on the 20th?

116

Uh, which is exactly
what we agreed to with Jason.

117
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,125
Remember, he sent us the memo?

118
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,125
He emailed it to us last week?
Right? Okay?

119
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,375
And the only difference
is the amount we got

120
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,333
for the house, split in two,
minus the broker's fee.

121
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,875

122
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,958
Okay.

123
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,875

What am I supposed to--

124
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
JONATHAN: You'll sign by
the stickers, and then

125
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,083
-you'll initial each page.
-Right.

126
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,458
-JONATHAN: Wait,
hold on, hold on.
-No, I got it.

127
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,166
Wait, wait. We have to
look through all the items

128
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,916
and make sure everything's okay.
That's why we're doing it here.

right now, so...
-We'll do it really quickly.

quickly, then you'll sign,
and that's it. You'll be done.

for the movers, okay?

132
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,916
No, I do. I promised Ava
I would be here to put--

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,375
make sure her boxes
got on the truck.

134
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,333

anyway, right?

-Okay.
-Blue is storage.

141
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,541
So they'll pack everything up,
and, uh,

142
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,875
then they'll unload
at my place first,

143
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,791
then you guys,
then the storage facility.

144
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,791
Okay?

145
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,000
Will Poli be home?

146
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,958
Will he be able
to help you unpack?

147
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm not sure.

148
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,125
Uh-- didn't we say said that
I was gonna get the green couch?

149
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,625
Uh, actually, no, we didn't.

150
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,375
We didn't.
You said that you didn't want

151
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,666
any of the living room furniture

152
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,125
because you got all new stuff
at the tower.

153
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,041
No, I'm pretty sure we talked
about the green couch specifi--

-We didn't.
-Okay.

You wanna talk about it?

in the settlement?

It is surprising

how something so formal

it's just a piece of paper,

-MIRA: A "get"?

185

190
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,125
-MIRA: Mm.
-It's basically papers

191
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,875
that when I give them to you,
we're divorced.

192
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
-And that's it?
-JONATHAN: Yeah.

193
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,625
Yeah. But it's like--
it's a crazy,

194
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
traumatic ceremony.

195
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,750
-There's three judges.
-MIRA: Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,458
And, um,
you have to have witnesses

197
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,250
to testify that you are
who you say you are

198
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,583
and I am who I say I am.
It's humiliating.

199
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,666
-Is it gett with two Ts?
-Yeah.

200
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,875
And then you have to go
into this little room,

201
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,416
-and there's a guy in there...
-MIRA: Uh-huh.

202
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,333
...writing calligraphy
on parchment.

203
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,750
And he's writing out the text
of the gett.

204
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,375
-Yeah.
-JONATHAN: And it's--

205
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,000
it's like a thriller,
because the tiniest mistake

206
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,125
and you have to start
all over again.

207
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,625
And then, uh, and then you go
back in to the judges...

208
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,041
-MIRA: Mm-hmm.
-...and the witnesses.

209
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,791
And then I have to hand you
the gett in front of everybody

210
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,666
and yell a few sentences at you,
and then you hold it up high,

211
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,625
and you walk around the room
with it.

212
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,083
And then the judge rips it
to pieces.

213
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,458
-And there's more.
-Jesus.

214
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,875
JONATHAN: (LAUGHS)
Yeah, totally.

215

Why does it have to be
like that?

216
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,333
-Isn't it brutal enough?
-Well, I think there's a--

217
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,666
plenty of legal reasons,
but I think it just has to be

218
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,833
absolute and definitive.
That's the... you know.

-Mm.

or you're out.

there's no going back.

-There's some logic to that, no?

224
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,250

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,458

336
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,083
We're here. We're--

337
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,708
We were just having
a really good time.

338
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,875
-Yeah.
-And we're about to go
get something to eat.

339
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,708
I don't think so.
I'm not going to, okay? No.

340
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,041
-Jonathan. Hey.
-No. Mira. Mira.

341
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,791
Please, get it over with.

342
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

343
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,291
What could be more rational
than wanting to take it

344
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,791
and go over it quietly at home?
So...

345
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,583
-Mm-hmm.
-(CHUCKLES)

346
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,500
-Okay.
-Yeah?

347
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,791
Yeah. Fine.

348
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,000
Fine. That's okay.
Forget about it, okay?

349
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,583
Just take it home.
Go over it quietly with Poli.

350
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,500
He's nobody's sucker,
that's for sure, right?

351
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,666
-Just make sure, you guys
can look through it...
-Jonathan.

352
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,250
...that I haven't, you know,
fucked you over

353
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,875
in some secret clause
or something

354
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,708
that I've put in there.
Go ahead. Just take it.

355
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,625
-Don't do this.
-JONATHAN: Fucking forget it.

356
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,291
It's fine. I don't care.
It's fine.

357
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,791
I don't understand what--

358
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,166
We were just so close
to each other.

359
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,875
Yup. Exactly.

360
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,208
Just so you know, if we're
talking about renegotiating,
it's a two-way street,

361
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,333
and there's plenty of stuff
in there that I'm not
crazy about either.

362
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,833
I'm not saying
that I wanna renegotiate.
I'm just saying I wanna read it.

363
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:05,916
-Okay.
-Okay?

364
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,083
-Just saying. I'm just saying.
-MIRA: Okay.

365
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,833
Jesus.

366
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,750
By the way,
since we're talking, um,

367
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,958
you haven't paid your half
of Ava's dance classes,

368
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,291
and they're bugging me about it.

369
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,625
All right.
I'll pay you right now.

370
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,958
No. Don't pay me.
Pay them what you owe them.

371
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,458
Your half. That's how it works.

372
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,625
Right. I will pay them.
How much is it?

373
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,125
I don't know.
Check with them.

374
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,208
Okay.

375
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,458
It's 2,500 dollars.

376
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,125
-What?
-Yeah.

377
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,041
What?

378
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,333
We moved her
into the intermediate group.

379
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,000
That's twice a week,
ballet and jazz.

380
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah. I know it's twice a week.
It was my idea.

381
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,708
JONATHAN: Okay, well,
that's how much it costs.

382
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,500
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.
You asked me to take care of it.

383
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,208
You didn't think
it was a little exorbitant or...

384
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,958
If I can afford it,
Mira, you can afford it too.

385
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,208
MIRA: Okay. It's not about
whether or not I can afford it.

386
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,291
-It's just...
-Okay.

387
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,291
It's outrageous, so--

388
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,041
Well, I guess
if that's what it costs,

389
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,125
then we'll just, you know,
we'll cut her back down

390
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,458
-to once a week.
-Okay. That's fine. Go for it.

391
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,083
Tell her that she can only go
once a week

392
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,000
and she's gotta choose
between ballet and jazz.

393
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,125
I'm fine with that.

394
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,958
Can't-- can you tell her that?

395
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,583
Why should I tell her that?

396
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,666
MIRA: Because I can't--
You know why.

397
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,125
I'm-- She's furious at me.

398
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,416
I'm walking a delicate line
with her.

399
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,125
Okay. Well, you know what?
Not giving her boundaries,

400
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,708
that's not gonna make it
any better.

401
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,708
Fine. Jonathan, I know
I'm a failure as a mother,

402
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,125
-but that's not really helping.
-JONATHAN: You know what,
instead of acting like a martyr,

403
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,458
-why don't you just try...
-Oh, my God.

404
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,666
...having an honest
conversation with her?

405
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,625
-She's seven years old.
-Give me a break!

406
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,416
-She's not a toddler anymore.
-You know things are shitty
between her and I right now,

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,125
-and your lecture isn't helping.
-Well, you have to-- Okay.

408
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,041
-Will you tell her or not?
-What do you want me
to tell her?

409
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,458
That her mother ran away
with some guy one day

410
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,791
and now she has to choose
between ballet and jazz?

411
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,541
Wow.

412
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,125
I hoped I'd never hear that
again.

413
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,583
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't--
That was unnecessary.

414
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,916
I'm sorry about that.

415
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,583
(SIGHS)

416
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:22,958
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,791
(SIGHS)

418
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,833
Is that what you tell her?

419
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,791
Is that the story
you tell her about me?

420
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,083
No. No. I don't--

421
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,375
I don't talk to her about that.

422
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:41,125
I don't ever talk to her
about the separation.

423
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,333
Okay.

424
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,125
Why, do you talk to her
about it?

425
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:52,916
No.

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,375
JONATHAN: It's fucked up.

427
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,833
I mean, I don't--
like, it's hard.

428
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,916
Where do we even begin to...

429
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,333
MIRA: I know, I wish we...

430
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,375
We don't even know
what's going on.

431
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,791
We just all grow up
illiterate about it.

432
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,750
Maybe we should've been
more prepared for it.

433
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,875
It's a fact that it doesn't
always end up that way.

434
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,875
I mean, it doesn't even
usually end up that way.

435
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,375
So how do you prepare
someone for that?

436
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,625
I don't know.

437
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:39,916
I think we should teach kids
that, yeah, love ends.

438
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,125
It's, uh...

439
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,500
Yeah, relationships end
and people leave

440
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,625
and they break up
and they divorce.

441
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,458
-And that's just a part of life.
-JONATHAN: Yeah.

442
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,750
And then maybe
it just wouldn't be so painful

443
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,666
and, uh, you know,
all the suffering.

444
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,458
I think the real suffering
is the in-between.

445
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:07,666
You know, the limbo,
neither here nor there, just...

446
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,958
I think that's way harder
than a breakup.

447
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,333
That's much more traumatic

448
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,625
for the kids
and for the parents.

449
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:23,208
At least,
that's how it is for me.

450
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,291
Mira, let's get this over with,
okay?

451
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
I'll--

452
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,500
I promise you that if you find
something in the document,

453
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,750
or if there's a mistake
in the settlement,

454
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,958
I won't contest it.

455
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,083
I'll write something right now
guaranteeing you that.

456
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,541
All right?

457
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:00,208
I don't understand.
I mean, what--

458
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,166
This isn't about
the money, right?

459
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,041
So what is...

460
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,541
I got fired.

461
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,416
JONATHAN: What?

462
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,916
Or I was-- I was invited
to resign.

463
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,250
Anyway, it's-- it's over.
(CLEARS THROAT)

464
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,041
I don't understand.
What do you mean?

465
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,666
MIRA: That's what my meeting
with Ackerman today was about.

466
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,083
Oh.

467
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,541
MIRA: Yeah.

468
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,583
(SIGHS)

469
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:38,958
I mean, it was kind of obvious
something like this could happen

470
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,000
ever since I didn't take
the London job. I mean, I was...

471
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,958
You were never gonna take
the London job.

472
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,791
MIRA: No, that's--
Okay, that's not accurate.

473
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,416
-And there were various
options to that.
-Mira. No, there--

474
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,916
There was no option, so...

475
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,250
Come on. I'm not blaming you.
That's not what this is about.

476
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:56,958
It's just like, you know,

477
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,958
when I didn't take the job,
then...

478
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,500
yeah, they didn't know
what to do with me.

479
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:06,291
Couldn't relocate. I couldn't
travel because of Ava.

480
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,125
And, you know, going, uh,
back to running

481
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,708
a product management team,
it just--

482
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,375
it seemed like a demotion.

483
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,041
So they started shopping me
around the company,

484
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,541
to find me a position.

485
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,250
-Nothing clicked.
-Yeah.

486
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,708
So this morning, uh,
he asked me for a meeting,

487
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,541
which he began by saying,

488
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:31,250
"Mira, I would like to set you
free for a new adventure."

489
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,833
(LAUGHS) Asshole.

490
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,125
I'm like,
"I'm 43 and half years old.

491
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,458
I'm one-half of a single parent.

492
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,291
What kind of new adventure
do you have in mind?

493
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,500
I mean, tell me the truth.
Tell me that you're firing me

494
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,750
because I no longer live
for this company,

495
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,541
I'm not at your beck and call
120 percent of the time

496
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,500
like I used to be.
You can't ask me to,

497
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,416
you know, go out,
entertain the clients anymore

498
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,083
because I'd rather be at home
with my kid.

499
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,291
And you know what,
maybe the new, young,

500
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,250
ambitious product manager
should take them out anyway,

501
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,083
because she's much more fun."

502
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,750
I guess the weird-- I was, uh...

503
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,500
You know, I was sitting
across from him and, um,

504
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,166
I could see in his eyes,
they were just like

505
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,750
switched off, you know?

506
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,708
I was invisible to him.

507
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,583
I used to have all this power
over him.

508
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,041
I could steer him
in whatever direction

509
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:37,416
I wanted him to go,
and now I was nothing.

510
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,416
And then I realized
that I, um...

511
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,291
I've lost that power
over everything.

512
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:57,541
You know, that power that comes
from, um, being desirous.

513
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:10,125
I sat at the table and I just--
I felt so disposable

514
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:16,125
and, uh... yeah,
so I really, I felt old.

515
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,458
So, that's it.

516
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:31,958
Yeah, I'm, uh...
There's a hearing in two weeks.

517
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:36,000
I have a severance, there'll be
stock options, and...

518
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,458
But that's it. That's--
You know, it's done.

519
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,833
I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

520
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,041
(LAUGHS)

521
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:04,041
You're sorry
that happened to me?

522
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,291
JONATHAN: Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,416
Okay. You don't need
to be polite.

524
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,666
JONATHAN: No. No. I'm not.
I, uh--

525
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:21,416
But, uh, I, uh, it's...

526
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,333
MIRA: What?

527
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,208
You know, it's weird.

528
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,000
What?

529
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,250
JONATHAN: I'm just-- I'm--

530
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,250
-I'm listening to everything
that you're saying...
-Uh-huh.

531
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,958
...and it's just--
it's not, uh...

532
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,500
You're right.

533
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,708
If circumstances were different,

534
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,041
I'd be fucking losing my mind
right now.

535
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,750
I'd be telling you
I was gonna murder Ackerman

536
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:53,875
-and...
-MIRA: Mm-hmm.

537
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,083
...be going crazy
with revenge fantasies.

538
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,666
-MIRA: Right.
-Yeah.

539
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,208
And I'm listening to you
right now,

540
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,333
and I don't... I don't feel...

541
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,166
anything.

542
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,458
Oh, wow.

543
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,916
Well, congratulations.

544
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,416
-I'm sorry.
-MIRA: No.

545
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,291
I don't-- I'm not trying
to be callous. I'm not.

546
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,041
I know that you're going through
a really hard time right now,

547
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:27,791
-but you asked, and that's...
-Yeah.

548
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,666
I'm sharing how I feel.

549
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,541
Well, how you don't feel.

550
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:40,916
(JONATHAN GROANS)

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,166
Half an hour
after you were inside me.

552
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,125
-JONATHAN: Yeah. It's a--
-Yeah.

553
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,583
JONATHAN: That was--
That's the weird part.

554
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,750
(CHUCKLES) Uh-huh.

555
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,583
But, honestly,
even when we were having sex,

556
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,458
-which was great. It was.
-MIRA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

557
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,333
-It really was, right?
-Yeah.

558
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:05,625
JONATHAN: And-- there was a part
of me that was observing myself

559
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,541
from the outside, checking in
to see like how I felt,

560
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,291
how I was feeling.
What if this was the last time?

561
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,208
What if I never even
see you again?

562
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,875
-MIRA: Mm-hmm.
-How do I feel?

563
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,458
Would it be so unbearable?
And no,

564
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:20,291
I realized I could do
without it.

565
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,750
-You didn't feel that way?
-Mm-mm. No.

566
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,875
Okay, it's just like,
I think about it a lot,

567
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,208
-you know?
-MIRA: Mm-hmm.

568
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,291
Because I do--
I do think that my...

569
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:36,458
extreme dependence on you,
that that's really what ruined

570
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:41,000
everything for us beyond repair
because that paralyzed me.

571
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,208
Hmm.

572
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,041
The thought of losing you,
the fear of losing you,

573
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,625
because that would mean
losing everything.

574
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:48,041
So I'm just saying that,
like when we were in the middle

575
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,250
-of that...
-Mm-hmm.

576
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,166
...I realized that that fear
wasn't there anymore.

577
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,208
That I was free from you
at last--

578
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,791
Okay. I don't wanna--
I don't wanna hear anymore.

579
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,208
I mean, it's not really
the right time

580
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,041
for a therapy session.
You don't have to blurt out

581
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,375
-whatever pops in your head.
-Shut the fuck up.

582
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,541
Just shut up.

583
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,333
Like, what... what is this?

584
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:13,000
What is this sarcasm
and this fucking toxic shit?

585
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,583
Who are you to say
when the time is right
and when the time is wrong?

586
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,208
-Why do you get to decide that?
-While you tell me
you just fucked me

587
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,458
in order to prove yourself
that you don't love me anymore?

588
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,833
I'm trying to talk to you.
I'm trying to talk to you.

589
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,458
I'm trying to tell you something
about--

590
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,083
No. You're a fucking narcissist.
This isn't sharing.

591
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,541
This is you vomiting your stream
of consciousness all over me.

592
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,791
You don't give a fuck
how it makes me feel.

593
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,208
That is such bullshit.

594
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:36,500
I-- Mira, there--

595
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,083
I have never had an inch
of emotional space

596
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,083
-to share about my feelings
with you.
-Oh, my God.

597
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,750
If I hear one more word
of this psychobabble,

598
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,041
-I'm gonna scream. (LAUGHS)
-Well, go ahead, scream.

599
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,000
Scream. You've always been
much better at that

600
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,291
than actually communicating,

601
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,125
-than actually having
a conversation.
-MIRA: Right.

602
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,041
And you're surprised
they fired you?

603
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,833
It's a miracle they kept you
this long

604
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,250
-when you never learned...
-Shut up!

605
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,166
JONATHAN: ...how to actually
communicate.

606
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,666
I fucking hate you.

607
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,666
Wow. Okay.

608
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,625
I hate fucking you too,
so everything you said just...

609
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,458
Well, you know what,
it didn't seem like that

610
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,333
-a second ago, but...
-Oh, my God, you moron.

611
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,625
You think because you
fucked me like that one time,

612
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,000
-it suddenly makes you--
-Mira, just stop it.

613
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,916
Oh, what? Oh, sorry.
God, I said fucked.

614
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,625
I forgot I'm not allowed
to say that.

615
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,458
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, is it allowed now?

616
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,958
Am I allowed to say cock,
pussy, and cum,

617
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,458
and all those bad words

618
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,666
without you, you know,
running out of the room?

619
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,000
You are so out of touch
with my life.

620
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,333
It's actually really sad.

621
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,666
-MIRA: Oh, really?
-Yeah.

622
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,625
MIRA: So all of your religious
hang-ups are just like gone?

623
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,166
-What?
-'Cause a minute ago, you--

624
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,583
you sprinted to the shower after
'cause, you know, bodily fluids

625
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:41,958
gross you out.
So what's different?

626
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,625
It's actually none
of your business.

627
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,416
MIRA: But why?
We're sharing, right?

628
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,416
So now I'm gonna share with you
how shitty it felt

629
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,291
to pretend
like I wasn't a sexual person,

630
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,833
because for you,
I knew it would turn you off.

631
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,666
Feeling depraved every time
I wanted to fuck you

632
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,125
because for you
it was "complicated."

633
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,958
And I tried not to
take it personally.

634
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,000
I did. I said,
"Okay. It's not about me.

635
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,166
It's who you are.
It has to do with you,

636
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,666
-where you're from."
-You know what amazes me,

637
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,041
is that I actually
really bought it.

638
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,500
I believed you. I believed that
I was hopelessly screwed up.

639
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,625
MIRA: Right.

640
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,958
And I could've lived
my entire life not realizing

641
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,416
that everything
that you've despised me for...

642
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,375
Mm-hmm.

643
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,791
...everything that you hated
about me,

644
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,875
somebody else would love me
for exactly the same thing.

645
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,916
They would accept me
for exactly who I am.

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,708
Well, either they're lying
or they're very inexperienced.

647
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,958
(SCOFFS)
You're so fucking twisted.

648
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,583
You are the most twisted person
that I have ever known.

649
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,833
And not a day goes by
that I don't thank God...

650
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:35,916
-Sure.
-...that I realized

651
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
-how amazing sex can be...
-Oh, my God.

652
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,458
...and I didn't have
to waste my life.

653
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:41,833
You are the most asexual person
I ever met,

654
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:43,541
and you made a thousand
theories to justify it.

655
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,916
JONATHAN: It's true!
And you know what, it turns out

656
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,125
all I needed was a woman
who actually wanted me as I am.

657
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,791
And I had to teach you
everything about sex.

658
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,791
That's exactly right!
That's exactly the problem.

659
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,750
You taught me,
and you managed me,

660
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,333
and you told me how we would
do it and when would do it,

661
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:56,708
-and everything about it.
-MIRA: Oh, my God.

662
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,000
-That's so unreal.
-And you'd scold me.

663
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,541
You would scold me
like a fucking child.

664
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,541
You know, I think of
all the mistakes
we've made in our life.

665

for a long time now,

726

we've been having these really,
uh, vicious fights.

727
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,333
After the last time I was here,

728
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,666
he gave me an ultimatum.
He said, uh,

729
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,666
either we're having a kid or,
um, we're breaking up.

730
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,083
Well, kids, plural. It was not--
it wasn't just one.

731

And I guess I agreed.

732

Eventually, I gave in

733
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,666
and we tried for six months,
and nothing happened.

734
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,125
Then we went
to Dr. Varona, and...

735
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:48,375
she said that, uh,
I should start IVF as soon as--

736
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,458
sooner rather than later
'cause of my age.

737

And, uh...

738
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:01,166
somehow I just-- I kept delaying

739
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,291
picking up the prescription.

740
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:08,208
And, eventually, Poli,
he was like, um...

741
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,125
"You don't want this.

742
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,750
It's not happening,
and it isn't gonna happen

743
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,875
because, um,
you don't wanna have my kid...

744
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,791
'cause you'll always see me
as the guy

745
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,208
who broke up your family."

746
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:36,000

and on the first session,

747
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,291
the, um, therapist, she--
you know, she asked me

748
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,083
if I thought that, um...

749
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,458
I could ever give up on you.

750
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,541
You know, if I could, um,
accept that it was over.

751
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:05,791
I didn't say anything.
And, um, I just--

752
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,916
was just silent.

753
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,208
And in the second session,
it was obvious

754
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:12,625
that the relationship was done,

755
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:15,541
but it took Poli another week
to accept that.

756
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,333
I don't know if you care.

757
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:27,250

this is probably

758
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,750

for you to come back?

so that I could talk to you,
try to convince you.

And I heard the door slam...

812
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,625
and I wanted to kill you
all over again.

813
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,083
And somehow I found myself
right here

814
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:16,208
in the middle of this kitchen,
just like with my eyes closed

815
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,708
swaying, praying to God...

-(LAUGHS) No.
-JONATHAN: Yes. I do know that.

835
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,166
And it can be a new chapter
for you.

836
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,583
You can start a whole new life.

837
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,041
It could be a really
exciting time for you.

838
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,333
Yeah.

839
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,916
Let me tell you one thing.

840
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I have zero interest
in my new life. I mean, zero.

841
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,708
I have no curiosity about it,
and I...

842
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:46,541
I have no motivation
to start anew.

843
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,750
You're saying that
from where you are right now

844
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,916
after just getting fired
and everything that's happening.

845
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,416
No. It's not about now.
It's like all the time.

846
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,083
-JONATHAN: Yeah.
-All I want is what I--
what I used to have.

847
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,833
I don't want anything new.

848
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,125
Please. Don't. Don't. Don't.

849
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:17,333
-Why?
-Mira.

850
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:22,416
Look, you know me better than
anybody else on this planet,

851
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,750
so I'm not gonna try to hide
from you the fact

852
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,333
that I do have that urge, okay?

853
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,333
I have that urge to say,
"Fuck it. Let's just..."

854
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:30,833
-Yeah.
-"...tear up these papers.

855
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,541
Let's do it.
Let's start again," right?

856
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:37,916
I mean, I have been waiting
two years for this very moment.

857
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,208
-Right.
-But I have to fight it.

858
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,958
-We both have to fight it.
-No, we don't.

859
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:45,000
Yes, we do, because
it's never going to work.

860
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,625
I'm not in that place anymore,
and you're not in that place.

861
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,166
But, but we can find
our way back,

862
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,750
I think that's
what we're doing right now.

863
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,166
No, that's not
what we're doing.

864
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,125
Look, just because there's
this thing that happens

865
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,833
whenever we see each other,
that doesn't mean anything.

-It's a mirage.
-No, no.

867
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:02,375
And I know
that after a day passed,
after the excitement passes,

868
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,458
we would look at each other
and we'd think,

869
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,083
-"What the fuck did we do?"
-No.

870
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:08,125
We can't live
in the same house together.

it came up, actually,

that having another kid
was more important to me

00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:58,375
than having another partner.

Her and her girlfriend
just split up and, uh...

941
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,583
Well, it came up
that she was in the process

942
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,166
of looking for a partner,

943
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,291
a man, for, um...

944
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,708
What's it called? Um...

00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,625
Elective co-parenting,
which-- yeah.

946
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,833
And kind of
as a joke, she was like,

947
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,000
"You'd be perfect.
What about you?"

948
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,416
So you're gonna have a kid
with Celia Patterson?

00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,041
JONATHAN: I don't know. Maybe.

950
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,333
I mean, not necessarily her.

951
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,416
But it's a--
it's a cleaner situation

952
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,166
to go into that arrangement

we made a mistake back then.

we could handle it,

could survive another kid.

-What I'm trying to do is see

988

if there's a way to undo
this paradigm

to having a romantic partner

990

to think about...

okay?

you can't drop a bomb like that

1016
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:51,708
and just leave.
