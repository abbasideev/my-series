00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,450
-Mm-hmm.
-DANIELLE: And how did you meet?

170
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,240
-You should be the one
to tell the story.
-No.

171
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,990
It's way more entertaining.
Come on.

172
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,070
(SIGHS)

173
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,450
Is-- Can you tell me
how this is part of the study?

174
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,530
DANIELLE:
Um, well, it's valuable

175
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,410
in the context
of the gender perceptions

176
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,990
you had at the beginning
of the relationship.

177
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,070
Okay. I just-- I've...

178
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I was under the impression
that this is gonna be

179
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,320
more like multiple choice.

180
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,610
DANIELLE: Sorry, no.

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,490
Okay.

182
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,530
I'll tell it. It's actually--
It's a good story.

183
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,910
-And, uh...
-Mm-hmm.

184
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,990
You can just interject
when I get melodramatic.

185
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,160
Sure.

186
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,240
So, we met at Columbia.

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
Um, we went there,
we were in a seminar together,

188
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,740
English lit.

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,320
So, um, we spent three hours
a week in a tiny little room,

190
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,280
uh, but at this point,
there was no way

191
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,070
-that we would have ever...
-No.

192
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,700
I should mention that I was
still Orthodox at the time.

193
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,530
-DANIELLE: Oh?
-Yeah. Yes.

194
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,780
I, uh, I grew up
in a Modern Orthodox

195
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,160
-Jewish family.
-Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,450
So up until that point,
up until college, my education

197
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,780
had been mostly single-sex,
I'd never touched a woman.

198
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,110
So the whole thing
was pretty overwhelming,

199
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,950
um, me with my black yarmulke
and white button-down shirts,

200
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,610
and all these young women
in their little tank tops.

201
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,410
And Mira specifically
was like a campus celebrity.

202
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,610
She was dating a member
of a big rock band at the time,

203
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,280
that needless to say
I'd never heard of.

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,450
No, they were--
they weren't really rock,

205
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,660
and they weren't big.

206
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,820
You've probably heard of them,
Saraband? Lucas McRae?

207
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,280
-Oh, wow.
-JONATHAN: Uh, yeah.

208
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,780
I just thought-- I thought
of Mira as kind of a...

209
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,280
-A what?
-No, no, no.

210
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,450
-No. Tell me. I wanna--
-Yeah, it-- it--

211
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,410
it's just that you were
as far away from my world

212
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,450
as it-- as it got, you know.

213
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,490
And anyway, I was already
engaged to a girl

214
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,070
that I grew up with
near Long Island.

215
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,820
-DANIELLE: Oh.
-Yeah.

216
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,320
-So how did it happen?
-JONATHAN: (CHUCKLES)
Uh, well, she just...

217
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,700
just walked up to me one day
and, um...

218
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,740
This part you should tell.

219
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,820
Um, okay. So I was in a, um...

220
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,240
a theater group in school,

221
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,950
and we were doing this one play
by Bashevis Singer, and--

222
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,160
An adaptation of
Enemies, A Love Story.

223
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,490
-Hmm.
-MIRA: Right.

224
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,070
And, um, so I was doing all
this research on Orthodox Jews.

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,490
I was very serious about acting
in college.

226
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,490
-Oh, yeah.
-And so I just went up to him

227
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,700
one day after class, and I asked
if I could talk to him,

228
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,740
-and he just-- he seemed
completely horrified--
-I was, yeah, paralyzed.

229
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,530
MIRA: Yeah. But I was
very committed to this role.

230
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,570
JONATHAN: Absolutely.

231
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,700
So committed
that she got completely naked

232
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,910
-halfway through the play.
-MIRA: No! Not completely.

233
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,910
And I'd already started
the process

234
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,780
of, uh, leaving my religion.

235
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,950
But, uh, no, that-- that--

236
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,740
that show was
definitely a milestone.

237
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,410
Mm. You mean
you actually started dating?

238
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,740
MIRA: Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not until years later.

239
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,570
JONATHAN: Yeah. Yeah,
I was already here in Boston,

240
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,200
and I was, uh,

241
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,240
...creeping around
on her Myspace page,

242
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,660
and I saw
that she was moving here

243
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,200
and that she was looking
for an apartment share.

244
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,860
So we became roommates.

245
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
And from there, it progressed.

246
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,660
DANIELLE:
And who initiated that?

247
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,110
JONATHAN:
I think it was both of us?

248
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,990
-Yeah.
-Right?

249
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,780
Yeah.

250
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,780
-Both.
-(CHUCKLES)

251
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,110
I had just come out of a series
of relationships

252
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
which were...

253
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,410
borderline abusive.

254
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,990
And I guess
that I was addicted to that,

255
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,200
and I-- and I was...

256
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,700
stuck.

257
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,160
Uh, I had a job that I could
care less about.

258
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,910
DANIELLE: Mm.

259
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,740
And Jonathan
was the complete opposite.

260
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,910
Uh, he was everything
that I wanted to be.

261
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,320
He had values, and purpose.

262
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,200
-It's true.
-Yeah, well. Yeah, I...

263
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
It's ironic because this was

264
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,530
at the height of my
existential dread.

265
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,360
After I left my religion,

266
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,360
I just had these years
of loneliness and... (CHUCKLES)

267
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,860
So... when did it happen?

268
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,570
MIRA: Well, it happened...

269
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,450
-thanks to the asthma, actually.
-(CHUCKLES)

270
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,820
DANIELLE: The asthma?

271
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,860
Yeah. There was this one time
we were coming back from the ER,

272
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,990
I'd had a very severe attack,
and the, um, the doctor...

273
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,110
(CLEARS THROAT)

274
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,450
...he mistook us
for a married couple,

275
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,410
and, uh... we liked it,

276
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,280
and we came home
and we kept playing at it.

277
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,530
And, um...

278
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,990
and then it happened.

279
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,030
DANIELLE: That's great.
That's perfect.

280
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,160
So... All right.

281
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,320
-Now, I'd like to hear...
-(WHISPERING) It's almost over.

282
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,910
...a bit about, in your opinion,

283
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,570
what is the primary factor

284
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,610
contributing to the success
of your marriage?

285
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,610
-Hmm.
-(CHUCKLES)

286
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,860
-Hmm.
-I-- I'll let you take this.

287
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,860
Interesting.
(CHUCKLES) Interesting.

288
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,700
Could you actually tell us what
the definition of success is

289
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,110
that you're working with?

290
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,160
Yeah. Well, uh, first of all,

291
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
it means that
you're still together.

292
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,860
-Uh--
-That's a low bar.

293
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,530
(LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,610
Well, does our ten years
make us statistical outliers?

295
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,570
-DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

296
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,610
DANIELLE: Well, if we ignore
all the socioeconomic

297
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,820
and race parameters, then yes.

298
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,610
The average marriage in the US
is 8.2 years.

299
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,200
JONATHAN: Okay. Well then

300
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,740
shouldn't you ask first
if subjectively that--

301
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,950
if we perceive our marriage
to be a success at all?

302
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,030
DANIELLE: Well, um, sure.
Yeah, if you can--

303
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,240
JONATHAN: Yeah, I'm only saying
that because I feel like

304
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,700
that word, "success,"

305
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,570
is kind of emblematic
of a larger

306
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
cultural misconception
about marriage.

307
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,570
DANIELLE: Hmm.

308
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,450
-Yeah.
-It's become this project,
right?

309
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,200
This thing that you work on,
"We're working on our marriage."

310
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,410
-It's this...
-MIRA: Mm.

311
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,570
...multibillion-dollar industry.

312
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,160
There's, you know,
self-help books,

313
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,740
-and couples therapy...
-DANIELLE: Right.

314
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,740
-...and workshops, and podcasts,

315
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,280
and apps, and TV shows.

316
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,740
It's a huge business.

317
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,160
DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.
And you see that as a problem?

318
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,700
Look, maybe it's because
of my background,

319
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,200
but I just think
it's so obvious that-- that--

320
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,490
Western culture,
consumer culture,

321
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,410
has very purposefully created

322
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,450
these completely
irrational expectations

323
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,450
that marriage must,
at all times, be based

324
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,780
on passion, on sex,

325
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,570
on relentless
emotional intensity,

326
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,240
when it's so obvious that
these things stem from novelty,

327
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,530
so the whole concept's
a complete fallacy.

328
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,610
-DANIELLE: Right. Okay.
-Mm.

329
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,990
DANIELLE: So then,
well, what is--

330
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,240
what's your concept?

331
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:59,200
I think-- I think we both see
marriage as a means.

332
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,660
It's not an end.

333
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,070
Right? I think we see it
as a platform...

334
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,860
-Mm-hmm.
-...where we both can, uh...

335
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,200
that allows us to develop
as individuals.

336
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,160
We're both really passionate
about the work we do, and...

337
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,610
and our partnership gives us

338
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,070
the safe ground to do it,
and to...

339
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,070
raise a daughter
and have a family.

340
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,530
Yeah.

341
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,240
Mira, what about you?

342
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,490
Um, sorry, what was the...

343
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,700
DANIELLE: The question was about
your perception--

344
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,990
Right. Our success. (LAUGHS)

345
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,660
Um, well, I agree with what
Jonathan said.

346
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,410
-I mean, we-- we come--
-(FOOTSTEPS)

347
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,450
-Hi.
-Hey, honey.

348
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,450
-Hey, oh. What is it?
-Whoa!

349
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,200
-Hi.
-DANIELLE: Hi.

350
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
-I'm Danielle. Remember me?
-Who's that?

351
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,780
-What's wrong, honey bunny?
-It's over.

352
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,990
Oh. Okay.

353
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,530
-Sorry, give us a second.
-DANIELLE: Of course.

354
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,200
Come on. I'll put another one
on for you, okay?

355
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,410
-DANIELLE: Take your time,
no worries.
-AVA: Why can't I watch it

356
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,530
here with you on the iPad?

357
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,950
-We'll be right back.
-Because, silly goose,

358
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,030
we're having a little meeting,
but then-- It's okay.

359
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,570
I'm just-- I'm gonna stay
with her and watch.

360
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,110
I got it, I got it.
I got it, sweetie.

361
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
-No, I'm gonna--
-You're in the middle
of your answer.

362
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah, but I'm dying to get this
over with. Come on. I'm--

363
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,160
I know, but it's just
gonna be a little longer.

364
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,990
-She said an hour at the most.
-AVA LEVY: Daddy.

365
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,410
Okay, sweetie,
I'm gonna put it on.

366
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,610
What's wrong?

367
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,570
Nothing.

368
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,740
Have fun.

369
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,660
JONATHAN: Okay.
Just one second, patience.

370
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,820
-Sorry about that.
-No, no, it's fine.

371
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,240
-I know exactly how it is.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

372
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,450
I'm so grateful
to you both for doing this.

373
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,490
It's so hard finding subjects
for research,

374
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,110
especially straight men,
actually.

375
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,610
Well, lucky for you,
Jonathan loves

376
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,070
-talking about his theories.
-Hmm.

377
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,450
Well, what's yours?

378
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,990
Well, um...

379
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,030
I think about it in terms of...

380
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,030
an equilibrium.

381
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,320
-DANIELLE: Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. I think that

382
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,700
in marriage, there is
this very delicate equilibrium

383
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,200
and that, um, you have to
maintain it together.

384
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,660
DANIELLE: And what
do you mean by equilibrium?

385
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,490
Well, you know, at the beginning
of a relationship,

386
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,160
everything's thrilling
and it's new

387
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,280
and you feel as a couple
that nothing can hurt you.

388
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,530
Right.

389
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,950
And then you gradually
start to realize that actually,

390
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,160
anything can hurt you.

391
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,240
-Mm-hmm.
-(IPAD PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

392
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,700
Uh...

393
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,860
-I'm gonna go check on them.
-DANIELLE: Okay.

394
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,820
-I'll be right back.
-DANIELLE: Sure.

395
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,110
-MIRA: Hey.
-Good? Yeah.

396
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,740
Sorry, the Wi-Fi was,
uh, messed up.

397
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,160
It wasn't loading.

398
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,070
Hi.

399
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,780
We have another half an hour
while she watches this one.

400
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,780
-Perfect.
-Okay. All right.

401
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,030
Okay. Great.

402
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,740
Thank you.

403
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,700
So...

404
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,490
Yes, I'd like to hear about
your attitudes towards monogamy.

405
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,660
Um, to what extent do you see
yourselves committed

406
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,160
to each other exclusively?

407
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,860
Well, what do you mean?

408
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,070
DANIELLE: I mean sexually.

409
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
(LAUGHTER)

410
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,240
JONATHAN: I would say
it was very unexpected.

411
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,450
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

412
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,360
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

413
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,110
Well? What did I miss?

414
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,410
-MIRA: Oh, God.
-KATE: Basically, she asked

415
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,990
if they're fucking other people.

416
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,110
-That's a little intrusive, no?
-Yeah.

417
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,820
-KATE: Why?
-Well, maybe not for you,

418
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,570
but how did you agree
to do this?

419
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,110
I didn't. Jonathan agreed,
and he dragged me into it.

420
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
JONATHAN:
I didn't drag you into it.

421
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,530
-You did. Yes.
-No, I didn't.

422
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,030
MIRA: You did. He met her
at Ava's preschool.

423
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,360
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

424
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,160
For the twins, she takes care
of the twins that go there.

425
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,950
So she told him all about it,

426
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,910
and he couldn't help advancing
his theories

427
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,490
on how capitalism
ruins marriages.

428
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,700
-(LAUGHTER)
-JONATHAN: It's true.

429
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,360
-Jonathan.
-Word needs to get out.

430
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,610
Getting friendly with
the younger women at pickup?

431
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,160
-JONATHAN: Come on.
-Uh-huh.

432
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,110
-MIRA: That is true.
-He's taking advantage
of his sexy dad factor.

433
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,820
She's a student.
She's a student. Please.

434
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,110
PETER: But, wait,
what is the research about?

435
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,700
JONATHAN: I'm kidding.
I'm totally kidding.

436
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,320
I think that-- I think

437
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,820
her thesis is basically that

438
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,030
when the woman
is the primary provider

439
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,820
and the man
is the primary caregiver,

440
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,660
the marriage has
a greater chance of "success."

441
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,030
-KATE: Mm.
-PETER: Really?

442
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,280
JONATHAN: Yeah.

443
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,410
Apparently, there's research
that says that the woman's

444
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,070
level of satisfaction
is the crucial element

445
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,660
in determining the long-term
stability of a marriage.

446
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,410
PETER: Huh. You hear that, Kate?

447
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,320
-Loud and clear.
-(LAUGHTER)

448
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,450
PETER: Anyway,
why is she choosing

449
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,070
to follow long-term
monogamous couples?

450
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,410
I would expect more out of
a millennial psych student.

451
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,530
-(KATE AND MIRA WHISPERING)
-JONATHAN: Yeah, apparently, uh,

452
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,320
divorce has been researched
to death, so...

453
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,570
Yeah, but there's so many
other relationship models.

454
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,820
I mean, it's a new era.

455

-(WOMEN WHISPER, LAUGH)
-PETER: Take us, for example.

456
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,660
-She should have met with us.
-Yeah. Well, you know, I'm happy
to give her your number, Peter,

457
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,820
if you're interested, as she's
desperate for research subjects.

458
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,950
By all means. I think she could
benefit a lot from us.

459
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,240
Wait. But she's interested in
successful marriages.

460
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,070
I think that rules us out, baby.

461
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,450
-That's...
-(KATE LAUGHS)

462
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,070
I don't think that's true.

463
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,160
Okay. Hey. I'm sorry.

464
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,450
Wait. So how was,
uh, how was Boulder?

465
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,780
-Oh, yeah.
-PETER: It was good.

466
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,240
We-- we won the pitch.

467
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,530
-Hey, that's great.
-No!

468
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,570
-Cheers. Congrats. Fantastic.
-KATE: Thank you, guys.

469
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,410
PETER:
Yeah, actually, we killed it.

470
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,780
You know, I don't think
they were, uh,

471
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,780
looking for a boutique company,

472
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,160
but they fell in love
with Kate's demos.

473
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,570
Of course they did.
She's a genius.

474

There's no better web designer
on the entire East Coast.

475
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,950
-No.
-MIRA: I've said that

476
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,360
-multiple times.
-PETER: No argument here.

477
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,280
And, you know, I didn't fuck up
the presentation too badly, so.

478
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
-Well, good. Good on you.
-You sure? You sure?

479
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280

That's great, guys.
I'm jealous of you.

482
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,610
I am. I get jealous of them.
I just think that, like,

483
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,660
a couple that can
work together is--

484
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,030
Don't be too jealous.

485
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,570
JONATHAN: No, I'm sure it's not
always easy, but when it works,

486
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,660
-that's like the paradigm.
-Easy? I mean, the fact that

487
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,360
we got through Boulder without
killing each other is a miracle.

488
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,280
Let's not do this now, Kate.

489

-KATE: Why not?
What's the problem?
-This is not the time for it.

490
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,660
Okay. So, when we're alone,
it's not the time either.

491
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,990
Maybe you can give some thought
to when the right time might be.

-Don't leave.

-What's going on, Peter?
-It's nothing important,

drama about...

and I'm extremely depressed
about it.

504
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,110
Peter can't deal with it.
He won't talk about it.

505
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,700
So that's what's going on. And--

506
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,530
-PETER: Kate. Cut it out.
-Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

507
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,780
Cut it out?
You cut it out. All of these--

508
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm so sick of this
social fascism.

509
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,780
-Social fascism.
-KATE: All these bullshit
empty conversations.

510
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,410
I'm allowed
to talk about everything

511
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,240
but the most important thing
going on in my life.

512
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,780
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

513
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,410
PETER: Maybe they don't really
feel like hearing about it,

514
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,160
-have you considered that?
-KATE: No, no.

515
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,610
You're the only one that doesn't
wanna hear about it.

516
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,740
Because you'd rather wallow
in your passive-aggressive
bullshit resentment,

517
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,820
you can't
admit that you're hurting,

518
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,280
that it hurts,

519
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,570
-and just talk to me about it.
-Yeah, I'm hurt, okay?

520
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm very hurt. I admit it. Okay.

521
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,780
-Can we end this now?
-Okay. No, we can't end this.

522
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,200
And I won't live like this.
Okay?

523
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,280
When we started this, we said

524
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,910
that we would talk about
everything, and I was there

525
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,200
through all your shit
with Alana, Grace.

526
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,570
I accepted that.
I dealt with that.

527
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,780
And now suddenly
when I'm the one that's going
through something,

528
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,910
it's like
my feelings aren't legitimate.

529
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,610
I never fell in love
with anyone else.

530
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,860
That's the difference.

531
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,660
KATE: Okay.

532
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,160
So what if I... fell in love?

533
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,530
That was supposed to be a part
of the risk we both accepted.

534
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm not leaving, I'm here,
I'm dealing with it.

535
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,280
-Sorry.
-It's okay. No, no, no.

536
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,910
-Oh, God.
-JONATHAN: It's all right.

537
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,320
So you care more about
what they think about you

538
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,160
than what I'm going through
right now.

539
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,200
-You're so pathetic.
-I think it's a real competition

540
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,490
as to who's most pathetic
right now.

541
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,910
MIRA: Let's take a break.
I'm gonna go upstairs.

542
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,700
Why don't you come upstairs
with me?

543
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,740
I'm gonna call a car.
You do whatever you want.

544
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,160
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

545
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,570
-No, no.
-I couldn't hold it
together anymore.

546
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,450
-MIRA: I get it.
-That whole dinner,
he was just...

547
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,030
I know.

548
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,160
It's been like this all week
since I talked to you.

549
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,200
MIRA: I'm sorry
I haven't been here.

550
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,700
-When did your flight get in?
-MIRA: Last night.

551
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Do you have an Advil?
My head's killing me.

552
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,110
In my bathroom. I'm just gonna
check on Ava for a second.

553
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,360
I'll be right there.

554
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,950
(PETER AND JONATHAN
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

555
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,700
PETER:
Revisionist history, you know?

556
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,610
She was a mess,
I was holding things together.

557
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,360
(SCOFFS)

558
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,780
-Did you find it?
-Yeah.

559
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,030
So, it ended with Nathan,
completely?

560
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,410
Yeah. For good.

561
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,030
-I'm sorry.
-(CHUCKLES)

562
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,070
Oh, girl. Yeah.
He said he's exhausted

563
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,360
from living a double life.

564
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,360
The irony is a double life's
the only life

565
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,780
I know how to live.

566
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,530
Right.

567
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,860
KATE: Mira, this past week,
I can barely get out of bed.

568
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,030
Literally.
It's not getting any better.

569
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,360
And Peter just sulks all day
like a child. And...

570
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,860
(SIGHS) When he's not doing
this phony chipper thing

571
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,660
that makes me
wanna strangle him.

572
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,160
And then I have these outbursts
of hatred for him

573
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,570
where I'm just...

574
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,280
I find myself in bed...

575
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,320
thinking of the craziest ways
to torture him

576
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,990
and then fucking kill him.

577
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,950
-I don't know.
-Mm-hmm.

578
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:08,240
Perhaps it's time to reconsider
this arrangement.

579
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,450
This arrangement?

580
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,490
(EXHALES) I'm--

581
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,410
You gotta remember
this whole thing started

582
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,450
so Peter could justify
his cheating.

583
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,740
This is just-- It doesn't matter
how it started.

584
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,070
This is the way that we found
to, you know, get through it,

585
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,780
and I don't regret it.

586
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,450
MIRA: Mm.

587
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
KATE: I don't.

588
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,950
-I don't-- Kate.
-KATE: It's been good for us.

589
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,320
I don't remember ever wanting
to fuck Peter

590
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,820
as much as
when I was with Nathan.

591
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,950
I'm serious. I wore him out.

592
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,820
-MIRA: Okay.
-Do you know how good it felt

593
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,320
to actually want my husband?

594
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,110
You know, this is real.

595
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,700
This is my life, Mira.
It's not some whim.

596
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,530
I mean, what I had with Nathan,

597
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,240
I don't remember
ever feeling so alive.

598
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,280
And so, okay, it also means
feeling this terrible pain.

599
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,700
It's part of the deal.

600
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,860
You're really
suffering though, honey.

601
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,860
Hmm.

602
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,030
What would be better?

603
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,490
There were at least three years

604
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,570
when I didn't have sex
with Peter.

605
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,070
-MIRA: I know.
-Yeah.

606
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Does that seem
reasonable to you?

607
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,820
Life without any passion,
right? Kind of like--

608
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,700
Well, passion, okay,
it's awesome,

609
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,990
uh, but, you know,
it's not sustainable.

610
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,450
We're not 16 anymore.
You can't--

611
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,820
What does 16
have to do with anything?

612
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,450
Did you renounce passion
at the age of 16?

613
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,280
No, I'm not saying
that I renounced it.

614
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,950
KATE: Don't start quoting
Jonathan's theories

615
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,570
-about marriage.
-I'm not quoting him.

616
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,410
No, I-- I'm saying that, okay,
this open relationship

617
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,990
-comes at a price for everybody.
-Of course it does.

618
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,280
And... it can't be easy
for your kids, right?

619
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,200
Well, it's not easy
for any kid, Mira.

620
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,490
I mean...

621
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,490
Honestly, in the long run,
I think that it's actually...

622
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,990
very empowering for them

623
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,070
to see me always searching
for freedom and happiness.

624
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,610
I don't know,
self-actualization?

625
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,490
It's absolutely something
that I want to model for them.

626
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,780
Especially Anna.

627
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,160
Okay.

628
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm not judging you, honey.
I'm not.

629
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Yeah.

630
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,700
MIRA: And I'm on your side
always. You know that, right?

631
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,160
I know. I do.

632
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,410
I'm sorry. Here.

633
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,110
-Mm.
-KATE: No, no, no.

634
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,320
(KATE EXHALES SHAKILY)

635
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,610
KATE: Hmm.

636
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,990
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

637
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,820
Oh, this day. It's just, like,
it's so much. It's...

638
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,660
Wait, is something wrong?

639
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,990
No, it's just, uh...

640
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,280
It's just a lot of pressure, so.

641
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,700
What kind of pressure?

642
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,030
No, it's nothing. Forget it.

643
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,700
(LAUGHS) What?

644
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,660
Nothing, I just--
I'm sorry I lost it.

645
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,070
(LAUGHS)

646
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,740
I think it's okay.
That was crazy.

647
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
KATE: Girl.

648
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,700
-You're such a good friend. Hey.
-Aw.

649
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,740
And you're stunning.

650
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,240
KATE: I don't... (LAUGHS)

651
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,660
-Not sure where what came from.
-(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

652
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,410
KATE: I think I'm pretty drunk.

653
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,410
MIRA: Um...

654
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,610
-KATE: Okay. You good?
-Yeah.

655
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,070
-Do you wanna go downstairs?
-Okay.

656
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,030
-Mm. Yeah.
-(MIRA LAUGHS)

657
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,660
KATE: Hang on.

658
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,070
-Okay, come on.
-KATE: Okay.

659
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,410
(EXHALES)

660
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,820
PETER: Oh, no, no, no,
you got it backwards.

661
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,070
It was-- it was-- it was she
who made the sale.

662
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,320
JONATHAN: I get that, but you
did your fair share of the work.

663
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,780
PETER: She is a ball buster.

664
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,530
-She can be
really fucking scary.
-MIRA: Oh my God.

665
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,740
PETER: And she's a--
she's a true artist, right?

666
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,530
-I'll call a car.
-PETER: She's a certifiable
genius. She's gorgeous.

667
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,110
I'm just gonna clean up a bit.

668
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,490
PETER: I don't know why she even
ever let me between her legs,

669
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,320

671
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,160
at 206 Abbottsford Road
in Brookline.

672
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,030
PETER: When I sleep with
other women, it's because, uh,

673
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,490
it's only because
it makes me feel...

674
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,200
You know, it's--
it has nothing to do

675
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,360
with falling in love.
It's the only way--

676
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,070
It's the only way
that I can, uh...

677
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,320
JONATHAN: No, it does--

678
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,910
PETER: You know, I know--
I know I'm the one who--

679
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,240
Peter, I called us a car.
Neither one of us can drive.

680
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,200
-PETER: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-JONATHAN: Do you want coffee
or anything?

681
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,240
-KATE: Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

682
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,030
Yeah, I was just, uh...

683
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,740
I was just trying
to explain to him

684
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,110
how you and I decided to, uh...

685
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,610
And I, you know, I was saying
that just ignoring the fact

686
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,360
that you have options
doesn't make them go away.

687
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,530
-Right? Right?
-KATE: Yeah.

688
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,610
PETER: You know, or another way
of saying it is,

689
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,240
you know, if the only reason
that you're faithful

690
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,070
is because it's like
a rational decision,

691
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,280
-well, that's not sustainable.
-Why not?

692
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,490
Well, because it's just a matter
of the right woman, right time

693
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,490
-when it finally happens, right?
-JONATHAN: Oh, okay.

694
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,410
So I don't have a choice
in the matter?

695
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,740
PETER: No, you don't.

696
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820

702

No, tell me, I wanna hear.

707
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,950
I think maybe it's just because
of the way that I was raised.

708
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,610
-PETER: What do you mean?
-Well, you know, in...

709
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,950
the first 20 years of your life,

710
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,110
you're taught to conquer
your desires,

711
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,240
-not surrender to them.
-Dude.

-That's grotesque.

that level of repression,

that it's ingrained in me.

to start shaking that off.

JONATHAN: And you
immediately got pregnant.

845
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,740
So is it possible that
there's a part of you that--

846
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,110
wanted this or thought
that we should have this?

847
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,740
Where is this coming from?

848
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,410
-It's so...
-JONATHAN: I know, I know.

849
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,240
I mean, if you're--
if you're trying to say

850
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,490
that you want
to keep it, just say that.

851
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,820

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,450

853
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,320
I-- It's what we talked
about originally.

854
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,910
Yeah. But originally,
it was completely abstract.

855
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,490
I mean, it was...

856
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,240
before we knew anything
about anything,

857
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
it was before Ava,

858
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,610
before we knew
what it was actually like.

859
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,570

00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,660
You...

861
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,110
-You wanna keep it, right?
-I think so. Yeah, I think so.

862
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,240
I think we can handle it,
but only if it's something

863
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,740
that you really, really want
and would be happy about.

864
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,070
I think so.

That's why you become distant,
and I hated you

913

for being distant, and I hated
myself even more for...

As I said, you'll take
