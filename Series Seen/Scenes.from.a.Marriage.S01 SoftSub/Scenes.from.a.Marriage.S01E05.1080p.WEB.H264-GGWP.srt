1
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,875
Thirty days ago,
our world shattered.

2
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:33,208
Our beloved father left us
to the world of truth.

3
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,416
The Gemara teaches
in maseches shabbos

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,458
that only 30 days
after the passing,

5
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,333
as long as flesh remains
on the body,

6
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,958
anything said to the niftar

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,125
will be heard by him

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,041
until his fate is sealed.

9
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,000
So today, on the thirtieth day,

10
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,208
we would like to tell you,
Father,

11
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,375
we're sorry.

12
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,833
Sorry if we ever offended you.

13
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,083
Sorry if we ever hurt you.

14
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,958
Everything we did,
we did in your honor.

15
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,916
Okay.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,833
So, where were we?

17
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,666
Who made the final call?

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,750
Arye for the top
of the gravestone,

19
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,000
and Mom for the bottom.

20
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,458
Ah, got it.

21
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,791
"Loved and loving."

22
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,500
Yeah. What's the problem
with that?

23
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,458
No, just... Nothing.

24
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,041
Just that neither is true.

25
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,708
What do you care if that's how
she wants to remember it?

26
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,125
Yeah. Who cares about the truth?

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,958
I really appreciate the offer,
Poli.

28
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,541
- No.
- I mean, I hope you know that.

29
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,791
- Of course you appreciate it.

30
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,458
- It's a great offer. Yes.
- You know me.

31
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,541
Do you really think
I'm gonna change my mind?

32
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,208
How much do you make
in your consulting work?

33
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,833
-Poli!
-Why? What's wrong?

34
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,500
-That is none of your business.
-Baby, telling you,

35
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,958
-it's a terrible waste.
-Stop it.

36
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,041
You're the best
product manager in America.

37
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,708
-Mm-hmm.
-And I'm offering you here

38
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,208
an amazing start up. Not some...

39
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,041
-I know.
-...fucking corporate gig.

40
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,291
It's a hell of a ride.

41
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,166
That's what always
turned you on.

42
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,250
Doesn't turn me on anymore.

43
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,666
Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,541
I don't believe that.

45
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,416
- A drive like that doesn't--
How are you guys
doing here?

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,083
-Mind if I clear some plates?
-Yeah, thanks.

47
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,166
And would you be
interested in any dessert today?

48
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,166
Yeah, sure. Why not?
What do you--
- No.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,125
Sorry.

50
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,791
You know,
why don't I give you guys

51
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,791
- a minute, okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

52
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,375
-Sorry. Did you want something?
-No, it's okay.

53
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,541
-I just--
-Do you mean
you don't want anything?

54
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,958
Well, it's just, uh,
I have to leave 'cause, uh,

55
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,916
Ava's got
a dentist appointment soon.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,250
Ah, okay. Okay.
No problem. Uh...

57
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,166
So, how about tonight?

58
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,375
Can't tonight. I have Ava.

59
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,666
Jonathan's out of town.

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,666
Okay. Well, can't you get
a babysitter?

61
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,375
I try not to do that
on the nights

62
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,916
that I have her with me.

63
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,041
Got it. Okay.

64
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,333
Whenever you guys
are ready.
- Uh-huh.

65
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,666
Will you stay for coffee?

66
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,125
Uh, I have to get back. I can't.

67
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,791
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,583
Why don't you stay
one more night

69
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,250
and leave first thing
tomorrow morning?

70
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,583
Mom, I can't.

71
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch out, watch out.

72
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,000
-Slow down, slow down.
-Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay.

73
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,666
- Okay. Slow down.

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

75
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,708
Okay. Just drive
a little slower, okay?

76
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,916
- I'm still not used to driving.
- Yeah.

77
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,916
Your father hardly ever let me.

78
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,458
And I always really liked it.

79
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,625
So, that's a silver lining,
right?

80
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,333
What?
What do you mean?

81
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,333
No, no, nothing.

82
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,333
What nothing?

83
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,166
I mean, it's just--
I think it's okay to--

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,458
I don't know. To recognize
the positive aspects of...

85
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,291
not living with him anymore,
you know,

86
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,375
not always worrying
what Dad thinks.

87
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,708
What?

88
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,458
Do you think I'm supposed
to be happy your father is dead?

89
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,083
No, I didn't say that.
Did I say that?

90
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,916
No, I'm saying that I--

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,541
Look, he wasn't the easiest guy
to live with.

92
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,083
Right? Let's say he was
very free with his judgments.

93
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,208
So what?

94
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,708
He had high standards,
especially for himself.

95
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,833
Oh, Mom, come on.

96
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,708
Most of the time
you were just scared of him.

97
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,125
-Scared?
-Yeah, you were scared.

98
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,625
You were scared that he was
gonna accuse you

99
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,791
-of some mortal--
-Yonatan, where is this
coming from?

100
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,000
Why are you talking like this?

101
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,750
- What's wrong with talking?

102
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,458
Maybe if you and Dad
spoke more, then--

103
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,666
We spoke a lot.

104
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,625
We had five children,
we had a household to run.

105
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,666
All right.
- What, you think
we didn't speak?

106
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,916
- Okay.
- So cut it out.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,583
I'm just saying
that you spent many, many years

108
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,833
living with someone
you didn't love, okay?

109
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,333
Not to mention, you know,
attraction.

110
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,333
What?

111
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,708
I just don't want you
to feel guilty

112
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,375
about feeling
the tiniest bit relieved.

113
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, I'm not relieved.

114
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,541
Okay.
- Would you like to force me
to feel relieved?

115
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,958
- Okay.
- I loved your father.

116
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,666
Yes, yes.

117
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,541
Maybe not by your standards.

118
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,666
All right.
Well, I'm not interested

119
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,041
in having a fight with you,
okay?

120
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,083
Mmm.

121
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,125
-I'm just saying--
-I'm not.

122
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:53,875
Before you disrespect
what I had with your father,

123
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,625
- think hard...
Mm-hmm?

124
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,541
...about whether you did
everything you could

125
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,000
to stay together, you know,
to get sholom bayis.

126
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,833
All right.
Stay together for the kids.

127
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,333
- And even if so...
- The kids.

128
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,333
...what's so wrong about that?

129
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,458
What? Is that anything
to look down on?

130
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,041
You don't think
that's important?

131
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,583
A kid will always want
his parents to stay together

132
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,083
-even if it's not--
-Uh, first of all,

133
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,000
- definitely not always.
- All those people

134
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,625
who say, "Oh, if I'm happy,

135
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,625
then my kid will be happy too,"

136
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,125
that is nonsense.

137
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,125
Get a divorce, fine.
But don't lie to yourself.

138
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,416
I really-- I'm just savoring
every moment with her, you know.

139
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,458
The years go so fast,
and now we have

140
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,583
these amazing nights together.
There's--

141
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,208
-We watch movies, and--
-Are you seeing someone?

142
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,166
What? No.

143
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,666
Yeah, I think you are.

144
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,875
Well, I'm not, so.

145
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,458
And I have a feeling
I know who it is, too.

146
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm not seeing anybody,

147
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,625
and I'm not planning on it
anytime soon.

148
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,166
Is it Ackerman?

149
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,291
What? No, of course not.

150
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,541
I think it is.
And honestly,

151
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,375
I always knew it was going
to happen at some point.

152
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,250
All right.
Well, it's not Ackerman. It's--

153
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,458
I mean,
it's not anyone, actually, so.

154
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,250
Okay. Whatever. Fair enough.

155
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,125
This is me.

156
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,625
Okay. Well, uh...

157
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,541
Good luck with him.

158
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,375
I give it a year max.

159
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,375
-Okay, I'll--
-Then you leave him too.

160
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,708
Okay.

161
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,000
You know,
sometimes I just...

162
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,583
I just wish
I hadn't met you at all.

163
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,458
- I didn't spend
all these years on...
Poli, stop.

164
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,708
...someone who doesn't
understand what it means

165
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,833
to be in a relationship.

166
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,500
You're saying things
that you don't mean. Stop.

167
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,500
And what living together
actually means. Family.

168
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,125
Okay, well... I'm running late.

169
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
Bye, Poli.

170
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,625
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Mom.</i>

171
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,791
- Hey, honey. How you doing?
<i>-  Good.</i>

172
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:14,291
<i>Josie's mom wanted me to check</i>
<i>if I can watch a PG-13 movie.</i>

173
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,583
Well, I'm doing great.
Thanks for asking.

174
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,000
<i> Mom.</i>

175
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,416
Yeah, of course you can.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,333
<i> That's what I told her,</i>
<i>but she wanted me to ask. Mom?</i>

177
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,166
Um, tell her thank you
for checking and, you know,

178
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,625
if you could also
remind her that--

179
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,250
<i> We're about to have dinner,</i>
<i>so I can't really talk.</i>

180
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,791
Okay-- Yeah, but hon--
Okay, just remember, you know,

181
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,333
I have a meeting
that's really late,

182
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,833
so, um, if you need anything,

183
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,916
- just have her text me and--
<i> I know. You told me.</i>

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
<i>- Oh, Mom?</i>
- Yes, honey?

185
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,041
<i> Can I go to sleep</i>
<i>at 9:30, please?</i>

186
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,083
-Okay.
<i>-'Cause Josie's bedtime is 9:30.</i>

187
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,666
Um, Josie's a little older
than you.

188
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,833
<i> Mom.</i>

189
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,958
But, um...

190
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,000
uh, yeah, sure, you can.

191
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,250
<i>-  Thank you.</i>
- You're welcome.

192
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,958
Please try to get
some sleep though, okay?

193
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,208
<i> Okay, love you, bye.</i>

194
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,791
- Okay, love you--

195
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

196
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,041
Is she with Veronica?

197
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,458
No, she's with Josie. It's--

198
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,708
-Oh, right, right, right.
-Yeah, yeah.

199
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,208
-She's over the moon, though.
-Yeah.

200
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,791
-Sleepover on a school night.
-Oh, wow. Yeah, I bet. I mean--

201
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,458
How's your mom?

202
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,000
Uh, she's good, she's good.

203
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,791
Yeah, it ended up being
a little harder than I expected

204
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,333
- to leave, so...
- That's okay.

205
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,791
I mean, you could
have stayed. It's--

206
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,708
-No, no, no, don't--
-I texted you that--

207
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,375
No way, no way.

208
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,708
-Shall we get going?
-Yes, let's do it.

209
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,500
♪<i> You know who to turn to</i>
<i>Now everything's changed</i> ♪

210
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,791
♪<i> Come on, let's go...</i> ♪

211
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,041
You know,
when, um, I was leaving,

212
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,541
Arye said, "Happy Purim."

213
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,541
-Is today Purim?
-Sunday.

214
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,958
Oh.

215
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,333
So you know--
you know what that means?

216
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,750
Mm-mmm.

217
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,375
Our anniversary.

218
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,916
What?
What are you talking about?

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,458
Our anniversary
was, uh, September 2nd.

220
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,583
Not-- not of our wedding.

221
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,625
Of the first time we...

222
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,291
you know.

223
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,875
-After the emergency room.
-Right.

224
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,041
After my asthma attack.

225
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,625
How do you even remember
that date?

226
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,375
-Because it was Purim.
-Okay.

227
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,000
And I was over at Hoffman's.

228
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,583
We were drinking ourselves
to death.

229
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,958
And that's-- that's how
the whole thing started.

230
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,833
I thought maybe...

231
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,708
You know what?
Would you make a left turn here?

232
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,791
No, it's actually further down.

233
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,750
No, I know,
but just make a left here.

234
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,250
Is the place-- is the surprise
you were talking to me about?

235
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,875
Left.

236
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,666
-Okay, mister.
-Right here.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,458
Actually,
you know what?

238
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,416
Pull over right here.

239
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,875
You're not gonna kidnap
and murder me, are you?

240
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,500
Just pull over.

241
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,458
Can I open my eyes now?

242
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,291
Not yet.

243
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,875
Well?

244
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,250
Almost there.

245
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,250
Open your eyes.

246
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,166
Surprise.

247
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,833
- Yeah, so...

248
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,750
I kind of became obsessed
with the house.

249
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,791
Okay.

250
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,958
And I've been driving by it
on my way to work

251
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,333
and on my way back
just to see it.

252
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,000
I know it's...

253
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,791
I know.
It's very sentimental of me.

254
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,000
-It's very nice.
-Yeah.

255
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,541
So, um, anyway, uh,
when my parents visited,

256
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,041
uh, last Hanukkah,
I went on Airbnb to find a place

257
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:31,458
for them to stay and suddenly,
our house popped up.

258
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,791
Huh.

259
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,875
Yeah,
I guess they rent it out

260
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,583
when they go on vacation
or whatever.

261
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:44,875
So, um-- so I signed up
for, uh, alerts.

262
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,583
So,
are they on vacation now?

263
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,333
I guess so. Yeah.

264
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,958
So what do you say?

265
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,041
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

266
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,125
Mm-hmm.

267
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,458
Okay.

268
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,833
So...

269
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,041
- there's a lockbox...
- Okay.

270
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,791
...somewhere. Ah, here it is.

271
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,583
Four, oh, five...

272
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Okay.

273
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,416
Thank you.

274
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,125
-Boys.
-Crazy, huh?

275
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,208
What do you think, like...

276
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,500
seven and ten?

277
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, something like that. Yeah.

278
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,125
What's that smell?

279
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,541
Dead body?

280
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,875
Oh.

281
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,083
What is it?

282
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,375
Hockey stink.

283
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,708
- It's worse.

284
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,291
Sweet.

285
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,000
I guess this one
they couldn't really improve.

286
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,791
They kept the light fixtures.

287
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,291
Yeah.

288
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,833
No smoking, no pets,

289
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:30,000
- no parties or events.
- Mm.

290
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,083
Huh.

291
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,833
Is that included in the rental?

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,958
- I'll get them a new one.

293
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,125
You're such a rebel.

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,625
That's me.

295
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,791
Thanks.

296
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,791
--Happy anniversary.

297
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,166
Happy anniversary.

298
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,500
Seventeen years.

299
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,791
Can you believe it?

300
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,208
Yeah.

301
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,625
Well, my parents celebrated
their 53rd-year anniversary

302
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,708
this year.

303
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,333
That's-- That's crazy.

304
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,916
What?

305
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,750
Just, I got in a fight
with my mom.

306
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,750
But I kinda picked the fight
with her.

307
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,000
For some reason I was trying
to get her to admit

308
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,916
that her marriage
had been terrible.

309
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,416
You--

310
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,833
It's amazing how you always
become like a little boy

311
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
-around your mom.
-I know. I don't know why.

312
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,125
- Why?
- I don't know why.

313
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,750
-Don't know why I did that.
-Mm-hmm.

314
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,166
At least we talked, you know.
Like really talked.

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah.

316
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,541
Well, I'm sure she must be
so proud of you right now.

317
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,458
Yeah, in her own way.

318
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,416
Elisheva told me that
she watched my TED Talk

319
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,916
-like six times.
-Really?

320
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,875
But she'd never tell me that,
though.

321
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,541
And I can't tell her I know.

322
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,250
You know how
that whole dance goes.

323
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,916
Yeah, I know.

324
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,666
Yeah.

325
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,083
She says hi, by the way.

326
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,458
-Come on.
-It's true.

327
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,250
What?

328
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,708
You think she suspects something
about the two of us?

329
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,333
-About us?
-Yeah.

330
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,166
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

331
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,833
No way.
No, no, no, seriously, no way.

332
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,416
How can you be so sure?

333
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,541
-Because...
-Mmm.

334
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,125
Nothing could seem
more far-fetched than this.

335
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:16,250
It's completely outside
her spectrum of possibilities.

336
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,958
Mm-hmm.

337
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:23,791
And, uh, so when she saw us
go up to your old room together

338
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,750
when I visited a month ago
after your father died...

339
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,625
-Mm-hmm.
-That...

340
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,541
What? No,
it's totally acceptable

341
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,666
for children to have guests
in their old room during Shiva.

342
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,041
Right.

343
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,250
And, um, when she knocked
on the door

344
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,708
and you didn't answer it?

345
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,791
She thought I was sleeping.
I asked her afterwards. I did.

346
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,083
-I'm not convinced.
-I'm telling you,

347
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,125
if I could never imagine
this happening,

348
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,625
there's no way she could.

349
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,291
What did you imagine?

350
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,375
When you came to Shiva?

351
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,166
Honestly, I was just trying
to hide the fact

352
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,750
that I had a massive boner
in front of everybody.

353
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,750
I know.

354
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,458
I felt it when you hugged me.

355
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,291
-I wanted you to feel it.
-Oh, my God.

356
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:30,458
And then, when you asked me
to go upstairs with you,

357
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,083
I felt that all the eyes
in the house were watching us

358
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,666
and they knew exactly
what was about to happen.

359
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,458
Mmm. What did that do to you?

360
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,541
It made me wet.

361
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,791
It' was so crazy.

362
00:21:55,416 --> 00:22:00,208
In the middle of all
that family shit and grief.

363
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,708
And after all that time,
you coming in there like that,

364
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,625
like... like an apparition.

365
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,500
Well, I know.
I saw it on your face.

366
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,583
They're really, like,
making me angry, you know?

367
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah, I get that.

368
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,750
-It's not ugly.
-No.

369
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,250
They did a nice job, but like...

370
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,083
- how dare they, you know?

371
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,208
Uh-huh.

372
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,916
Still, it's better
than a hotel room, right?

373
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,166
I don't know.
I kind of like a hotel room.

374
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

375
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,875
Something about it's like,

376
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,458
it is what it is
and it's not what it's not.

377
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah, maybe.

378
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:18,500
So... anything going on?

379
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,125
What's happening?

380
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,416
What could be happening?

381
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,833
Are you seeing anyone?

382
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,000
- Since last week?
- Yeah.

383
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,083
Any promising dates?
Anything you wanna...

384
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,500
- No.
- ...take further?

385
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,791
I told you I don't want
anything serious right now.

386
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,166
-Why not?
-Okay. I have to say,

387
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,916
you're getting a little
obsessed with the subject

388
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,083
and I'm, uh, asking myself
what that is about.

389
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,416
No, nothing. I'm just--
I'm trying to grasp

390
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,000
-the concept here.
-But what concept?

391
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:54,000
Being alone. This whole
"I'm better off alone" thing.

392
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,541
It's not a concept.
I'm just happy this way.

393
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,958
Okay. Not totally buying it.

394
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,583
Right, you used to always panic
whenever I would talk

395
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,250
about being alone.

396
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,041
Yeah. You saw it as a sign
that, um, I was in a bad way,

397
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,791
but reality is, I just...

398
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,791
It was something that I felt
like I was missing.

399
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,416
You know, I'd never really
even expected

400
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,041
that I'd ever get married.

401
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,791
Yeah, I remember.

402
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,041
Even with you.

403
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,500
I know.

404
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,708
That night
when you proposed and...

405
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,041
-Mm-hmm. Talked.
-...all night...

406
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,458
-That's right.
-...about it.

407
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:41,416
Then the next morning,
I went to go see my mom.

408
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,625
I don't actually-- I don't know
if I told you much about this.

409
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,333
-I don't think so.
-Um...

410
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,208
it was in, uh, Back Bay.

411
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,500
She was living nearby
with Julian.

412
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,916
-Mm-hmm.
-Her third husband.

413
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,375
I'm not sure
if you even met him.

414
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,250
Yeah, I think I did.
I think I did once.

415
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,958
Okay. Well,
they split up soon after.

416
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,333
Anyway, she, um, she was like...

417
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,250
"Don't do it."

418
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,166
Don't do what?

419
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,416
Don't get married.

420
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,875
-She said that?
-Yeah.

421
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,250
"Jonathan's a good guy.

422
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,916
Best guy you've ever been with."

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,541
-Obviously.
-Mm-hmm.

424
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,916
"Probably the best guy
you'll ever be with."

425
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,125
- Wow, Mom, okay.

426
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,333
"But you know you're not cut out
for getting married.

427
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,583
You don't have that gene."

428
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,708
She said, "I don't have it,
your father certainly

429
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,375
doesn't have it,
so why would you have it?"

430
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,333
I mean, this is--
this is the woman

431
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,458
-that dragged you along
on her trysts...
-Yeah.

432
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,208
...when you were five years old,
so I don't think

433
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,208
really the person
to listen to, right?

434
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,250
Well, obviously, I didn't.

435
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,958
No, I was gonna prove her wrong,
gonna prove it to myself.

436
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,625
So I, you know, spent my life

437
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,541
trying to prove
that I was different.

438
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,375
And that I was gonna
make it last.

439
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,416
It didn't last.

440
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,791
So maybe she was right.

441
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,500
She's right?

442
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah. Right about the gene?

443
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,041
The monogamy gene?

444
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,833
No, it's just maybe...

445
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,791
maybe it's not right for me.

446
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:31,000
So what, does it mean
that you're doomed?

447
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,333
No.

448
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,625
Jonathan, I'm not doomed.

449
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,791
I wonder if it's hard for you
to understand because...

450
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,041
you really can't be alone.

451
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,375
I mean, you never could.

452
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,958
You always needed like,
I don't know, a...

453
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,208
witness to your life.

454
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,250
- Witness?
- Yeah.

455
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,083
-Okay.
-Yeah. Someone who's constantly,

456
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,458
you know, seeing you, and...

457
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,208
I mean, like, keeping a record.

458
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,416
Hmm. Okay.

459
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,708
No, did I hurt your feelings?

460
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,708
No, no, no.
No, no, I didn't--

461
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,916
I didn't realize
I was such a burden.

462
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,750
You're not. You weren't.

463
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,541
-It's not personal, you know.
-Okay.

464
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:29,250
I really think most women
feel this way about men.

465
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,333
Hmm.

466
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,625
Yeah.

467
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:41,166
I mean, I haven't been single
since I was 15 years old,

468
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,916
-you know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm.

469
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,250
I realized...

470
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,375
it's kind of refreshing.

471
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,166
You okay?

472
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,625
-Something's off.
-Yeah.

473
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,375
-It's just so weird.
-Yeah.

474
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:29,333
It's so weird to be here again.

475
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,875
You okay?

476
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,625
Yeah. It's nothing serious.

477
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:48,083
Maybe it was a bad idea
to come here?

478
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,958
No, I really am happy
you brought me here.

479
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:54,375
- Yeah?
 -No, it was a really nice thought.

480
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,250
Yeah, maybe it's just the day.

481
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,041
-Uh-huh.
-It's just so much.

482
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,916
Yeah.

483
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,166
Yeah, maybe we should have,
uh, yeah, postponed it, so.

484
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
-Let me get my, uh...
-Sure.

485
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:13,875
Be right back.

486
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,291
--Fuck.

487
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,708
Hey, Jane.

488
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:46,500
- <i> Jonathan.</i>
- Hi, baby.

489
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,750
<i> Oh. You only speak to me</i>
<i>when you're, like, really tired.</i>

490
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:53,125
No, yeah, I'm still up.
I'm still up.

491
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm just talking quietly
'cause Mom fell asleep already.

492
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,166
- <i> Oh.</i>

493
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,250
- Yeah.
<i>-  So sorry. Is she okay?</i>

494
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine.
It's just...

495
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,458
you know, the whole thing
at the ceremony

496
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,500
was really draining for her.

497
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,208
<i> Oh, God. Are you okay?</i>

498
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,875
Yeah. Well, you know how it is.
It's like the...

500
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:15,458
being at the cemetery, and then
going to an empty house,

501
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:17,000
it was a lot for her.

502
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:26,208
Uh, yes, taking the 6:30 train
out of Valley Stream

503
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,791
than the Amtrak
from Penn Station.

504
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,000
<i> Okay.</i>

505
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,083
- Yep.
<i>-  So, um...</i>

506
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,958
Is he up?

507
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,666
Okay, he's right there with you?

508
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,041
<i> Yeah, he wants to say hi.</i>

509
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,750
Okay. Yeah. Just, uh...

510
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,916
- Trying to connect here.

511
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,541
Okay.

512
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:52,791
Okay.

513
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,875
- Oh, hello.

514
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,916
<i>-Hi.</i>
-Hi.

515
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,708
<i>-Say Hi.</i>
-Hey, Ethan.

516
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, Bubba, why are you awake?

517
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,625
<i> He was growing some teeth.</i>
<i>Encouraging.</i>

518
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,375
<i>What's up now, where are you?</i>

519
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,125
Uh, I'm in the bathroom.

520
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,750
<i>-What?</i>
-I'm in the bathroom.

521
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,166
<i>Okay.</i>

522
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,083
<i>Look, Ethan, can you show Daddy</i>
<i>your new trick?</i>

523
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,625
Can you-- What does a dog say?

524
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,708
<i>Woof.</i>

525
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,083
<i>-Woof.</i>
-Woof. Woof?

526
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,750
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

527
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,250
He just did that today?

528
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,958
He's just, like, wants to party?

529
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:36,375
<i>He's like sleeping and eating</i>
<i>because...</i>

530
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,500
<i>I mean, he's living the life.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

531
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,333
Oh, man.

532
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,958
It's tough, huh? Sorry.

533
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,208
<i>I love you.</i>

534
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,250
-Okay. I love you too.
<i>-Bye.</i>

535
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,625
-Lila tov, bubbelah.
<i>-Lila tov.</i>

536
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,375
<i>Say "lila tov," bye.</i>

537
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,708
- Okay, baby.

538
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,666
<i>-  Okay, I'm gonna try to...</i>
- Lila tov.

539
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,708
<i>-Bye, coocoo.</i>
-Bye.

540
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,458
Bye. Bye, cooties.

541
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,250
<i>-Bye. Love to your mom, okay?</i>
-Okay. Thanks, sweetie.

542
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,500
<i>Okay.</i>

543
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh, my God.

544
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:35,125
-Wow!
-I know, right?

545
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,875
Oh, my God.

546
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,166
Can you imagine this
as Ava's room?

547
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,625
No way, we would have taken it
for ourselves.

548
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,041
Look at this.

549
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,000
Is this what you imagined
back then?

550
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:50,458
Well, yeah, not this big, but...
yeah, something like that.

551
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,916
So this is what I missed out on,
huh?

552
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,625
Well, you could have done it
yourself.

553
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,708
Yes. True.

554
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,208
Cute.

555
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:12,791
Genius kid.

556
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,250
It is a little over the top,
but I have to say

557
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,625
the effect is undeniable.

558
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,541
You okay?

559
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:55,833
Yeah.

560
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,875
Yeah, sorry,
it wasn't very serious.

561
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,083
Sorry, I disappeared on you.

562
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:04,291
Hmm, you got dressed.

563
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,166
You wanted to leave.

564
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,833
Yeah, just for a second,
but it passed.

565
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,083
Who was that on the phone?

566
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,541
-Jane.
-Mmm.

567
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,791
And Ethan.

568
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,916
Everything all right?

569
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,291
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted
to say goodnight.

570
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,458
Guilt.

571
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,291
I don't know.

572
00:36:56,458 --> 00:37:00,875
I think I'm over my obsession
with being a good person,

573
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,333
-you know?
-Mm-hmm.

574
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:08,583
Constantly checking to make sure
I'm doing the right thing.

575
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,250
I don't really have
that need anymore, for...

576
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,083
moral superiority.

577
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,416
I'm no better than anybody else.
It's okay.

578
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,708
Okay.

579
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,166
What?

580
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,000
Just not totally buying it.

581
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,375
- Touché.

582
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,083
I'm not saying I'm proud of it.

583
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,958
The affairs. But, you know...

584
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,208
Mm-hmm?

585
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:47,041
I just realized
that there's things that...

586
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,500
I mean, I have needs
that I'm not...

587
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,208
- willing to ignore anymore.
Mm-hmm.

588
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:57,875
And, you know, that's
just how it is for me right now.

589
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:00,333
Just accepting that.
That's okay.

590
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,583
"Affairs," plural?

591
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,625
Yeah, I had--
I had something six months ago.

592
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,208
It was meaningless.

593
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:21,833
Two somethings
if you count one-night stands,

594
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,916
which I don't, so.

595
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,250
Well...

596
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,083
Maybe you have lost
your moral superiority.

597
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,500
That doesn't sound very good
when you say it.

598
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,000
It's like, what?

599
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,208
I'm the last person to judge.

600
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,625
I didn't want to marry her.

601
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,541
I'm not saying that
as a justification for anything.

602
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:02,875
It's just the truth.

603
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,750
But we had a really good time
together.

604
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,250
And, you know,
sometimes it's easy to confuse

605
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,000
great sex with love.

606
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,250
Easy for you.

607
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,250
I don't think it's just me.

608
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:24,083
But she got pregnant.

609
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,041
And, um...

610
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:30,125
- I really wanted that kid.
- Hmm.

611
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,458
And, you know,
she wanted to get married.

612
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,041
And I just thought, why not?

613
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,000
What's the difference
between living together

614
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,250
and getting married?

615
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,125
So I said yes.

616
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:43,625
Then Ethan was born.

617
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,791
And he's just... ugh.

618
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,750
That's really great.

619
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,375
The sex is not.

620
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,541
Well...

621
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,500
It's not happening at all.

622
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,333
But that, you know,
since Ethan was born,

623
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:03,083
so, obviously.

624
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,083
But, um, you know, we're good.
We're good.

625
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,208
It's like we have
a common language.

626
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:14,125
It's like meeting somebody
that speaks your language.

627
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,083
I realized that
she's the first Jewish woman

628
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,875
that I've dated since college.

629
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,416
- Really?
- Yeah.

630
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,916
Yeah, I didn't-- didn't imagine
it would be so significant,

631
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,333
like, knowing the same songs
and idioms, the holidays,

632
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:33,625
but it's nice.
It's comfortable.

633
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,125
Don't you love her?

634
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:41,541
Hmm.

635
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,791
Yeah. Yeah, in a certain way.

636
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:55,791
What if she finds out about us?

637
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,416
Um...

638
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,208
I don't know.

639
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,208
I guess I'm just--
I'm not really scared enough...

640
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,750
of splitting up.

641
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,208
In fact, I'm pretty sure
it'll happen eventually.

642
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,375
So I don't really have
any illusions about that.

643
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,250
I'll never love anybody
the way that I loved you.

644
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,333
-It's a fact.
-Hmm.

645
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,375
With you, breaking up
was just never on the table.

646
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,916
Just never even occurred to me.

647
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,166
So it's just, it's different,
entirely different kind of love.

648
00:41:56,166 --> 00:42:00,250
I remember someone said
it was like a piece of tape

649
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,458
that you rip off
and try to reapply...

650
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,333
that'll stick again maybe,

651
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,000
but it's never going to be
like the first time.

652
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,875
It's really sad,
what you're saying.

653
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,208
I don't know. I don't think so.

654
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,750
I think it's okay
to have different kinds of love.

655
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,083
That's okay.

656
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,166
- What?

657
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,833
What?

658
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,791
Just don't act like it's cool,
you're never gonna love again.

659
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,041
It's not that s--

660
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,791
I didn't say that.

661
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,458
I mean I'm here with you,
aren't I?

662
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,000
It's different with me.
I mean,

663
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,125
- it's not the same, obviously.
- Why?

664
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,708
Because we've been...

665
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,958
through the worst
that could happen. I mean,

666
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,291
there's nothing to be afraid of
anymore with me.

667
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,375
Yeah, okay,
so maybe that's just--

668
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:51,750
that's exactly what works
for me now.

669
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,458
-For us.
-God, Jonathan.

670
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,958
What? What?

671
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:59,583
Can't you see
we're both just so fucked up?

672
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:02,125
We've barely even started
getting over what happened to us

673
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,750
-and--
-Yeah, well, it takes time.

674
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,625
Yeah, but it's been four years.

675
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,083
We just keep coming up with
all these solutions and like...

676
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,750
Why does it take
so long to break up?

677
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,125
And why does no one talk about
the fact that

678
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,458
it's this fucking
endless trauma?

679
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,458
Well, it...

680
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:24,833
It is second on the list
of most stressful life events.

681
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:27,958
Before moving.

682
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,875
After death of a loved one.

683
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,375
So...

684
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,916
So we should have a Shiva
of our own?

685
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,458
To mourn?

686
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,583
Yes.

687
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,208
We won't leave the house
for seven days.

688
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,750
Everyone will come
and console us.

689
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:03,875
Mm-hmm.

690
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,791
And we won't eat meat
or drink wine.

691
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,333
-Mm-hmm.
-Or shower.

692
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,416
I can work with that.

693
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,458
We won't cut our hair or shave.

694
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:22,750
Done.

695
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,375
No sex.

696
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,916
What? That's forbidden too?

697
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,125
Totally.

698
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,250
What is it? What's wrong?

699
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:40,500
Did you have a nightmare?

700
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,125
-What was it?
-Oh, God...

701
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,166
We were driving.

702
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,916
Oh, fuck.

703
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,625
Oh, my God.

704
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:20,083
Oh, fuck.

705
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,208
What?

706
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:27,750
We were, um...

707
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,250
We were driving to Lawrence
to see my parents

708
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,916
and, um, Ava was with us.

709
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,083
We were on the highway.

710
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,666
There was an accident
and there was terrible traffic

711
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,208
for miles and miles,
and so I...

712
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:50,458
I said to you,
"Let's go back home on foot."

713
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:53,375
But we had to cross
to the other lane.

714
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,708
- And you and Ava crossed.
Mm-hmm.

715
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,541
But I didn't-- I couldn't--
you had to push the cars

716
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,291
- to get through them.
Mm-hmm.

717
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:03,458
Like, you had to physically
push them away from each other.

718
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:05,833
But it-- but it turns out
I didn't have any hands.

719
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,875
I just had like stumps, like,
nothing from the elbows down.

720
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:11,833
So like, I-- it was impossible
for me to reach you guys.

721
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:14,291
- Oh, I'm sorry.

722
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,291
Hey, come here.

723
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,708
It's cold.

724
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,708
Hmm.

725
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,875
You want some water?

726
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,541
- No.
- No?

727
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,958
You know,
I could make us some coffee.

728
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,666
Maybe it's time
that we get up anyway.

729
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,375
No, don't go, don't go anywhere.
Just stay. Just stay.

730
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,500
Okay.

731
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:57,791
Just stay.

732
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,708
Do you remember anything else?

733
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,458
I'm trying to remember.

734
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,500
You know, yesterday...

735
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:16,041
-My mom has this notebook...
-Mm-hmm.

736
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,750
...where she wrote down
a bunch of things

737
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:22,125
when I was little,
like, you know,

738
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:26,708
anecdotes and medical stuff,
and dreams.

739
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:27,875
That's really sweet.

740
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,875
Yeah, we were looking at it
together yesterday.

741
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:33,958
And there was this one time
that she wrote about

742
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:36,166
when I woke up
in the middle of the night,

743
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,708
I was like three years old
or something, and...

744
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,166
-Mm-hmm.
-...I came into the room

745
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,791
and I was just standing there
in the middle of the room

746
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,291
and I said, "I can't sleep.

747
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,375
All my dreams
are really boring."

748
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:49,583
And I said to her yesterday,
I was like,

749
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:52,333
"You got it back then, right?
You got-- you understood

750
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:57,375
that 'boring'
actually meant scary, right?"

751
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:00,208
And she said,
"What are you talking about?

752
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,250
No, you were so cute, no,
you didn't look scared at all."

753
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:10,250
She just was incapable of...

754
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:13,708
She couldn't...

755
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,125
Sometimes, I feel...

756
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:29,708
like I'm not sure
if I have the ability...

757
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,833
like if I've ever really...

758
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,375
truly loved anyone.

759
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,958
Or if I've ever
really been loved.

760
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,916
Okay, now you're being dramatic.

761
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:54,541
-Am I?
-Yes.

762
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,750
I love you.

763
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,041
And I always have,
in my own...

764
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,458
deranged way.

765
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:14,083
And you love me
in your own complicated way.

766
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,416
And you'll always love me.

767
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,458
"In the middle of the night,

768
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,166
without any fanfare,

769
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:04,083
in a dark house
somewhere in the world."

770
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,875
What's that?

771
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:12,833
Mmm, it's from a movie.

772
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,791
Hmm.

773
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:47,291
- Okay. Let's cut.
- All right, we cut.

774
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,458
Here you are, guys.
