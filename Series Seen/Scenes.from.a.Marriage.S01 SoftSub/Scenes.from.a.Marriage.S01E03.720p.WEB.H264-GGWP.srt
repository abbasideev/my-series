1
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,416
Okay. We peek through the wall.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,166
Toshiro, camera
goes to the porch.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,291
Okay.
Let's close the front door.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,208
Clear. Let's stand by to roll.

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,083
Yeah. That's great.

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,958
All right. Here we go.
And action.

7
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,000
Wow.

8
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,708
You don't like it? You like it?

9
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,041
No. It's just, uh...
come in. Come in.

10
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,625
- Hi.
- Hi.

11
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,625
Hey.

12
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,583
Okay. Come inside.

13
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,958
- Is she sleeping?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,416
She went down early.

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,250
How was bedtime? Was it...

16
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,958
- Um...
- You got a new living room.

17
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:11,541
Yes. Uh, well, the armchair is...
they were... you know, the...

18
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,625
The Henningsens?

19
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,166
Yeah. Yeah.
They were very pretty,

20
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,541
but they weren't really
comfortable for watching TV.

21
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,375
You never complained
about it before.

22
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,208
Well, I never really got
to watch TV before.

23
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,666
Oh.

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,583
And the rug it's...
I mean, listen, this is...

25
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:30,333
it's really, really ugly.

26
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,333
You think so?

27
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,416
Oh, my God. Yeah.
Look at this couch.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,458
What?

29
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,833
It's an affront
to the green one.

30
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,333
Look, it's like they're
facing off.

31
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,208
Yeah, well,
it's very comfortable, though.

32
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,083
It's hideous.
Where'd you get it? IKEA?

33
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,625
Uh, yeah, actually.

34
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,000
- Yeah. But it's cozy.
- Now, why didn't you call me?

35
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,625
I would've taken you shopping.

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,708
I don't know, I... I mean, I
would've even done it myself.

37
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,666
I don't know.
I just took care of it.

38
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,041
So, when'd you do all this
with your hair?

39
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,583
Uh, about a week ago.

40
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,208
Oh, okay. Thought Ava would
have told you, so...

41
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,000
No, she's...
Ava's about the most discreet

42
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,125
five-year-old on the planet.

43
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,916
Sometimes it really
just breaks my heart,

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,083
- how much she holds in.
- I know. Yeah.

45
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,916
How was she after school today?

46
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,708
She was fine. Yeah.
Nothing unusual. Why?

47
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,041
Oh. Just drop-off
was a little tough, you know?

48
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,333
She's... her stomach hurt,
and she cried a little bit.

49
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:21,916
Hmm.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,958
Did you do drop-off
or did Poli?

51
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,666
Me. Poli's away.
He left a few days ago.

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,541
- Okay. -It's actually easier
when he drops her off.

53
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,625
Makes sense.

54
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,333
Yeah. I know.

55
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,250
So, you wanted to talk?

56
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,875
Yeah.

57
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,166
- Okay. Wanna sit in there?
- Sure. Yeah.

58
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,750
Oh, wow. I didn't know
you started this up again.

59
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,166
Oh, what, Shabbat dinner? Yeah.

60
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,458
Uh, yeah, I don't know.
It's kind of...

61
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,166
um, my parents came over
a few weeks ago for Shabbat,

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,333
and Ava really took to it.

63
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,250
- Huh.
- Does that bother you?

65
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,375
No.

66
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,375
I don't think so.

67
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,500
I mean, I think it's been
like ten years

68
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,166
- since you've done this.
- Yeah, well,

69
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,291
you never really liked it.

70
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,125
You liked that I didn't like it.

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,125
I think it's really good
for her, actually, you know?

72
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,208
Gives her like a sense of...

73
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,166
structure
and a sense of belonging.

74
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,375
Um, you want some?

75
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,250
From Rosenfeld Bagels,
it's really good.

76
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,375
No, thanks.

77
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,666
I'll take some of that wine.

78
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah. Sure.

79
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,875
I'll join you.

80
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,041
Okay.

81
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,541
<i>Lechayim.</i>

82
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,625
Cheers.

83
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,250
Eyes.

84
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,791
So...

85
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,875
So... I've been offered
a promotion.

86
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,083
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

87
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,708
It's to oversee
the, um, European division.

88
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,250
Oh. Wow.

89
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,541
But I would have
to relocate to London.

90
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,875
So, you know, when
I got back from Tel Aviv,

91
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:08,500
Ackerman, he was really happy
with, uh, the work I did.

92
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,375
I mean, you know,
I did a good job,

93
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,541
just objectively speaking.

94
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,375
Um, so anyway we merged
the Tel Aviv office

95
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,750
into the European division
and he said,

96
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,916
Ackerman, he was like,
"Just take all of Europe."

97
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,208
- Manager in London's leaving.
- Okay.

98
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,583
- It's a big promotion.
- Obviously.

99
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,583
It's a lot of money.

100
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,250
So I was hoping that
we could, you know,

101
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,333
talk through some ideas and
see if we could strategize.

102
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,583
- Strategize?
- Yeah.

103
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,333
What do you mean?
What... strategize about what?

104
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,083
Well, I don't know. That's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

105
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,916
But what...

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,916
What did you tell Ackerman?
Like, how did you leave it?

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,083
I said that it... you know,
I needed to talk to you first.

108
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,166
It was an amazing offer,
but, you know,

109
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,541
I needed to talk to you.

110
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,166
Okay. So what are you...

111
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,875
you're thinking that you're
gonna go back to...

112
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,666
-flying here every other weekend to see Ava again?
- No. No, of course not.

113
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,583
You think that I would actually
leave her again?

114
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,250
Oh, all right. All right.
So then what?

115
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,458
Taking her with you?

116
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,416
No. No. Not exactly.

117
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,875
Yeah, well, I guess that
could be an option if that's...

118
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,708
No. It's not an option.

119
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,083
It's not an option,
so you can forget about that.

120
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,333
Unreal.

121
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,833
Okay. I didn't say that
that's what I wanted to do.

122
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,291
I said I wanted to talk
this over together.

123
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,625
So why... Honey, why are you
getting so upset?

124
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,541
This is a... it's a huge deal,
and it's a lot of money.

125
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,875
Money that matters to all of us.

126
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,416
Okay. Will you just stop
right there with the money?

127
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,708
Well, I don't have
a concrete solution.

128
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,041
That's why I was hoping
we could hash it out together.

129
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,208
Yeah, of course you don't
have a concrete solution

130
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,541
because there is no
concrete solution.

131
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,833
So why would you bring it up?
Just to see how I'd react?

132
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

133
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,500
I get it.

134
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,250
Maybe it was a mistake
coming here.

135
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know if we can be
in the same room yet

136
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,833
without, you know,
hurting each other.

137
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,416
What?

138
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,291
What?
What are you not telling me?

139
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,708
Mira? I know you.

140
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,458
You wouldn't bring all this up
if you didn't have a plan.

141
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,833
What do you want?

142
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,125
I was... Okay.
I was thinking that, um...

143
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,708
maybe the two of you
could come to London.

144
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,750
Like, uh, Ava and you.

145
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,000
I thought that could be
a possibility.

146
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:06,500
I mean, you're on, uh,
sabbatical this year, right?

147
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,375
So you can write from anywhere.
It doesn't have to be here.

148
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,625
I mean, what if you got
an apartment nearby?

149
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,166
And we could do shared custody,
like we do here.

150
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,541
London's the perfect place
for you to write.

151
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,500
There's the libraries
and the archives,

152
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,041
and Oxford's there, so...

153
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,916
You know, Horizons
would be so happy

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,583
to get another apartment and pay for
living expenses if I asked them.

155
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,750
Oh, wow.
That's very nice of them.

156
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,416
Well, it's true.

157
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,583
I mean...

158
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,791
Come on. Aren't you dying
to get out of this place?

159
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,125
You're always saying that
this country's poisoning you.

160
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,208
And it would be an experience
of a lifetime for Ava.

161
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,166
It would be just
a great opportunity for her.

162
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,666
You can't deny that.

163
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,500
I can't... I can't believe

164
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,625
you're serious right now.
I really can't.

165
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,416
Don't answer me right now.
Just think about it.

166
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,166
Just think, like...

167
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,625
you know, we don't have
to make a decision this second.

168
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,750
- Just...
- Right. Yeah. Yeah.

169
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,166
Just, you know,
don't rule it out.

170
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,625
- That's all I'm asking you.
- Okay, yeah. Don't rule it out.

171
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,125
Of course I'm gonna rule it out.
What do you... what...

172
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,458
what, do you think that
we're just like a suitcase

173
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,583
that you can pack up
and take with you?

174
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,041
- Wow.
- That we're gonna follow you

175
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,208
wherever you feel like going,
no matter how disruptive it is

176
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,375
- for Ava and for me?
- Okay. Speak for yourself.

177
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,875
I'm sure Ava would be
really happy about this.

178
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,916
No, I think I will speak for Ava

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,500
'cause obviously
somebody needs to.

180
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,416
- Oh, okay. -She just got used
to you being back again,

181
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,916
and living in two different
houses and all of that.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,541
But it'd be the same there.
There'd be two houses there.

183
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,875
- It's not the same.
- It's the same schedule there.

184
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,833
Mira, it's not the same.
She has a whole world here.

185
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,291
She has her friends.
I... Okay.

186
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,333
- I know. -And her grandparents,
that she's crazy about.

187
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,375
Okay, she could see them
over the summer, it's...

188
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,500
She has a whole life here.

189
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,375
- Do you understand that?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

190
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,166
A family. A whole community.

191
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,041
- Community.
- Yes. A commu...

192
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,333
I'm sorry if that word
offends you.

193
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,583
I know that you guys live
in this global village

194
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,416
where it doesn't matter
what you see,

195
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,875
it makes no difference
where you go, or any of that.

196
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,625
I'm sorry.
Who's "you guys" in this?

197
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,958
- Really?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,041
You guys.

199
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,750
Here. It was on the cabinet.

200
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,708
You know,
while we're on the subject,

201
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,541
we should probably
start talking a little bit

202
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,208
about the divorce.

203
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,166
Divorce?

204
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,333
Yeah. It just seems like
we should start settling things.

205
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,500
Don't you think?

206
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,458
Sure.
If it's, uh, important to you.

207
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,708
Uh, we can get it done in a day.
It's...

208
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,458
Yeah, I think it's a little
more complicated than that.

209
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,916
I'm not sure a day
is gonna cut it.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,250
Then a... a week then.

211
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,791
Especially if you're
planning on traveling soon.

212
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,958
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure.

213
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,250
Whatever works
for you, Jonathan.

214
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,500
- That's fine.
- Okay.

215
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,916
Um, why? Are you...
are thinking about

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,916
getting remarried or something?

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
What? No. No, no, no.

218
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,166
I just think
that this state of...

219
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,250
you know, purgatory is just not
very healthy for you...

220
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,000
Purgatory? Come on.
Don't understate it.

221
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,333
No, no. I just mean
that this... temporary state,

222
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,500
you know, this in-between-ness.

223
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,833
Are you seeing someone?

224
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,333
What does... what does that
have to do with anything?

225
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,250
So you are?

226
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,625
Oh, leave me alone.

227
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,291
What? Why can't you tell me
about it?

228
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,208
Because I don't want to.

229
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,333
Okay.

230
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,000
Anyway...

231
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,625
I think, um...

232
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,583
that we'd all benefit...

233
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,416
from having a little more

234
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,125
definition and clarity.
Don't you think?

235
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,875
So you decided
to kill yourself?

236
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,875
Oh, come on.

237
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,125
When did you start
smoking again?

238
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,708
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

239
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,000
A few months ago.
I don't do it that much.

240
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,333
I don't do it in front of Ava.

241
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,833
Fine. Do what you want.
I'm not gonna be here

242
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,875
to take you to the ER the next
time you have an asthma attack.

243
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,125
I'm not having any attacks.

244
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,875
Can't remember
the last time I had one.

245
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,041
Okay.

246
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,291
Everything okay?
She's sound asleep?

247
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,000
I didn't know
anything about that.

248
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,541
What, the office?

249
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,291
I'm telling you, that kid
can really keep a secret.

250
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,333
What's the deal here?

251
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,375
What do you mean?

252
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,458
What's wrong
with the bedrooms upstairs?

253
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,291
Uh, you know, just...

254
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,291
felt too big up there
for us after...

255
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,750
I don't know, the whole house
felt too big, and...

256
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,791
And she couldn't
really fall asleep on her own,

257
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,333
so she ended up sleeping
with me in my bed, and...

258
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,541
when I'd head downstairs
to do work,

259
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,250
she would wake up
and follow me down.

260
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,666
So it just kind of
evolved naturally.

261
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,791
I don't really need a study,
you know?

262
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,125
I work in the living room,
mostly, so...

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,750
What about your privacy?

264
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,875
Well, there's that bookshelf
between us.

265
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,583
- It's almost like a wall. -If you
have someone over, what do you...

266
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,583
what do you do?
I mean, Ava doesn't wake up?

267
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,791
I don't have anyone over
when Ava's here. Ever.

268
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,916
- Mind if I look?
- Sure.

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,458
You need anything here?

270
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,375
There's, um, a box there with,
uh, some kitchenware

271
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,833
and the china
your grandparents gave us.

272
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,291
Yeah. I'm gonna, uh...

273
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,208
I'll, uh, send someone
to get it this week.

274
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,666
No rush.

275
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

276
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,833
You know, I... I think
I'm gonna get going.

277
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,583
Do you want anything else
to drink?

278
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,458
Maybe a little more wine?

279
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,583
Just a little bit?

280
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,791
- Okay. A little.
- Okay.

281
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,458
- Fine. Yeah.
- All right.

282
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,208
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

283
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,625
Soon there won't be
any trace of me here.

284
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,375
It's fine. It's...

285
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,291
It's totally fine.
It's just this, uh...

286
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,791
silly attachment to furniture...

287
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,083
the myth of a home...

288
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,041
and all our dependence
on these things. It's...

289
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,333
That's what keeps
fucking everything up.

290
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,875
I mean, it's what fucked it up
for us.

291
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:27,500
You know, being dependent
on these objects.

292
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,375
Yeah, you know,
the objects never had

293
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,416
any real significance for me.

294
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Come on. Our whole relationship
became an object.

295
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,791
The house, the family...

296
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,500
You know what I mean.

297
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,708
Mm-hmm.

298
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,875
So it's, um... well, it's not...

299
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,250
- different now for you?

300
00:19:54,333 --> 00:20:00,708
You don't feel attached
to stuff in your new place?

301
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,666
The luxury condo in the
Millennium Tower, you mean?

302
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,208
Whatever.

303
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,375
But yeah, that's my point.
I mean, um...

304
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:19,458
I have no personal
attachment to anything there.

305
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:25,041
I just had a designer
furnish the place and then...

306
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:33,250
But Poli... It's his dream.

307
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,083
It's his American dream,
you know?

308
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,958
Twentieth floor,
overlooking the park,

309
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,458
doorman, and all that.

310
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,750
It's amazing how it
gives him confidence.

311
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,083
Hmm.

312
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,958
I think I've reached
a point in my life

313
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:00,833
where it doesn't matter
where I live anymore.

314
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,333
I mean, there's no place
in the world

315
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,166
that would make me feel secure.

316
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,166
I'm sorry to hear that.

317
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,500
Don't be.

318
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,666
I'm not sorry.

319
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,625
On the contrary,
it's a relief, you know, to...

320
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,500
I mean, there's nothing
like that.

321
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,666
Like security, safety.

322
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,250
We thought there was.

323
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,375
We wanted there to be.

324
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,083
But then we turn it
into a ritual, you know?

325
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,625
- It was like...
- I know that, like...

326
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,375
I know that you have this need

327
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,916
to diminish
everything that we had...

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,208
No, I'm not...

329
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,875
-...and justify it. You're...
- Honey, I'm not diminishing it.

330
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,000
No. On the...

331
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,416
- Sounds like you are.
- No, I'm not. I'm...

332
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,375
I'm just trying to tell you
that for me, it was, um...

333
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,333
There was so much denial,
you know?

334
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,375
I mean, today, I know.
I'm alone. I'm all alone.

335
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,916
Nothing's gonna change that.

336
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,750
It doesn't matter where I am
or who I'm with.

337
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,250
And, um, it's...

338
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,833
good to understand and
make peace with that, you know?

339
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,958
I think it's a...
it's a sign of strength, even.

340
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,500
What?

341
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,083
Nothing. I'm listening.

342
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,250
Don't look so worried.
I'm fine.

343
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,250
- Are you?
- Yes.

344
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,458
- Really?
- Yes!

345
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,708
- What?
- I don't know. I'm just...

346
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,375
I'm, you know, I'm having
these flashbacks to...

347
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,791
to your monologues
from college.

348
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,958
Every time you and Lucas
broke up, you know,

349
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:10,666
it was always, "Oh, how
wonderful it is to acknowledge"

350
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,625
that you're actually alone
in the world."

351
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,500
I never... I never said
it was wonderful.

352
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,750
Yeah, but I mean,
it was... it was obviously

353
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,625
a kind of like mania

354
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,166
where you were suppressing
all this pain,

355
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,541
but then it would flip
to depression

356
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,708
and you'd go running back to him

357
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,375
'cause you couldn't
actually be alone.

358
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,083
I mean, it just was so obvious.

359
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,916
It's so obvious
that it's a defense mechanism.

360
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,500
Great.

361
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,333
You know, it's pretty insulting
when someone uses psychology

362
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,875
to, uh, try and pick apart
actual insight

363
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,416
that you've really had.

364
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,750
Can't you just believe
that this is how I feel?

365
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,833
I do believe you.

366
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,958
- I'm also, you know...
- You're right. I'm sorry.

367
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,250
I'm not, um, coming
from the same place anymore.

368
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,208
I'm not 20 years old, you know?

369
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,458
Okay.

370
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,416
What's with all this fucking
psychological bullshit anyway?

371
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,333
What, you dating a shrink?

372
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,500
I am... I'm going to one.

373
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:17,041
Yeah. Not a... not a shrink.
A therapist.

374
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

375
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,375
You're... You're kidding me.

376
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,958
No, no, no, no.
I'm going to one.

377
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,375
Um, I mean, I needed it.
And it's, uh...

378
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,125
honestly, it's... it helped me.
It is helping me.

379
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,625
What does it help you with?

380
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:41,000
Um, first of all,
to understand, you know?

381
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,291
To make sense
of everything, of...

382
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,625
of what happened.

383
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,125
- To put it into words.
- Yeah.

384
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:54,708
'Cause I... I couldn't
even begin to comprehend

385
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,333
what had happened.

386
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:58,958
You know?

387
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,416
Um, she gave me this, uh,
exercise to do this thing

388
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,375
called morning pages,
where you have to write

389
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,416
three pages,
uh, as soon as you get up,

390
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,458
before you've had your coffee,
before you've done anything.

391
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,750
Um, you know, first thing
that comes into your mind.

392
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,958
Have you heard of that?

393
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,583
Hmm, yeah. Maybe.

394
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,416
Sorry.

395
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,166
It's okay.

396
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,250
I'm so exhausted.

397
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,583
- Mm.
- It's the wine and, um...

398
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,458
I just...
I haven't been sleeping,

399
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,000
you know,
since the London offer.

400
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,625
It's just Ackerman's
putting so much pressure on me.

401
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,833
Sure. Yeah.
That's okay. I get it.

402
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,458
Um, are you okay to drive home?

403
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,125
You sure you don't want
any coffee?

404
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,375
Wait. You were
in the middle of something.

405
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,666
No, it's okay. It's all right.
It's all good.

406
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,791
- Wh...
- So espresso, right?

407
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,041
Hey!

408
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,125
Please don't make a big deal
out of this.

409
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,500
It has nothing to do
with anything.

410
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,625
It's just...
I wanna hear about it.

411
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,666
It's just my... I'm so...
I'm so tired.

412
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,791
It's my exhaustion.

413
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,291
No. No. Look, nothing happened.
Everything's okay.

414
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,166
But I wanted...
I want you to finish

415
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,458
what you were telling me,
please.

416
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,375
I mean, maybe
you could read it to me.

417
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,583
Read what?

418
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,791
The morning papers, I think...

419
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,708
- Morning pages.
- No. No, no, the...

420
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,208
The whole point's that you're
not supposed to show anybody.

421
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,458
Well, but you can just...
you can read it to me, okay?

422
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,250
And I won't tell anyone
that you did, okay?

423
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,291
Here you go.

424
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,791
I don't want coffee.

425
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,875
Read to me, please. Why...

426
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,708
Why is this
so important to you?

427
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,375
You're important to me.

428
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,500
I... I could just go get it.

429
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,291
No. Okay, okay. Fine.

430
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,750
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

431
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,208
I'm not sure
there's much of a chance.

432
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,208
I can read my own handwriting.

433
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,541
Maybe I'll read you something
that I wrote this morning.

434
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,166
I can still kind of remember it.

435
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:28,916
Okay.

436
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,666
It's written
in the third person.

437
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,333
I don't know why it came out
like that. It just did.

438
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,291
The whole point is that
you're just supposed to...

439
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,625
to go with the flow.

440
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,291
Okay. Um...

441
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:50,875
"Apparently, his obsessive
rational thinking"

442
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:55,916
at that age was
only compensation

443
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,666
for all the anxieties.

444
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,541
Because there was the father,
this dominant father

445
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,041
casting a shadow over him,

446
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,208
judgmental,
with strict moral codes,

447
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,791
"and he... " Meaning me.

448
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:12,833
Mm.

449
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:16,166
Uh, "Tried so hard
to please this father",

450
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,458
to live up to his standards,

451
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,666
but he always felt like
he'd failed,

452
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,708
so that, gradually, he developed
this permanent feeling

453
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:31,083
of 'I'm not good enough,
I'm not moral enough,

454
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,375
I'm too egocentric, '

455
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,541
which, in the world
he grew up in,

456
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,375
is the worst possible sin.

457
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,875
And on the other hand,
there was the mother,

458
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:46,916
who was always too weak
to face down this tough father.

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,375
But she was such
an anxious person herself

460
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:53,750
that even with her, this boy,
he couldn't really be himself,

461
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,041
he couldn't share
his hardships, his fears,

462
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,333
because she'd immediately
get so overwhelmed

463
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:02,416
that her anxiety
would only compound his.

464
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,458
And then, when he realized
no one actually saw him,

465
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,541
his true self that is,

466
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:11,250
no one could help him cope with
everything he was going through,

467
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,000
he fell deeper
and deeper into himself,

468
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,000
and kept all of his pain
and anxiety inside,

469
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,208
and never told anyone anything,

470
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,291
and this split inside him

471
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:24,166
wouldn't let him truly be
in a relationship,

472
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,583
because there was always
part of him that he kept hidden,

473
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,000
he was never fully present,

474
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,333
until Mira showed up.

475
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:37,458
And to a certain extent,
she saved him by seeing him.

476
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,291
For the first time in his life,
he felt like he might be pulled

477
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,708
out of the inherent loneliness.

478
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,875
But only after she left
did he realize how,

479
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:55,500
even with her,
he was there-not-there,

480
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,125
and how hard it must have been
to live with this,

481
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:01,333
with someone who was always
partly somewhere else,

482
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,458
inside his own head,

483
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:07,333
how that could make her feel
lonely and unseen.

484
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:11,958
And this realization helped him
deal with her leaving him,

485
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,583
to make sense of it,

486
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,666
and that disabused him
of the idea

487
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,291
"that he'd been a victim of some
kind of sudden cataclysm."

488
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,958
Oh, fuck.

489
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,666
Stop.

490
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,791
- This isn't good.
- What?

491
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,666
It's not good.

492
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,416
I don't... I don't want this.
I don't wanna sleep with you.

493
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,083
It's not good for me.

494
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:18,208
It took me a really long time
to get where I am right now.

495
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,375
I don't wanna...

496
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,041
I don't want to go back
to that fucking torment.

497
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,458
No.

498
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,875
I just don't...

499
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,625
I don't think you actually
really understand

500
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,750
what it was like for me
here a year ago.

501
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:45,916
I wanna know. Tell me. Tell me.

502
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,750
- Do you really?
- Yes.

503
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,125
That first moment, I was...

504
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,125
I was just on autopilot.

505
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,416
I woke Ava up,
I got her dressed,

506
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,958
I dropped her off at preschool,

507
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:14,083
and I canceled all my classes,
and then I came back home.

508
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:21,041
And I thought I was literally
losing my mind.

509
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,416
Then there was a moment
where I thought

510
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,583
that I didn't even want
to stay alive.

511
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,916
There was lots of moments
where I was sure

512
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,791
I didn't want you to stay alive.

513
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,666
Like, I really
wanted you to die.

514
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:50,916
And then there was...

515
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:56,458
there was a moment
when I wanted Ava to die.

516
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,916
For that to be my revenge.

517
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,708
And then that night,
she started coughing like crazy.

518
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:12,000
And at one point, she threw up
from coughing so much.

519
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,041
And then she spiked
a fever of 104

520
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,625
and I wasn't sure if I should
take her to the emergency room.

521
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,375
That's why I ended up
putting her in a bathtub.

522
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:25,541
And that lasted all night,
and I was scared to death.

523
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,416
I thought I'd killed her.

524
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:39,000
And it took three days
for the antibiotics to kick in.

525
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,958
And that was a nightmare,
but it was also the best thing

526
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,958
that could happen to me
because I didn't have

527
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,625
a second to myself,
I barely slept.

528
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,791
And then you came back
on the weekend

529
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,791
and you took her and...

530
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,916
her fever was
already gone by then.

531
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,375
I was... and I was alone
all of a sudden.

532
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:04,583
But I was already
in a more human state.

533
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,333
I could breathe by then.

534
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,333
And start some kind of healing.

535
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,750
Then a few minutes would go by
and I wouldn't think about it.

536
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,041
Think about you.

537
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,666
Then a few hours.

538
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,875
Now, I'll go half a day
without thinking about it.

539
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,000
Sometimes the whole day,
especially when Ava's here.

540
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,666
So, yeah, no way
I'm going back to that.

541
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,666
You know, we'll have sex
and it'll be amazing,

542
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,375
and then it's all the way back
to the bottom.

543
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,125
No way.

544
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,208
What makes you think
it was any different for me?

545
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,333
Oh, Mira.

546
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,791
It was a nightmare for me too.

547
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,250
I couldn't stop thinking
about you.

548
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,625
Not even for a second.

549
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,041
I just, uh...

550
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,750
Please don't...
please don't do that.

551
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,375
Don't do what?

552
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,833
Don't.

553
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,125
Don't say things you don't mean

554
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,083
just to prove that we're in
the same boat, 'cause we're not.

555
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,250
But how would you know?

556
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,833
I just miss you all the time.

557
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,583
I never stopped loving you,
not even for a second.

558
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,875
I never stopped wanting you.

559
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,291
I want you now so bad.

560
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,291
This whole past week,
I come just thinking about you.

561
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:26,958
Hold on.

562
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:38,458
Sweetie, stop. Please.
Please. No.

563
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,666
I'm sorry.

564
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,166
It's okay.

566
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,375
Do you want me to go now?

567
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,750
Thanks.

568
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,375
You sure I can't get you
any coffee or anything?

569
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,541
No? Okay.

570
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:56,041
What time
are you picking up Ava?

571
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,750
Uh, in the morning,
around 10:00.

572
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,916
Okay.

573
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,291
You'll have her bag ready
for school on Monday?

574
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,500
Of course.

575
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,125
Okay.

576
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,625
If Poli wasn't coming, would
that change anything for you?

577
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,208
What?

578
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,416
If I was going
to London alone...

579
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,208
would you consider
coming with Ava?

580
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,750
What's Poli have to do
with anything?

581
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,750
All right.

582
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,583
I can't drive right now.

583
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:13,708
Stay here tonight, okay? Okay?

584
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,458
I got some shirts.
Do you want one?

585
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,208
Thank you.

586
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,708
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

587
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,333
Shit, sorry.

588
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,125
Is that your girlfriend?

589
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,666
I wouldn't go that far.

590
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,750
Your lover?

591
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:19,000
Did you tell her that
I was coming over tonight?

592
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,250
Yes.

593
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,000
Just try to ignore it.

594
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,875
She's not giving up.
That's dedication.

595
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:52,166
Sorry. I'll just turn it off.

596
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,375
Just give me one second, okay?

597
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,458
Hey.

598
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:11,666
Good. Uh, yeah, but listen,

599
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,166
it's not cool to,
like, bombard me with...

600
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,833
<i>Because you were</i>
<i>supposed to call me.</i>

601
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:18,833
I told you,
I'd call you when she left.

602
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,750
<i>Oh, so she hasn't gone yet?</i>

603
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,791
No, she hasn't.
She's still here, okay?

604
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,333
She's... she's in bed.

605
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,500
My bed.

606
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,625
Listen. Laura? Laura?

607
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,250
We... we need to talk,
'cause this is...

608
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,916
this is really just not, uh...

609
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:43,041
Okay, well what I'm saying is
that we should take a break

610
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,041
because this is just not...

611
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,041
not working out for me
right now.

612
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,166
Not a, uh, uh... I wouldn't...

613
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,833
Okay, you know, let me just...
let me stop you here

614
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:59,166
before you say something
that you're gonna regret.

615
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,375
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry
it has to end like this.

616
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:11,666
But, uh, honestly, I've been
feeling for a while that...

617
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,000
well, you know, that...

618
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,416
I'm not...

619
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:22,375
Okay, bye.

620
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:31,958
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

621
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,750
I just couldn't help
overhearing it.

622
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:38,375
Yeah, I wasn't really
trying so hard

623
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,000
to make sure you didn't.

624
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,625
Why'd you get out of bed?

625
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,166
Did that upset you?

626
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:04,500
No, of course not.

627
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,375
Why'd you tell her
I was in the bed with you?

628
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:13,458
- Why?
- Yeah.

629
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:16,625
I don't know.
I didn't really feel

630
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,708
like I needed to hide it.

631
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:20,291
But you had plans
with her tonight

632
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,083
and you knew
it was gonna upset her.

633
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:26,791
Okay.

634
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:33,875
Mira, um, I'm sorry that
that happened that way.

635
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,250
Can we forget about it?

636
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,625
Okay?

637
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,791
- What?
- Nothing.

638
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,833
I don't... It's just a shame.

639
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,958
It sounded pretty serious,
right?

640
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,208
I don't know, I mean, anyway,

641
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:57,958
it's not really relevant
anymore, is it?

642
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,083
I don't know about that.
I mean, it's not unforgivable,

643
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:05,250
so I'm...
I'm sure she'll understand.

644
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:15,583
Fuck.

645
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,875
You haven't lost your talent
for saying the wrong thing

646
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:29,541
at the wrong time, that's...
that's for sure.

647
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:36,375
It's just I, uh,
felt a little sad, you know?

648
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,916
- I felt sad for you.
- Yeah. Oh, that's sweet.

649
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,208
How about you snap out of it,
okay?

650
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,625
'Cause you're not
my couples counselor.

651
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,458
Well, I just think it's a shame
to give up on something

652
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,208
over a couple texts... Enough!

653
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,333
Enough!

654
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,083
Can I just say something
to you, Mira?

655
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,666
Truthfully...

656
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,791
I'm not buying your whole
"ode to solitude" thing.

657
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,708
Okay? It's bullshit.

658
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,000
And I don't believe
that you believe in it.

659
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:21,041
It's a weakness. It's fear.
It's not strength.

660
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,416
And I don't know what's gonna
happen to you if you can't...

661
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,666
I'm not... I'm not trying
to be patronizing,

662
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:31,041
but I can see that your chaos
and your detachment...

663
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,958
your total detachment and...

664
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,291
I remember how...
how we were back then

665
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,208
before we moved in together

666
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,083
and what we saved
ourselves from.

667
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,500
How we pulled each other
out of exactly...

668
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:59,041
exactly that loneliness
that you're talking about.

669
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:05,250
It wasn't an illusion,
and you know it.

670
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,625
It was a miracle.

671
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:13,625
It was like the biggest
miracle of our lives.

672
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,458
And we're just like throwing
it all away.

673
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,750
And it's... it's...

674
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,583
It's just, like,
it's a terrible mistake.

675
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,083
It's terrible. And...

676
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:33,666
We should... I don't know.

677
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,833
We should've just
done everything we could to...

678
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:38,750
to...

679
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:42,541
save it, to not just give up.

680
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,041
I can't, uh...

681
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,458
I don't know how to...

682
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,458
I'm really nauseous.

683
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,958
Something is fucked up with me.

684
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,625
Something inside
is so fucked up.

685
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,875
Can I play you something?

686
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,583
Play something?

687
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:51,250
Yeah. It's...

688
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,375
It's a voice-mail
I got this morning.

689
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,375
Just hold on a second.

690
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,958
<i>Hey, Jonathan. It's Poli.</i>

691
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,458
<i>Um, I'm in the airport</i>
<i>right now,</i>

692
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,500
<i>I'm going for a week, so, uh...</i>

693
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,875
<i>uh, listen...</i>

694
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:13,416
<i>I know that Mira is going to</i>
<i>meet you tonight, okay?</i>

695
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,708
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you're going to do together.</i>

696
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:18,750
<i>It's a free country,</i>
<i>you're still married,</i>

697
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,666
<i>legally, so...</i>

698
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,500
<i>I'm just saying,</i>

699
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:26,125
<i>this whole fucking</i>
<i>situation here...</i>

700
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:30,291
<i>The suspicions and, uh,</i>
<i>the fights and all that...</i>

701
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,750
<i>It... it's just not for me.</i>

702
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,416
<i>You two sit together, talk,</i>

703
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,750
<i>decide what you wanna do</i>
<i>with each other.</i>

704
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,500
<i>I had enough.</i>

705
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:42,458
<i>Uh, if she wants to come back</i>
<i>to you, believe me,</i>

706
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,708
<i>I'm the last person to stop her,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

707
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,958
<i>And you can share this with Mira</i>
<i>if you want.</i>

708
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:50,750
<i>She probably told you</i>
<i>everything anyway, so...</i>

709
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,250
<i>- just, uh, keep me posted.</i>
- Ava. Hey!

710
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,583
- Hi, babe!
- Where's Poli?

711
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,791
Poli? Um... Poli's not here.

712
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,583
We're at Daddy's house, honey.

713
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:03,291
But I'm hungry, and I want
Poli to make me pancakes.

714
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,958
Sweetie, we don't eat
in the middle of the night.

715
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:07,250
- Okay? Come here.
- But Poli lets me.

716
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah? Does he?

717
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,666
Well, you know what?
Let's go lay down

718
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,000
and we'll try to sleep,

719
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,000
and if you're still hungry,
we'll make a snack. Okay, honey?

720
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,000
All right?

721
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,333
But can I sleep
in your bed, Mommy?

722
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,166
Oh, my... Tomorrow you can.

723
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,541
- Promise, tomorrow.
- Come on. Let's go lie down.

724
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,166
I'll lie down next to you,
all right?

725
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,916
Come give Mommy
a big good night kiss.

726
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,000
Love you.

727
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,541
All right. Let's go.

728
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,833
One second, all right?

729
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:36,083
Sure.

730
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah, just... There we go.

731
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,458
All right.

732
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:45,166
'Bout I sing you
a little dream song?

733
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,041
I don't wanna go to sleep yet.

734
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,708
Of course
you don't wanna go to sleep yet.

735
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:53,250
We're not gonna go to sleep,
okay?

736
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,750
I'm just gonna sing a song.

737
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,083
- Okay.
- Stay awake.
