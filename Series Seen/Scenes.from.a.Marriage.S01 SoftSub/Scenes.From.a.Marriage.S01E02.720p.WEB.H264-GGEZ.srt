with your own anger,
you didn't even notice.

What? What-- what--
what did I not notice?

340
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,125
That I was miserable.

talked about it.

The abortion? We...

344
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,916
we talked about it for days.
We...

-It's what you wanted.
-I know.

346
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,208
I thought that it was going
to protect what we had.

347
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,916
It was for us.

that I was in bad shape,

349
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,166
so she took me to dinner,
she set me straight.

350
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,375
She was like,
"Who has an abortion

351
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,583

352

an abortion to save it?"

00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,750
I was terrified
that if I had another kid...

00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,625
then I could never leave.

00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,791
I had a crazy thought
the other night where I just...

399
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,125
I thought of checking
my own pulse

400

to see if I was still alive.

like you can't breathe.

I'm just thinking...

410

"Is this it?" It's like...

411
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Is this all I'm gonna have?
Just like...

412
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,083
