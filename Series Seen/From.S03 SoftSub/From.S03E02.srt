What did you say?

children locked in the tower,

that if I saved them,
then maybe I could...

273
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,298
I could somehow help my daughter
from what she's going through,

274

You did the only thing
you could do.

is fucking rigged.

maybe we should go see Kristi,
uh, just as a precaution.

I go see if Kristi

can just come up here,

00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,538
You're not sleeping.
You're barely eating.

356
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,751
Fatima?

357
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,426
Fatima? Hey, look, come on.
What's going on?

358
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,552
[crunching]

359
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,272
Fatima, you're scaring me.
Come on.

360
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,900
Can you please open the door?

361
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,319
[door creaks]

362
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:24,367
Uh, I think you're right.
Maybe we should go see Kristi.

363
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,040
Kristi? You here?

364
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,419
Wait here.

365
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,420
Hello?

366
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,671
[Marielle] Coming.

367
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,758
- Hey.
- Is Kristi here?

368
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,761
Uh, she's...
She's down in town.

369
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,930
She's taking the news
about Tian-Chen pretty hard.

370
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,932
Listen, this can totally wait.

371
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,809
- The poor woman...
- No, it really can't.

372
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,644
Come on in.
I'll take a look at you.

373
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,899
You know what?
Maybe we should wait for Kristi.

374
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,444
Kristi's dealing
with a lot right now.

375
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,363
Yeah, but...

376
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,408
Look, no offense.
You're not a doctor.

377
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,784
I am, however,
a pediatric nurse.

378
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,037
So, as far as pregnancy goes,

379
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,123
I've pretty much seen
everything.

380
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,000
Come on. Come.

381
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,674
Kinda cold out for a swim.

382
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,971
What are you doing out here?

383
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,682
I just realized that...

384
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,101
I can't even remember
whose truck this was.

385
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,438
That's how many people we...

386
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,109
Danny.

387
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,904
And his, um...
his girlfriend Shay.

388
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,072
Right.

389
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,948
Danny and Shay.

390
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,869
They were good kids, yeah.

391
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,085
What happened last night, it...

392
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,711
wasn't your fault.

393
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,422
You know,
with all due respect, Kristi,

394
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,509
I'm... not here
for a pep talk.

395
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,385
All due respect, Boyd,
I don't really give a shit.

396
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,137
[sighs]

397
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,889
Look, after what happened
with Sara,

398
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,600
when she tried to hurt Ethan...

399
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,685
you sat with me in that diner

400
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,395
and you told me
it wasn't my fault,

401
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,564
that it was this place,

402
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,192
that I had saved a lot of lives,
and that I was gonna save

403
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,821
a hell of a lot more by the time
this all was finished.

404
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,531
So, was that just
a bunch of bullshit

405
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,408
to make me feel better,
or did you mean it?

406
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,204
[stammers]

407
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:38,000
Hey. This isn't your fault.
Okay?

408
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,798
Now, come on.
Let's go get you cleaned up.

409
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:44,924
[Kenny] Guys!

410
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,802
Hey! We found food!

411
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,054
Look! Look at this!

412
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,640
There's a... there's a lake,
and it's got everything.

413
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,225
It's got vegetables...

414
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,935
[Jim] We found food!

415
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,563
All right.

416
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,693
There's, uh, there's potatoes.

417
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,445
There might even be
fish in the water!

418
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,741
What's going on?

419
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,994
[indistinct murmurs]

420
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,083
Where are my kids?

421
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,751
They're fine.

422
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,170
They're...
they're okay.

423
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,881
Whose blood is that?

424
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,549
Kenny...

425
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,636
Where's...

426
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,599
Wait. Where's...

427
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,058
Where's my mom?

428
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,768
Kenny, maybe we
should go inside.

429
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:39,979
Kenny!

430
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,480
Mom?

431
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,655
Ma!

432
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,619
Mom! [shouting in Cantonese]

433
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,163
- Hey, Kenny...
- Stop! No, no, no, no, no.

434
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,875
[shouting in Cantonese]

435
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,793
- Hey, bud. Ken?
- No, stop!

436
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:03,878
- Bud, I'm...
- No.

437
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,880
- ...so s...
- Stop, stop. No! No, no!

438
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,591
- Listen, I'm so...
- No, no! Stop! Just... just stop.

439
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,800
Okay.

440
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,054
[Kenny] Okay?
[breathing rapidly]

441
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,687
Okay. Yeah.

442
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:25,107
[breathing deeply]

443
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,776
I got it.

444
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,736
[murmuring continues]

445
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,041
[door creaks]

446
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,253
I'm so sorry. I'm so...

447
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,047
I'm so sorry.

448
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,218
- [door closes]
- [sobbing]

449
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,303
Kenny, hey.

450
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,348
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. I'm okay.

451
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,183
I'm okay. I'm okay.

452
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,060
[inhaling, exhaling sharply]

453
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,110
I'm okay.

454
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,154
I'm okay.

455
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,032
[exhaling sharply] I'm okay.

456
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,162
Where is she?

457
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,873
In the church.

458
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,001
[breathing shakily]

459
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,052
I just, uh...

460
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,181
I just... I need to
sit here for a minute.

461
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,766
'Kay?

462
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,351
Yeah. Okay.

463
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,944
When was the last time you ate?

464
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:55,156
Uh, three... four days?

465
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,741
She can't keep anything down.

466
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,743
I've tried to.

467
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,078
It's just even
the smell of food,

468
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,331
it's just...

469
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,207
- [exhales deeply]
- Deep breath.

470
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,004
Look, are you sure we
shouldn't just get Kristi?

471
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,006
- Ellis, just...
- How've you been doing

472
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,341
since, you know...

473
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,885
Since what?

474
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,845
Since I went through withdrawal,

475
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,849
or since this place...
mind-raped me?

476
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,065
Look, I know this is scary,

477
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,359
and if it's any consolation,

478
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,694
you're doing exactly what
you're supposed to be doing.

479
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:37,156
In the tradition of
first-time fathers everywhere,

480
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,824
you're scared out of your mind,

481
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,661
and you're asking every
question you possibly can.

482
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,790
As for you,
you're severely malnourished.

483
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,917
It's a wonder
only one tooth fell out.

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,961
You also may have something
called hyperemesis gravidarum.

485
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,922
What is that? Is that bad?

486
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,966
It's essentially really
bad morning sickness.

487
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,135
We really just need
to get you eating again.

488
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,680
[sighs] Well, you tell that
to the world's pickiest eater.

489
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,058
[chuckles] I'm gonna see if
maybe we have something

490
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,893
that can settle your stomach.

491
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,978
But as far as the baby?

492
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,147
- Everything's okay?
- As far as I can tell,

493
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,441
everything's fine.

494
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,860
- I'll be right back.
- [sighs]

495
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:23,369
Ah, you see?
I told you.

496
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,080
- Everything is okay.
- Was that you?

497
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,790
- Yeah.
- That was... that was you?

498
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,875
Yeah, yeah,
it was totally me, you know,

499
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:33,796
calm, cool, collected.

500
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,007
Yeah. Might have missed that.

501
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,510
[sighs]

502
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:43,472
You hear that in there?
Everything's gonna be okay.

503
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,357
Whenever things got
really bad here, she'd...

504
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,903
...she used to always say...

505
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,951
"No matter how bad it gets,

506
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,744
we'll never
have this day again."

507
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,958
She'd always repeat it

508
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,086
to make sure I got the message.

509
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,422
[speaking Cantonese]

510
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,438
Did she...

511
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,316
Did she suffer?

512
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,444
- Kenny, I...
- No, I...

513
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,780
It's okay. You don't have to...
[sniffles]

514
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,037
[sighs]

515
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,122
Have you seen her?

516
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,291
Have you seen what
they did to her?

517
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,959
Not yet, no.

518
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,047
Whenever I think about my dad...

519
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,968
I can't...

520
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:06,055
All I can see is him
lying there in that basement.

521
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,936
I can't think of him
and not see him like that.

522
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,022
I don't want it
to be like that for her.

523
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,482
[sniffles]

524
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,983
Can you do me a favor?

525
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,989
Yeah, of course.

526
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,826
Can you... [sighs]

527
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,454
[sniffling]
Can you make her...

528
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,999
Can you make her look like her?

529
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,043
Can you make sure
she looks nice?

530
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,003
She would be really upset,

531
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,382
if she, uh... [sniffles]

532
