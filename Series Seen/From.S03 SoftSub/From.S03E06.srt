[Boyd] <i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:20,837
- Get them off me!
- Are you looking for these?

3
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,506
Take them.
We get to keep Randall, though.

4
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:27,260
We're gonna need
some fresh towels!

5
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,011
- No, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey. Stop!

6
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,140
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- You fucking left me!

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,062
Ellis, he's so happy.

8
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:41,149
I can't tell him
how scared I am.

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,276
I'm trying to be patient,
but I-I need...

10
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,486
- You can't help!
- I don't understand.

11
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,071
This!

12
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,447
- It's all I can keep down!
- What?

13
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,826
I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

14
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,830
- What's wrong?
- Nothing for Christopher.

15
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,248
[Sara] Who was Christopher?

16
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,875
[Victor] He was our friend.

17
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:01,419
But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,045
and then everyone died.

19
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,589
[screams]

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,593
Jasper's the one who can
tell us why it happened.

21
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:11,262
Easier to tell myself
they were dead.

22
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:13,347
All that time,
my little boy was here.

23
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,601
What kind of man
gives up on his family?

24
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,396
Victor.

25
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,232
I didn't know how to get home.

26
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,402
What the hell
happened last night?

27
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:27,445
Boyd?

28
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:28,863
Tabitha's back.

29
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,114
What?

30
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:31,616
Boyd said you went
through a tree?

31
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,492
They're called Farway trees.

32
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,912
Can you get back there
without the tree?

33
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,580
I don't know.
I don't... I don't know.

34
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,081
What about the bottles?
Was there anything

35
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,167
- special about them?
- I took a few of 'em down.

36
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,668
There were slips of paper inside

37
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,420
with numbers written on them.

38
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,131
When you were out there,
did you contact anyone?

39
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,467
You don't understand,
they wouldn't have believed me.

40
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:52,053
You had an opportunity that
none of us have ever had before,

41
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:53,429
and you blew it.

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,306
I went out and I came back.

43
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:57,226
- And I came back with nothing!
- We thought you were dead.

44
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,062
Your children thought
you were dead.

45
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:02,940
You owe it to your kids
to be here now.

46
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:13,492
[breathing restlessly]

47
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:18,705
What are you doing?

48
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,625
I had a nightmare.

49
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:25,086
[sighs]

50
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,921
You wanna talk about it?

51
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,506
No.

52
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,800
Well, come back to bed.

53
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,428
[sighs]

54
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,349
I should've done more.

55
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,310
When I was out there,
I should've done more.

56
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,438
[exhales]

57
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:02,832
You did the best you could.

58
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,126
How do you know that?

59
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,919
What?

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,672
You keep saying stuff like that.
How do you know?

61
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,008
How do you have any idea
what I could've done?

62
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,051
I'm just...

63
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,761
You keep saying stuff like that,

64
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,847
just... that is not true,
just so I feel better.

65
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:20,599
I don't... I don't understand.

66
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,768
[sighs]

67
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,812
Would you... would you rather
I just picked you apart?

68
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,022
[sighs]

69
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,190
Make you feel like shit?

70
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:30,234
I'm not gonna do that.

71
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,778
I just want you to be honest!

72
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,239
No.

73
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:38,409
What you want

74
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,995
is for me to read your mind,

75
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,997
so I can say to you
whatever you wanna hear

76
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:45,041
at any given time.

77
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,251
You want me to be the bad guy?

78
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:51,088
Fine! But I was the one
who stayed here,

79
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:54,091
holding our kids together,
while you ran off

80
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:55,843
- to try to deal with whatever...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

81
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,219
- ...it was you were doing!
- You make it sound like

82
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,471
I went on a fucking vacation.

83
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,181
I came to you.

84
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:01,640
I asked for your
fucking permission.

85
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,684
I was just trying
to save our daughter.

86
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:05,102
Did it ever occur
to you that maybe

87
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,313
we could've
done things together?

88
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,607
No! Because you wanted
to do it on your own!

89
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,484
You want to do
everything on your own!

90
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,651
That's why you...

91
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,362
That's why what?

92
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:15,322
- No.
- That's why what?

93
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,947
Nothing.

94
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:18,783
Noth... that's why what?

95
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:20,993
I'm going back to bed.

96
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,372
Stop being a fucking
coward and tell me!

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,334
That's why you wanted a divorce,

98
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,379
because it'd be easier
for you to cut and run,

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,382
to deal with Thomas's
death on your own,

100
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:37,593
instead of trying
to put our family back together!

101
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,346
Oh, yeah and you were the knight
in shining armor, right?

102
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,474
Everything you did, every choice
you made was perfect!

103
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:45,684
- I never said that.
- You think getting the divorce

104
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,353
was gonna let me
deal with it on my own?

105
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,813
I was already on my fucking own!

106
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,022
Oh, that's so not true.

107
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,066
You got to throw
yourself into your work!

108
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,443
You were not there when Julie
and Ethan woke up crying.

109
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,237
You didn't see them

110
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:58,239
sitting in Thomas's room,
just staring at his toys...

111
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,323
No.

112
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:00,950
And you're upset.

113
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,743
You're upset because you had to

114
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:06,038
take care of your children
the few days that I was gone?

115
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,624
I took care of my fucking kids
for a year, while you were...

116
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,209
- No! God...
- ...I don't know fucking what.

117
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,089
- Damn it, no!

You slept late.

148
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:45,615
Where's Dad?

149
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,702
Um, he went to the lake
with some people

150
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,245
to get the rest of the food.

151
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:52,746
He left?

152
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,915
Yeah.
He's coming back tomorrow.

153
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,543
Go tell Ethan
I'm making breakfast.

154
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,505
So we're just taking
day trips to the lake now?

155
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,674
Honey, the people need the food.

156
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,509
Right.

157
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,554
And it had nothing to do with
that screaming match last night?

158
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,392
I'm sorry you heard that.

159
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,437
I'm pretty sure people
in Colony House heard.

160
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:17,563
Listen, Julie...

161
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,940
No. I get it.

162
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,026
I've heard this speech
plenty of times.

[exhales]

164
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,573
I'm just glad some things are
finally getting back to normal.

165
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,700
I'll get Ethan.

166
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:46,216
[Boyd] So you're saying
this could be some kind of code?

167
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:49,553
Yeah, or an algorithm,
or... who knows?

168
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,348
Look, the fact is, Tabitha got
pushed out of a lighthouse

169
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,684
and somehow ended up near
a hiking trail in Camden, Maine.

170
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,686
I don't think I'm being
controversial when I say,

171
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,146
by all known metrics,

172
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,272
that's impossible.

173
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,441
- Okay.
- Unless... Unless...

174
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:06,195
she experienced some kind
of... quantum event.

175
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:09,239
Right? Or wormhole, or any
number of theoretical events

176
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,742
that would allow her to get from
the lighthouse in the woods

177
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,869
to Camden, Maine.

178
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,914
Or maybe...

179
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:19,917
Maybe the lighthouse in the
woods occupies the same space

180
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,669
as Camden, Maine.

181
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,338
Maybe it wasn't a wormhole
so much as a dimensional rift!

182
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,799
- Jade.
- I can understand an awful lot

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,342
of people get confused,
but the truth is

184
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:30,386
a wormhole is a shortcut
through space and time.

185
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,262
- Whereas a dimensional rift...
- Jade, stop!

186
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,556
Sorry. What?

187
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:37,185
I thought you said you had
something exciting to show me.

188
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,312
Yeah.

189
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,564
All right,
okay, okay, listen, listen.

190
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,984
I understand why
you might be skeptical.

191
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,695
I am too.

192
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:53,033
Something tells me that
this has to mean something.

193
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:56,578
The bottle tree was
important to Miranda, right?

194
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,997
And according to Tabitha,
she's the only one

195
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,333
who had a connection to this
place long before she arrived.

196
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,211
Did you look at the bottles
from the other tree?

197
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,172
What other tree?
The one in Maine?

198
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,799
- No. How could I...?
- No, the one...

199
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,759
[sighs]
Sara and I found

200
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,053
one of these trees when we went
out into the woods together.

201
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,638
It wasn't a portal tree,

202
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,224
but it still had
bottles hanging from it,

203
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,684
messages inside.

204
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:23,230
I pulled one down,
it said... "1864."

205
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,773
1864.

206
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:27,110
Eighteen. Eighteen six...

207
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,322
I saw it.
[muttering]

208
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:33,491
Uh...

209
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,747
"1864."

210
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:45,461
Where's the second tree?

211
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:48,339
[wheel creaking]

212
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:53,969
[footsteps approaching]

213
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,972
Hey. Sorry.

214
00:10:56,973 --> 00:11:01,060
I was looking for you
and I just figured I'd wait.

215
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,354
Okay.

216
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:11,069
I haven't seen
one of these in a long time.

217
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,989
Yeah. That belonged
to Mrs. Davis.

218
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,407
Is that right?

219
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,077
What was Mrs. Davis doing
with one of these?

220
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,330
She bought it for her son,

221
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,956
he was very sick,

222
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,125
and he saw the car
in the back of a magazine.

223
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,670
And so, she drove far away

224
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,298
to buy one from the only store

225
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,551
that still sold them.

226
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,971
- [tin rattling]
- Uh...

227
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,098
She...

228
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,226
She said her son
didn't have very long,

229
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:46,188
and she knew that
the car would make him...

230
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:47,357
smile.

231
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,613
She saw the tree
before she got home.

232
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,951
And she died a long time ago.

233
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,121
I guess her son is dead too.

234
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,587
Yeah, I was thinking maybe

235
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:12,674
you could show me around today.

236
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,844
Uh, there's something
I have to do.

237
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,680
It's very important.

238
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:22,808
Oh. Mind if I tag along?

239
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,603
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

240
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:28,147
Right.

241
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:33,777
Well, I'll...
I'll just get out of your way.

242
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:36,321
Uh...
[exhaling sharply]

243
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,533
Uh, it's...

244
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:41,827
very... dangerous,

245
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,954
what I have to do, and I...

246
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:46,374
and I don't want
you to get hurt.

247
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:57,135
But you could walk with me
for a bit, if you want.

248
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:01,013
All right. I'd like that.

249
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,432
Okay.

250
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,612
I, uh, finished
cleaning out the ambulance.

251
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:17,863
Here's the last of it.

252
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,198
Awesome. Thanks.

253
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,993
Oh, this stuff is
gonna be a godsend.

254
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:24,703
I'm gonna bring this downstairs.

255
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,246
Oh, I can give you a hand.

256
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,832
You've done plenty, really.

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,459
You should go home,

258
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,877
get some rest.

259
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,046
Thank you.

260
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:39,218
[exhales]

261
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:45,682
Coming or going?

262
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:48,101
Oh, I, uh... going.

263
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,687
You okay?

264
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,565
Yeah. You know, I...

265
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,775
I'm good.

266
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:56,860
Yeah.

267
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,029
- Kenny...
- I'm good.

268
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,239
I'm good, really.

269
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,659
I don't wanna
talk about it right now.

270
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,369
Okay. Yeah.

271
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,537
Yeah.

272
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:18,883
[grunting in pain]

273
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,892
[groaning]

274
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:33,230
[breathing heavily]

275
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,482
[groans]

276
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,501
[Kristi]
Boyd!

277
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,337
Shouldn't you be in bed?

278
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:59,673
I don't think you're one
to talk about taking it easy.

279
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,634
Well...

280
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:04,178
He's doing better.

281
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,140
Yeah. Yeah. I was...

282
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,684
I was just, uh...

283
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:14,021
Hey, that ambulance
came in fully stocked.

284
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:16,523
There was a portable
ultrasound onboard.

285
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:17,899
Really?

286
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,901
Yeah.
When you see Fatima,

287
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,820
tell her to come on by.

288
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,740
She can take a look
at her little nugget.

289
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,908
I'll do that.

290
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:30,203
Hey, look, don't mention
that I came by, okay?

291
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:31,788
Yeah, of course.

292
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,373
Right.

293
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:35,417
That's really good news,
the ultrasound.

294
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:36,753
Yeah.

295
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,472
Say something.

296
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,602
We have to go to Kristi.

297
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,065
No.
I can't do that.

298
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:04,279
I mean, there's gotta be some
sort of medical explanation.

299
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,907
How can there be?

300
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:10,160
Look, I don't...

301
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:12,037
I don't want
everyone looking at me

302
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,498
the way that you're
looking at me right now.

303
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,375
Like you're afraid of me.

304
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,295
No, no, I am...
I am not afraid of you.

305
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:25,050
Okay? And whatever is happening
is not your fault, okay?

306
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,802
I just...

307
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,137
I just...
I just wanna help you.

308
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,889
Maybe it'll just go away.

309
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,350
You know, maybe it'll
just go away on its own.

310
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,143
- And maybe...
- Baby...

311
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,937
Maybe it'll just stop.

312
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:38,313
[knocking]

313
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,023
Who is it?

314
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,902
It's Dad.
I, uh, got some good news.

315
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,114
Just... just a second.

316
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:49,116
Just a second.

317
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,201
Hey.

318
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:54,704
Hey, look at me.

319
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:57,040
Look,
I-I am just as scared as you.

320
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,878
Okay?
But we cannot do this alone.

321
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,508
[Boyd]
If it's a bad time...

322
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,721
No, it's fine.

323
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:15,893
Okay.

324
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,650
Hey. What's...

325
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,153
[sighs]

326
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:27,905
What's going on?

327
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,703
Come in.

328
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:42,712
[grunting]

329
00:17:58,895 --> 00:17:59,937
Donna?

330
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,776
I heard about what happened.
I'm so sorry.

331
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,488
Were you two close?

332
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,199
[sighs]

333
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,828
He was a pain in my ass
for almost two years.

334
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,041
He had some
good moments, though.

335
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,667
Would have loved this;

336
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,546
me hauling these
fucking stones across town.

337
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:28,089
Only thing
he would've liked better,

338
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,674
is if I left him to rot,

339
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,801
so he could ruin everyone's
breakfast every morning.

340
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,137
[chuckling mirthlessly]

341
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:35,932
I was there
when he went through.

342
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,311
He was just trying
to help, you know?

343
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:44,856
I'm sure he had some shitty
remark on his way out.

344
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,151
[chuckles]

345
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,573
You doing okay?

346
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:55,575
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:59,162
That meeting yesterday
couldn't have been too easy.

348
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:00,498
Well, I just...

349
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,834
I just feel that...

350
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,797
everyone expects me to have
all the answers, you know?

351
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,424
I feel like I let them down.

352
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:13,468
I feel like
I let my family down.

353
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,470
Let them down?

354
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:18,683
Tabitha, your children
thought you were dead!

355
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,270
They don't need
answers from you.

356
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:25,563
They just needed you back.

357
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,691
Yeah.

358
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,740
What if the people from
the meeting were right?

359
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:38,576
What if I wasted

360
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,329
the only opportunity
we're gonna get?

361
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,249
You see Dale down there?

362
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,294
You went through that same tree.

363
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:49,713
That could have been
you down there.

364
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:51,048
I know.

365
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:55,677
Don't try to be a hero.

366
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,595
Go spend time with your kids

367
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,932
because you're lucky
to be here still.

368
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,269
Don't take that for granted.

369
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,064
I'm done.

370
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:12,028
Hey.

371
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,032
I'm sorry about your friend.

372
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:22,078
Well, back to work.

373
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,288
Yeah.

374
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,622
You, uh...

375
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,333
tell those kids of yours
I said hello.

376
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:27,835
I will.

377
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:43,099
So you... you wanna
go down into the tunnels,

378
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,934
where these things live?

379
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:48,521
I don't want to.
I have to.

380
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:51,566
Because there's
something down there

381
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,610
that is going to help people?

382
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,989
It's going to save them.
It'll save you too.

383
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,077
We're here.

384
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:08,208
You should go now.

385
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,709
Do you remember the way back?

386
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,087
I'm... I'm not going back.

387
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:13,463
I'm, uh, coming with you.

388
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:14,881
No, that's not a good idea.

389
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:17,926
No. I just got you back.

390
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,011
I'm not losing you again.

391
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,141
If you're gonna do this,
we're doing it together.

392
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:28,396
Okay.

393
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,617
What... what are
those for?

394
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,453
So we don't get lost.

395
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,710
Follow close.

396
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,465
Hey, and be really,
really quiet.

397
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:08,601
I mean, we've seen things here
that... that don't make sense.

398
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,603
And...

399
00:22:10,604 --> 00:22:15,192
these... these cravings,
maybe it's just...

400
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,779
I mean, may...
maybe it's just the effect

401
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,198
that this place has
on pregnancy,

402
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,325
so it doesn't have to mean
that there's something wrong

403
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,618
with the baby, right?

404
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,912
Right.

405
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:29,790
Right.

406
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,336
Kristi has
an ultrasound machine.

407
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:39,966
Wait. What?

408
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,136
It was on the ambulance
that came into town.

409
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:45,473
That's what I came to tell you.

410
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:55,064
No. I-I don't...
I don't... I don't wanna.

411
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:56,566
Could you give us a second?

412
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,652
Oh, yeah, of course.

413
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,113
Yeah.

414
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,885
Fatima...

415
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:25,178
Ellis, I don't want to see it.

416
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,889
No, we can't...

417
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:33,394
We cannot just hope

418
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,021
that this gets better, okay?

419
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,272
- I know.
- Okay.

420
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,066
We are in the dark.

421
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,985
I know. We'll do it tomorrow.
We'll go tomorrow.

422
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,655
Fatima, Fatima...

423
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,369
- I just want it to be okay.
- I know.

424
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,829
Hey, hey, it's okay.

425
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,373
I just want it to be okay.

426
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,625
I know, baby.

427
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:58,253
[sobbing]
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:01,298
Okay. I know.

429
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:04,009
[sobbing]

430
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:12,308
[sighs]
Good, you're awake.

431
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:15,353
The fuck do you want?

432
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,064
We need to change your bandages.

433
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,359
It's fine.

434
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,237
I need to make sure
there's no infection.

435
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:26,198
That's not something you want,
not here.

436
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,742
Fine.
I'll fuckin' change 'em.

437
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:32,036
I need you to sit up.

438
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,831
Please. Come on.

439
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:36,124
Yeah.

440
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,668
- [gasps]
- Okay, yeah.

441
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,588
[grunts]

442
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:50,472
[groans]

443
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,362
May I?

444
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:07,489
Yeah.

445
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:31,054
Well?

446
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:35,600
Um, there's
no sign of infection.

447
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,394
And the stitches are
holding well.

448
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:40,898
There's gonna be a lot of
bruising, a lot of discomfort.

449
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,277
I wanna see it.

450
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,172
Give me a minute?

451
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:10,344
Yeah, take your time.

452
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,874
[breathing unsteadily]

453
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:07,650
Hey.

454
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,694
[chuckles]
What are you doing?

455
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,114
You're not gonna
tell my parents, are you?

456
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,784
If you get caught,
I was never here.

457
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,411
- Deal.
- Okay.

458
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:19,620
You want some?

459
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,540
Don't push it.

460
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,542
Hey, I was... I was looking
for the screwdriver.

461
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,545
My mom always kept
a junk drawer in the kitchen.

462
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,797
Um, yeah.

463
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,549
My dad gets fidgety
when he's nervous,

464
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,218
so he probably
just moved stuff around.

465
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,888
Oh. Um, okay.

466
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,265
Um, God, no, I... I'm sorry.

467
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,726
With my mom being gone,
he probably didn't even realize.

468
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,895
No, it's fine. It's just a...
it's just a junk drawer.

469
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:48,232
It's not a big deal, seriously.

471
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,694
Um, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna
go check the dining room.

472
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:56,449
You just keep
that under wraps. 'Kay?

473
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,701
Okay.

474
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,997
Oh God.
[sighs]

475
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,491
[whispering]
How much further?

476
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:40,159
Shh!

477
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,495
This way.

478
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,920
[gasps]

479
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:56,885
No, he...

480
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,555
He should be here.

481
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:02,140
This is where I saw him.

482
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,729
This whole chamber was full.

483
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,064
Now it's not.

484
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,108
Maybe we took a wrong turn.

485
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:13,985
No.

486
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,320
Jasper,
he was sitting right here.

487
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:21,242
There was a clock
and a wheelchair.

488
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:24,579
And the bad things,
they were sleeping.

489
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,206
Hey, maybe we should go back.

490
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,666
You can get your bearings.

491
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,085
I know where I am.

492
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,087
We need to go deeper.

493
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:34,714
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

494
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:36,592
- We can't leave without Jasper.
- Victor.

495
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,803
It's important.

496
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,265
We'll be okay.

497
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,565
This way.

498
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,360
[door opening]

499
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,910
She's coming.

500
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:08,165
She just, uh...

501
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,793
She just needs a minute.

502
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,385
[Elgin] Thanks.

503
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:25,181
Hey, smile.

504
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:28,267
What?

505
00:30:28,268 --> 00:30:30,061
Me and Julie found this
in the basement.

506
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,354
I figured we should put together

507
00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:33,022
a little
Colony House photo album.

508
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:35,608
Doesn't have to all
be scary and bad.

509
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,902
Okay.

510
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:41,072
I'm gonna put
a collage on the wall,

511
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,824
if you wanna check it out later.

512
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,369
[door opening]

513
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:57,798
You ready?

514
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,054
I don't wanna say anything...

515
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:07,348
to Kristi,

516
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,392
not until we have to.

517
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:11,978
Okay.

518
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,146
You're coming, right?

519
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,400
Whatever you guys need.

520
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:21,697
All right.

521
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,455
[birds squawking]

522
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:39,089
[exhales]

523
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:43,259
Great.
[sighs]

524
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,844
[Tom] And then there were two.

525
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:47,305
Oh, for fuck's sake!
[sighs]

526
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,936
It's ironic, no?

527
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:56,814
A drunk looking for answers
in a tree filled with bottles.

528
00:31:56,815 --> 00:32:00,026
[chuckles]

529
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:03,529
Why... why are
you wiping that glass?

530
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,741
A man does what a man does.

531
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:13,164
So, you really think this is
gonna tell you anything?

532
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,291
I think this place has a design.

533
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,001
Ah.

534
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,670
I don't think
anything's here by accident.

535
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,341
Maybe that's your problem.

536
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:29,014
And what, dead Tom,
does that mean?

537
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:35,061
Well, nature has a design, Jade,

538
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:37,731
and that is not nature.

539
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:41,317
It's just something
