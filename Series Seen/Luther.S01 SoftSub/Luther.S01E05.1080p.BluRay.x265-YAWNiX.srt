1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,560
- Cheers.
- See you later, mate.

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,040
How you doing in there?

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,840
I'll be fine. Did they go?

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Mmm-hmm, all gone.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
I had to.

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,840
Mmm.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,480
You sure you've got the passports?

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,320
I've got the passports.

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,440
Show me the passports.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,880
Oh!

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,240
I don't believe it.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Did you give them a tip?

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,320
Yeah, I gave them a tip.

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
No, this is a different lot.

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
Sure.

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,200
On the floor! Floor now!

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,880
Shut up! I said shut up.

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
Don't move.

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,240
James Carrodus.

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
Dealer of fine art.

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Quite the reputation,

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
but not above the odd
privately brokered deal,

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,800
selling fakes to Russian billionaires
who don't know any better, huh?

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,840
And this cash,
James, was liquefied in the form

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
of 18 cut diamonds
of outstanding quality.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,520
'Cause that's the best way
to carry serious wealth, am I right?

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,640
Now you're off
to start a new life in Rio

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,480
with your beautiful bride, Jessica.

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,520
The limousine arrives in,
what, James? 15 minutes?

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
- Ten.
- Ten.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,480
In 10 minutes,
you could both be in that limo.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
All I need you to do
is give me those diamonds.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,480
I don't have them.

34
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,160
Okay.

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
Okay.

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,000
There's nothing.

37
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,320
You go get me those diamonds, James.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
In two hours. Let's call at 10:15.

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,280
I've got those 18 diamonds in my hand

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,880
or we start cutting
the lovely Jessica here.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
All right. All right.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,560
At this point, I'm sure you're asking
yourself, "Is he bluffing?"

43
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
I know you'll appreciate,

44
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
that it's in my best interest
to prove that I'm not.

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Apologies in advance, Jessica.

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,376
You don't... You don't have to do this.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,840
- No, no, no. No, please!
- Look you don't have to...

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,680
- I'll get you the...
- No!

Guyv.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,000
Justin.

57
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,480
Hello, sir. Can I help?

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,240
Ian Reed?

59
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,120
I need to see Ian Reed.

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,520
Er, I'm afraid DCI Reed is elsewhere.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm DCI John Luther.

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
I share an office with Mr Reed.

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,520
This is DS Ripley.
Can I help you? Come on.

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,520
It's her tongue.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
You sure you want to play it this way,
Dan? It's pretty hardcore.

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
The police, they get involved.
Kidnap, it's going to be.

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Did you just use my name
in front of the victim, Tom?

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,120
James, the fact of it is

69
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
most kidnappings don't come
to our attention

70
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
because when it comes to family members,

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,840
people pay up pretty fast.

72
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
You think I don't want to do that?

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,600
You think I don't want to give them what
they asked for and get my wife back?

74
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
- Do you think that?
- James,

75
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,480
I just need to understand
what's happening.

76
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,480
I came to see you because
I haven't got what they want.

77
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,840
And I've no way of getting it.

78
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you saying?

79
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Jessica swallowed them.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,760
The diamonds are inside her right now.

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,680
If I'd have told them that,
they'd have cut her open on the spot.

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,360
Sorry.

83
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
Oh, yeah, well, that's,
er, Bill Winingham.

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
He sent Carrodus directly to you.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
- Oh, yeah?
- How well do you know him?

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,856
Yeah, pretty well.
He's a money launderer, basically.

87
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,480
Bit of a gent, as it goes.

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,240
Never involved
in any bloodshed, not to my knowledge.

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,400
Right, thing is, he was the one
that procured the diamonds

90
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
for Carrodus in the first place

91
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,320
and he's the only third party
to know that they even exist.

92
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
So if anyone set this up,
I think he's our man.

93
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,560
Turns out, no one's seen
Winingham for three or four days.

94
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,760
So we can't find our sole lead?

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,560
No. And the kidnappers
want their ransom in just over an hour.

96
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,360
You think they'll make good
on their threat?

97
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Absolutely.

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,080
Um, listen, Bill knows me,
so do his friends and family.

99
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,976
Do you want me to go out
there, see if I can round him up,

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,256
find out what the hell's going on?

101
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah, see if you can do that.

102
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,080
So, they won't give us what we want.

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,280
We can't give them what they want.

104
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,320
No, we can't give it to them,
but we can lend it to them.

105
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,640
Meaning?

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,920
- Let's visit the evidence safe.
- Don't want to hear it.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Boss, these are
very special circumstances.

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,440
Same rules do not apply.

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Chain of evidence
is like the Ten Commandments.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,680
It applies unto time and all eternal.

111
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Anything in the evidence
safe is sacrosanct.

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,880
We tamper, we risk voiding active cases.

113
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
Only if we get found out.

114
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
Am I actually having this conversation?

115
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,720
Are you actually saying this to me?

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
Boss, listen.

117
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,320
Listen to me carefully. If we do not
have any security to play with,

118
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,840
then Jessica dies.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
- If I start stealing evidence...
- Borrowing.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,720
If I start borrowing evidence
to use for my own purposes...

121
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,560
It won't be out of my sight
for a second.

122
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,296
Of course I understand.
He's your husband.

123
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,520
Oh, no. He's not.

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
Let me say it. Let me get it out.

125
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,776
And then it's said. It's said and done.

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't want to ever have
this conversation again.

127
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,336
I'm gonna go away for a couple of
days and give you time to think.

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
- There's nothing to think about.
- Yes, there is.

129
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,896
And if you decide to stay with me,

130
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,240
there'll be no recrimination,
no blame, no nothing.

131
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,440
We pick up where we left off,
and we carry on.

132
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,960
- But?
- But,

133
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
you can never see him again.

134
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,560
Not ever. That means
no phone calls, no emails, no nothing.

135
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
It's necessary for me.

136
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,520
I can't let you do this
to me again. I can't.

137
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,680
- Babe.
- John.

138
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Can I see you?

139
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
Absolutely. Erm...

140
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,616
I just got a lot of stuff going on here.

141
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,480
Can I call you later?

142
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,360
Okay, but I really need to see you.
It needs to be today.

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
No, me too. All right?

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,880
Erm, I'll call you the moment
I get a chance.

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
All right.

146
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,480
How much are these worth?

147
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know, about £3.5 million.

148
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,120
I appreciate the effort, but these
people want something very specific.

149
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,400
They want 18 diamonds
of a particular size, quality and value.

150
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
That's the best we can do.

151
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,280
- It's not what they want.
- James,

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,736
I'm gonna need you to understand that

153
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,920
unless we find a way to open up lines of
communication with the kidnappers,

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
they're going to kill Jessica.

155
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,040
Not tomorrow or the next day,

156
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,880
but before this hand gets here.

157
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,080
So you will deliver these diamonds.

158
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
But you'll attach a note that says,

159
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
"Give me Jessica
and you'll get the rest.”

160
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,680
- They won't go for it.
- No, they won't go for it.

161
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,680
But we'll have given them
a good enough reason

162
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,000
to keep Jessica alive a little longer

163
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,480
and we will have made
our first contact.

164
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,200
Once we can achieve that
then we can think about the next stage.

165
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,800
Hmm.

166
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,280
Ian. It's not my fault!

167
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,520
It's not my fault.

168
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Look, we all know the rules, all right?

169
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,920
You rob a thief of stolen money,

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,416
he thinks of that as cost of business.

171
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,600
He's not going to the police,
nobody gets hurt,

172
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
no innocents are involved.

173
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,840
And that's the way these things have
worked since I was a woodentop.

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,520
Now this is kidnapping, Bill.

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,400
They took his wife.
They cut out her tongue.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh, sweet Mary.

177
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,000
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,520
All I know is that they're
supposed to call with the all-clear,

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,840
but I've heard nothing.

180
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,520
- Where are they now?
- I don't know.

181
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
No, that's not good enough.

182
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay, you need
to listen to me, all right?

183
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,736
You need to forget
about the money. The money's gone.

184
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
The money doesn't matter.
You need to tell me what you know.

185
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,040
Who did your nephew recruit for the job?

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,080
Some...

187
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,240
Some American he hooked up with over
there when he was at school.

188
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,360
He's a bright boy. He's a clever boy.

189
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,520
Some American? That's it?

190
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
I don't know where they are!

191
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,640
Bill, they are going to kill her.

192
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,040
Oh, Jesus.

193
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,560
Okay? And I can't
be responsible for her death.

194
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,960
Not because the chance to make
a few easy quid went wrong.

195
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,376
So I have to make sure she gets through
this. Do you understand me?

196
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,880
Whatever it takes, I have
to get her through this.

197
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,280
Of course.

198
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,880
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

199
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
All right, Westfield Shopping
Centre. Central Hall. 20 minutes.

200
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,920
20 minutes, er...

201
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,680
I don't think I can make it. I need...

202
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,840
Entrances and exits covered.

203
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,360
Received.

204
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,960
Echo 1 in position.

205
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,120
Echo 2 in position.

206
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Affirmed.

207
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,040
Carrodus coming into position.

208
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Eyeball on Carrodus.

209
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,040
Okay. Here we go, people.

210
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,680
What... What's this?

211
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,200
Couple of hoodies.

212
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,880
- Subject's been handed something.
- It's a note. Instructions.

213
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,960
Pick 'em up, Ripley.

214
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah, I'm there.

215
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
All right.

216
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,280
John, stay on Carrodus.

217
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm gonna move then.

218
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Visual on the coffee bar.

219
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,160
Nope. No visual.

220
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
Thank you very much.

221
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,160
Diamonds are in the bag.

222
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Received.
Benny, track the hoodies.

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
Tracking.

224
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Ah!

225
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,880
Are you getting this, Benny?

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,160
A wasp in a wheelie bin.

227
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,976
Yeah. Have uniform pick 'em up,
they're no kidnappers.

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,416
Just kids that'll have been given money
to give Carrodus that note.

229
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Well, go.

230
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Eyeball on Carrodus. Level 2.

231
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,120
What's he waiting for?

232
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm watching. Benny, what's he doing?

233
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,640
I don't know. But we don't like it.

234
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
He's made his drop.

235
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
Yeah.

236
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,120
Cover all second-floor
stairs and escalators.

237
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay, I've got an eyeball. Two live
ones. One male, one female.

238
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,640
Here we go, here we go.

239
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
Subjects approaching drop point.

240
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,480
They have the bag.

241
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,680
Son of a bitch!

242
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,800
What's wrong?

243
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
She's not happy. Something's wrong.

244
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,560
I don't know.

245
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,600
Get in closer, can you?

246
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,920
- No diamonds.
- What do you mean, no diamonds?

247
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
I mean, run the bastard down. Go! Go!

248
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Justin, if she makes
that call, Jessica's dead!

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
Don't lose him.

250
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Hey! Hey!

251
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,640
You're under arrest
for the kidnapping of Jessica Carrodus.

252
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
You do not have to say anything.

253
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,800
Benny, Benny, come on.

254
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,560
Boss, come on.

255
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,560
John, I've lost him. I'm sorry.

256
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,720
We've lost him? We've lost him.

257
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,760
Oh, shit.

258
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
Listen, I don't know
who you are or where you are.

259
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,960
You're still in control here,
so don't put the phone down.

260
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,680
Prolong the situation.

261
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,040
Ensure the safety of the hostages.

262
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,440
Foster relationship between
negotiator and hostage-taker.

263
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,960
But most importantly, keep things calm.

264
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,160
Look, I know you're no amateur.

265
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,936
All right? So I'm not going
to try and play you here.

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,400
Yeah, I will try and trace the call,

267
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,296
but it's gonna take me a
couple of minutes to get in motion.

268
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,160
By the time I do that,
you'll be long gone.

269
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,720
You've got one minute.

270
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,360
Carrodus kept the ransom.

271
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,520
He did, huh?

272
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,600
Last-minute calculation.
The way he sees it,

273
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,960
Jessica was going to die
even if he gave you the money,

274
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,200
so why give you the money?

275
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,720
Looks like we both lost him, right?

276
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,640
Look, I don't care about him.

277
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,440
I want Jessica back. That's all we want.

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,320
No, it's not. No, you want to arrest
me and send me to prison.

279
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,320
Yeah, I do want that.
But that's not an outcome I can expect,

280
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,440
not right now,
not given the circumstances.

281
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,360
So I'm going to go for plan B,

282
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,680
right, which is get Jessica back alive.

283
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
What's your name?

284
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,320
John. But don't doubt
that I can get you what you want.

285
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,480
I just... Just give me three hours.

286
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,160
I tell you what,

287
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,240
you give me a number
and I'll call you on it in one hour.

288
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
- I'll need proof of life.
- You won't get it, John.

289
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,000
You see, this is a game
of trust now, John.

290
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,136
Do you think you can manage that?

291
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,840
All right, take this number down.

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,560
Uncle Bill, it's gone bad.

293
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,800
What do you mean?

294
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,040
There's no ransom.

295
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,600
There's hot and cold running police.

296
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
- Shit.
- What?

297
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,280
They've nicked Evie. Daniel's lost it.

298
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,400
If I go back to him empty-handed,
no diamonds, no Evie, right, that's it.

299
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,160
That's it. I've had it, I've had it.

300
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,400
Tom, I've got somebody here
that needs to talk to you.

301
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,240
Jesus, Bill, who've you got there?

302
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,960
Don't panic. He's a friend,
all right? He's a friend.

303
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Who's there?

304
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,720
Okay, Tom. You need to listen to me
now. Okay? Are you listening?

305
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
- Who are you?
- Are you listening?

306
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,200
Yes, yes! I'm listening.

307
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,400
Where are they keeping her?

308
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,896
I'm not going to tell you that, am I?

309
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,200
Okay, Tom,
you can still get out of this,

310
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,400
with the money, do you understand me?

311
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,136
No, no, look, I'm sorry, no, I don't. I
don't understand, I don't get it.

312
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
The woman, okay, the woman,
Jessica Carrodus.

313
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,840
She has the diamonds.

314
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,680
Just get her away from
wherever she's being kept.

315
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,440
Get her away safely
and you can have it all.

316
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,600
I can't!

317
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,560
If you don't do this...
If you don't do this,

318
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,160
hand to God, I'll kill you myself.

319
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Anything?

320
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,920
Not a word. No prints on record.
No nothing.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,640
You know, she may not have been
our problem up until now,

322
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
but she'll have been someone's.

323
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,440
You don't start off at kidnapping.
You work your way up to it.

324
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,160
Why don't you send her details
to Detective Munch in New York.

325
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
He's Special Victims Unit there.

326
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,240
Sir.

327
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,520
"The evidence won't leave
our sight for a second"?

328
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,720
We'll get it back.

329
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
We'd better, because right this second,

330
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,720
I'm peddling thin air
like Wile E. Coyote.

331
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,280
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,640
- Can I get five minutes?
- You can have two.

333
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,840
How are you? Good?

334
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,400
Nice to see you. Bye-bye, then.

335
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

336
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,760
I haven't seen you in here forever.

337
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,120
I know, it was a long time back.

338
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
I need a moment.

339
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,960
I can't.

340
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
It's a madhouse today.

341
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,560
Can I see you later?

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
Not really.

343
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,400
Are you really going
to do this to me today?

344
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,800
In front of everyone?

345
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,040
I can't make a scene, yeah?

346
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
‘Cause you're safer here.

347
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,296
What do you want me to do? Beg you?

348
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,416
- 'Cause I've done that.
- I don't want that. I don't want that.

349
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,760
You want... You want me to ask you why?

350
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,920
You already know why.

351
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,400
Zoe, you say that. And I... I don't.

352
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
I mean I think about it and then...

353
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,440
I really do think and just nothing.

354
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,080
I don't know why
you keep doing this to me.

355
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,096
You and me, these
last few days, it's just been...

356
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
It's just been a way
of saying goodbye properly.

357
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
And I think we both knew that deep down.

358
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,400
We knew it, didn't we?

359
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,400
Zoe.

360
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
I didn't know.

361
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
Do you know who she is?

362
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,480
Do you have any clue what she might
be going through right now?

363
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,000
Where she is?

364
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
Do you want to see her tongue?

365
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,960
‘Cause I have it somewhere
here in a napkin. Get out.

366
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
- John...
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

367
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,600
Oh! Whoa!

368
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,080
All right, back to work!

369
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,040
The clock is ticking!

370
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,320
- Did you speak to Munch?
- Er, yeah.

371
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,280
Evangeline Nixon. Long history of
violence, extortion, suspected kidnap.

372
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,800
Married to this man,
Daniel Sugarman, 36.

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,280
Even longer history.

374
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,240
Armed robbery, extortion, kidnap.
More than one murder.

375
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,600
Yeah, that's him.

376
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,040
No facial tattoo.

377
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,600
No, I bet it's fake.

378
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Just look at his face.
That's all you're going to remember.

379
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,560
- When's he due to call?
- In about four minutes.

380
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,160
Oi, Winingham?

381
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,000
No sign of him.

382
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,040
All right. All right.

383
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,280
All right. I'm here.

384
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,160
Do you have it?

385
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,320
Most of it.

386
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,920
Most of it is not what
we agreed, John. Deal's off.

387
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,080
What about Jessica?

388
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,936
You have to get
this into your head, all right?

389
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
I don't care about her.

390
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,120
If I no longer believe
her to be of sufficient value to you,

391
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,840
then her value to me
diminishes sharply. Do you understand?

392
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,280
And right now, it seems to me
that she's verging on worthless.

393
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,480
Well, okay, we've got
Evangeline. I mean, what's her value?

394
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,280
To you, Evie's an asset of very limited
benefit. I know she's safe.

395
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
I know you can't hurt her.

396
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,080
I know she's strong and won't say a damn
word about me. So keep her.

397
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,600
She's not in play here.
She's just a captured piece.

398
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,000
You bring me the money. Last chance.

399
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,160
All right, okay, I can get
£3 or £4 million.

400
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,536
But it's going to take some time.

401
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,720
You have one hour.
Plus, here's a revised deal.

402
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,280
You give me 100% of what I want,
you get back 100% of Jessica.

403
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,640
You bring me 80%
of what I want, you get 80% of Jessica.

404
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,400
And so on. You take longer than an hour,

405
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,040
you don't get to know
how she died or where I dumped her.

406
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
- All right, how long?
- Two to three minutes.

407
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,080
Make it two minutes.

408
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,200
Shh! Shh!

409
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,960
Please, Jessica. Hey, I'm trying to get
you out of here, all right?

410
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,840
I'm trying to get you home.

411
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Please.

412
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,040
I know they're inside of you.

413
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,520
If you do not let me help you,
he's gonna cut them out.

414
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,920
So, please, please help me here.

415
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,840
Thank you.

416
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
We offered Daniel a swap.

417
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,080
You for Jessica. Do you want
to know what he said?

418
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,360
We've got Evangeline,
I mean, what's her value?

419
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,520
You have to get this in your
head, all right. I don't care about her.

420
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
I no longer believe her
to be of sufficient value.

421
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Right now it seems to me
that she's verging on worthless.

422
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,840
So keep her. You bring me the money.

423
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,000
Now, I neither have the patience or the
time to feel sorry for you,

424
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,240
so this is a one-time offer.

425
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,120
You tell me where Daniel's staying and
I'll make sure you're looked after.

426
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,840
You've got 10 seconds.

427
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,080
Then after that, I walk out of that
door and you never see me again.

428
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,920
I want to serve my time in the States.

429
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,840
I can arrange that.

430
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,240
That was the burn code.

431
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,640
That means he's on his way.

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,680
- That worked.
- So what now?

433
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,880
Jessica's being held alone,

434
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,400
at worst being guarded
by a third kidnapper, Tom Meyer.

435
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,320
Come on!

436
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,120
Get down.

437
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Come on! Come on!

438
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Almost there.

439
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,800
Shit!

440
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:34,824
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
You okay?

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,400
No, I'm not.

443
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,080
Are you?

444
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,080
No.

445
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,800
Yeah, it should be.

446
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,040
What a God Almighty mess this is.

447
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,160
Have we, um, put it together?

448
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,160
Well, best guess?

449
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,280
Jessica sees Meyer as a nice guy.

450
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,296
You know, her best way out of here.

451
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,800
Classic Stockholm response.

452
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,120
So she tells him about the diamonds.

453
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,840
Meyer decides to rescue her,
maybe keep the diamonds for himself.

454
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,040
Then, just as they're leaving,
Sugarman comes back.

455
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,280
He turns on Meyer.

456
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,200
Tortures him until
he gives up what's happening.

457
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,880
So the only possible link to all this

458
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,640
is the money launderer,
Bill what's-his-name?

459
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,280
- Winingham.
- So, track him down.

460
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,240
Throw accessory to multiple
murder, kidnap, extortion.

461
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,360
In the face of that,
he'll give it up in five minutes.

462
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,240
Mate? You all right?

463
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

464
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,360
It's just, er,

465
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
what a mess, eh?

466
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,760
Yeah.

467
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,280
Erm, so, listen, do you want me
to, erm, track down Winingham?

468
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,960
Yes. And I'll go for Sugarman.

469
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,896
He'll have vanished, John.
You know that, he'll be gone.

470
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
No, he won't.

471
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,456
No, he knows we'll be
watching the airports and the ports.

472
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,840
He'll probably go underground
somewhere, lay low.

473
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,280
Are you sure you're all right?

474
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,080
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

475
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,280
You don't look it.

476
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,480
No. No.

477
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,440
Bad day.

478
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,120
Bad, bad day.

479
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,960
Your nephew's dead.

480
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,280
Sugarman cut off his fingers
and his ear.

481
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
Oh!

482
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,176
And then they gutted Jessica and they
took what was inside her.

483
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
Do you understand what I'm saying?

484
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,280
Tom only did what he did
because I told him to.

485
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,400
If I'd said nothing,
my friends would've got there in time.

486
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,080
They'd have got to Jessica.
Tom would still be alive.

487
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,656
I made a really bad mistake, Bill.

488
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,320
I made a really, really bad mistake.

489
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,880
That's all right, son.

490
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,720
You didn't mean to, Ian.

491
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,840
I know you didn't mean to.

492
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,040
Okay.

493
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,520
All right, so I... I need you
to concentrate, okay?

494
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,936
I need you to concentrate
because I have to start trying

495
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,760
to clear up this mess, all right?

496
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,800
Does Daniel Sugarman know about me?

497
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,880
He asked if anyone else knew
and I told him no.

498
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
He knew I was lying.

499
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
It's okay. It's okay.

500
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,416
That's okay. You know what?
I know you had no choice.

501
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,880
I know you had no choice.

502
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,080
What did you tell him?

503
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,160
I told him I knew a copper who could
smooth things over for us if we needed.

504
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,800
As long as nobody gets hurt.

505
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,640
I told him, I said...
I said, "That is a deal-breaker."

506
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,760
No violence, no bloodshed.

507
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,440
Did you give him my name?

508
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,240
No, I wouldn't do that.

509
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,616
Is there anything he asked you to do,

510
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,440
anything that might help me
find him before my friends do?

511
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,320
I don't know.

512
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,600
He said something about passports

513
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,000
and I told him to get in touch
with Patrick Holguin.

514
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,400
That's good, Bill.
That's really, really good.

515
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,200
That might help us.

516
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,200
Will you be okay?

517
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,080
Oh, Bill, this is not about me.

518
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
I'm nothing.

519
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,240
Jessica Carrodus is dead,

520
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,760
and I'm gonna have to try
and live with that somehow.

521
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,600
But you've gotta understand
that this has grown.

522
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,680
And if I go to prison for this,

523
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,840
then every case that I've ever convicted
will be questioned.

524
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,280
And all the murderers,
the rapists, the predators,

525
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,320
they might get out.

526
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,360
They might be back on the street.

527
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,440
And whatever they do after that,
whoever they hurt...

528
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,480
..that'll be my fault.

529
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,680
And I can't live with that.
I can't. I just... I just can't.

530
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,960
I'm sorry, son.

531
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,600
Do you want a drink?

532
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah.

533
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,440
I'm so sorry, son.

534
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,160
Me, too.

535
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,880
Thanks for coming.

536
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,520
How could I not?

537
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,680
- You sounded...
- This is such an interesting place.

538
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,760
John Milton was buried here.

539
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,360
- You know Paradise Lost?
- Mmm.

540
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,280
Very well.

541
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,960
He wrote it to justify
the ways of God to men.

542
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
But even he couldn't do that.

543
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,120
God emerged as a tyrant.

544
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,480
Satan as a hero.

545
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,360
Where is this leading?

546
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,840
All those things you said to me

547
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,160
about Zoe,

548
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,520
about me, about us, about all of us.

549
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,240
You were right.

550
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,880
There is no love, not really, you know?

551
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,840
Most of its just cruel and deceitful,

552
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
just matter.

553
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,720
I saw a lot of matter today.

554
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,400
Matter all over the place.

555
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,520
There is nothing.

556
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,480
There's absolutely nothing.

557
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,240
You know you hurt me very badly.

558
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
Don't. Okay?

559
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
- No games.
- No games. Listen.

560
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,960
I did what I did to Henry Madsen
because I wanted to help you.

561
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,840
I put my liberty at risk
because I couldn't...

562
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,600
bear to see you hurt.

563
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,560
So what I did, I did for...

564
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,640
..wholly unselfish reasons.

565
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,600
- I don't...
- Yes, you do.

566
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,440
"The mind is its own place,

567
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,240
"and in itself
can make a heaven of hell,

568
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,760
"a hell of heaven."

569
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,480
The universe isn't evil, John.
It's just indifferent.

570
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,760
That hasn't changed. It can't.

571
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
But what I did for you
proved something to me.

572
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
Something I hadn't...

573
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,160
..believed...

574
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
- ..until that moment.
- What?

575
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,880
It's you who's right.

576
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,400
There is love in the world.

577
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,120
Thank you.

578
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
Thank you.

579
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,320
Any progress on Carrodus?

580
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,360
No activity on the credit cards
or the mobile.

581
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,200
Right now I need to see
Evangeline's stuff.

582
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
It's fake.

583
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,360
Em, how quickly can we
find out who made this?

584
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,760
Batches of forged passports tend to have
defects specific to the forger,

585
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,856
so Benny should be able
to identify it pretty quickly.

586
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,440
All right, cool.

587
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,176
- Do you want me to come with?
- No. Stay here.

588
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,600
Stay on Carrodus.

589
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,560
Oh, get the diamonds back
in the evidence room,

590
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,440
save the Duchess's sanity.

591
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,680
If I get a line on Sugarman,
I'll call you.

592
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,720
- Patrick, yeah?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,240
Can you make me a passport? A good one?

594
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,640
- Best you'll get.
- Yeah?

595
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
- There, you see that?
- Oh, no, not again.

596
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,536
All right, now I don't have much time,
so I'm not going to drag this out.

597
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,216
How many fingers
do I have to break before I...

598
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,240
He's staying
at The Renaissance. The big hotel.

599
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,720
How do you know that?

600
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,320
He wanted a total
of nine passports for three people.

601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,960
- So0?
- So nobody buys in that volume,

602
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,600
except terrorists and whatever.

603
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
They have a lot
of aircrews at The Renaissance

604
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,376
and I thought, I don't
want anything to do with any of that,

605
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,480
thank you very much.

606
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,240
- So then what?
- So I followed him.

607
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,176
What? You were going to make him pay for
the passports, then grass him up?

608
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,320
Too right. I've got to live
in this city, you know. I've got family.

609
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Not even forgers are honest these
days. Go on, get out of here.

610
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,200
Wait a second.

611
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,880
What did you mean, "not again"?

612
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,760
Hey, John. What's up?

613
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,880
Zan. Don't do it.

614
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,800
Don't do what?

615
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,360
I know what you're about to do.

616
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,440
And what am I about to do?

617
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,696
Look, I saw your face
at the crime scene, all right?

618
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,560
I know it did something to you.

619
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,960
I know how that feels.

620
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,400
But if you hurt Sugarman,
you'll go down for it.

621
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,120
All right? It'll finish you.

622
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Who says I'm going to hurt Sugarman?

623
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,480
I spoke to the passport forger.
I know you're looking for him.

624
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,400
So?

625
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,040
So, look, if you want two minutes with
him alone, break his legs, whatever,

626
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,160
but just let me be there
to tell you when to stop, mate.

627
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,600
All right. Okay, listen,
let's meet at The Fountain.

628
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,360
Fountain, yeah, all right.
Erm, I can be there at 3:00?

629
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,360
All right, but just you.

630
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Not Teller. Not Ripley.

631
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,960
- Just me and you, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just me and you.

632
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,800
No Ripley, no Teller.
All right, 3:00 at The Fountain.

633
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,840
Okay, bye.

634
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,920
You're not going to be
at The Fountain, are you, Ian?

635
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,040
Excuse me,
no time to bullshit. Is this man here?

636
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Erm...

637
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,600
Oh, you lying bastard, John.
You lying bastard.

638
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,280
Which room?

639
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,200
Listen!

640
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
Listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me!

641
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,160
Listen, someone's coming here
for you, okay?

642
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,200
He's coming. He'll be here very
soon if he isn't here already.

643
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,440
Now, ordinarily, I'd let him
do whatever he wants to you,

644
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,280
but he's my mate, okay, and I don't
want to see him go to prison,

645
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,440
so if you want to live,
Daniel, I need you to listen to me.

646
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,840
Come with me. Whoa! Ian, Ian, Ian.

647
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
Ian. Ian, listen!

648
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,160
If you kill this man,
that's it for you, you know that, right?

649
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,400
What are you going to do, John?
Arrest me?

650
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,640
No! That's not what I mean
and you know that.

651
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,760
No, I've known you too long, mate.

652
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,000
I know how your mind works.

653
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,200
Ian, this is not a play.

654
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,720
All right? This is not a tactic.

655
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,416
Do you have any idea of the lies
I've told for you over the years,

656
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,880
for all the shit you've done?

657
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,800
Yeah, well I've never
killed anyone, have I?

658
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah.

659
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,480
Not for lack of trying.

660
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And it was you, Ian,
that stopped me every single time.

661
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,280
So here I am, all right,
returning the favour.

662
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,760
Don't do it.

663
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,040
No matter how much
he's earned it. It's not worth it.

664
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,120
- Hold on...
- What did this turd say to you?

665
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,200
- What?
- What did he say about me?

666
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,160
- What do you mean?
- What did he say?

667
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,400
What?

668
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,920
Now it makes sense.

669
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,800
- You must be...
- Shut up.

670
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,640
Shit. Whatever.

671
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,000
Oh!

672
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,360
What did he say?

673
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,640
- I don't know what you mean.
- What did he say?

674
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,360
I don't know what you mean, Ian!

675
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,560
I don't know what you mean,
all right? Help me here, I'm lost.

676
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,120
I'm just lost.

677
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,680
Whatever this is... Whatever this is,

678
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,320
all right, we can make it go away.

679
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,960
I was here to make an arrest.

680
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,520
Sugarman was armed, all right?

681
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,960
You thought my life was in imminent
danger and you took appropriate action.

682
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,080
Don't say that.

683
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,760
- Why?
- Because you don't know what I've done.

684
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,616
I do know what you've done and I don't
care about it, mate. He is nothing!

685
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,520
- No, not him.
- He's nothing.

686
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,720
What?

687
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,040
Look, I knew
about the robbery, all right?

688
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,680
You... You what?

689
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,320
Yeah, I let it go ahead
for a percentage.

690
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,200
And that's why I'm here.

691
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,560
Not for revenge, but to shut him up.

692
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,360
Now, still want to help me?
Still want to make it go away?

693
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,240
Did you know about the kidnapping?

694
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,400
No.

695
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,920
All right, well, then, good,
‘cause I don't care.

696
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,240
We can still make this work.

697
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,600
I didn't want any of this, John.
You know that.

698
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,040
I tried to make it right.
I wanted it to be right.

699
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,760
I know. All right. I know.

700
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,136
How can I believe you?
You know how much I want to.

701
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,920
Because you know
when I'm lying.

702
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,840
And right now I'm not lying!

703
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,360
Take it.

704
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,480
All right?

705
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,216
- You lying, bastard. You set me up.
- Whoa, whoa!

706
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,800
No, I didn't, Ian!

707
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,400
Ian!

708
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,600
Did you see him? Did you see anyone?

709
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,040
No? Ian, look, it's just the maid!

710
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,480
Shit.

711
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Ugh.

712
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,120
There were no diamonds found,

713
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,680
and the concierge...

714
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,600
..says that, er,

715
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,520
- this is the gunman.
- Yeah.

716
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I don't know.

717
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,400
All right. That's enough.
Go and get yourself checked out.

718
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,000
Eat. Get some rest.

719
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,920
Ian. Ian, listen to me,
listen to me. We need, erm...

720
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,176
We've got to start talking, mate.
We've got to start talking,

721
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,800
otherwise this is going
to bring us both down, all right?

722
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,840
I need you to talk to me.

723
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,160
Put these away in the safe, would you?

724
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,760
Ah. Hello, sir.

725
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,480
You were going to value
some diamonds for me.

726
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,160
Yes, erm...

727
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,800
They're fakes, James.

728
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,200
They're good fakes, but they're fakes.

729
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,320
Evidence in a fraud trial.

730
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,680
Best we could do at short notice.

731
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,320
Jessica?

732
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,520
Thanks.

733
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,120
Hi, it's me. I'm not going to stay
at Heather and Allan's.

734
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,120
It's silly. I'm going to come home.

735
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,936
I'm going to get in the car
now and I'm going to come home.

736
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,320
I love you.

737
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,640
See you soon.

738
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,160
- Ian?
- Hi. Can I, erm...

739
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,000
- Yeah, of course, of course. Come in.
- Thanks.

740
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,440
Erm, tea?

741
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,320
Er, yeah, yeah. Tea sounds...
Tea sounds great.

742
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,600
Er, unless you've got anything stronger.

743
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,960
Oh, so what's wrong?

744
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,600
Oh.

745
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,920
Bad day.

746
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,240
For everyone, apparently.

747
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,520
Er, listen, Zoe, I need you to...

748
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,800
I need you to call John
for me and, er, ask him over.

749
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,360
- Why?
- Just do it, please. Would you?

750
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,640
But you can't tell him I'm here.

751
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,640
Why not?

752
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,840
- It's complicated.
- And it's my house.

753
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,200
So what's going on?

754
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,320
Okay. You, er...

755
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,176
You ever have
one of those days you wish it would end,

756
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,600
but somehow it never does?

757
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,240
More than my share.

758
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,560
Well, that day's today. Cheers.

759
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,560
And if you do this for me,

760
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,040
all right, you're going to
help end it, so please...

761
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,760
Please, will you just call John?

762
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,080
I can't.

763
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,280
Why not?

764
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,720
Because, actually, you're scaring me.

765
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,120
Look, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.

766
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,800
You know me and John are friends, right?

767
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,680
Well, so call him yourself.

768
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,720
I can't. I can't. I just can't.

769
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,280
It's just things have got
really complicated.

770
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,680
Look, Ian,

771
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,800
I can see things aren't right,
that you're in trouble.

772
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,960
All I can do is tell you to trust
him because he's your friend

773
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,256
and that means a great deal to him,

774
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,720
but I can't call him up and lie to him

775
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,480
and pretend you're not here.
I can't do that.

776
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,600
- You have to.
- No, I don't!

777
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,160
Just do it.

778
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,320
Just get your phone.

779
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,360
Zoe, please. Please get your phone.

780
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,280
I don't want to hurt you.
That's not what I'm here for.

781
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,760
I just need you to call John,
all right, and ask him over.

782
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,080
And when he comes, will you
be pointing that thing at him?

783
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,880
Yeah. I might have to. Just for a bit.

784
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,520
Just so I can sit him down
and make him hear what I've got to say.

785
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,160
All I want is to trust him.

786
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,520
And if I don't?

787
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,840
Don't make me answer that
question, please. Look at me.

788
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,280
Hear what I've got to say.

789
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,280
Don't make me answer that question.

790
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,320
- Ian, please don't.
- Just do it!

791
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
I can't find my phone.

792
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,560
Zoe.

793
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,600
John?

794
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,320
Yeah.

795
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,360
John, can you hear me?

796
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,120
Yeah, I can hear you. What's up?

797
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,280
- Ian Reed's here. He's got a gun!
- No, no, no!

798
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,960
- Don't do that. Put it down!
- Help, call the police!

799
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,160
Zoe!

800
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,440
- Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up.
- Just get out of my house!

801
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,600
Listen. Are you there? Zoe?

802
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,560
Zoe, can you hear me?

803
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,000
Shut up. Will you shut up?
Shut the fuck up!

804
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,000
Get out of my house!

805
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,440
Ian, listen to me, this isn't you.
I'm begging you, leave her alone.

806
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,800
- Come on, Zoe, come on.
- Please!

807
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,760
Zoe, Zoe, listen, listen.

808
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,600
Please!

809
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,840
No!

810
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,240
Zo? Babe?

811
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,840
Babe?

812
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,480
Babe, are you there?

813
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,200
No!

814
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,120
Ian? Ian?

815
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,760
Ian, what have you done?

816
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,120
Ian, Ian,
I will kill you, I will kill you.

817
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,760
If you've hurt Zoe, I will kill you.

818
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,640
I swear I will kill you
if you've hurt Zoe, Ian.

819
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,800
This is your fault, John.

820
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,400
Ian, Ian.

821
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,200
This is your doing.

822
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,016
Please be there, please be there.

823
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,240
Rose, Rose!

824
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,440
It's me, John. Listen,
I think Ian's hurt her!

825
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,520
As soon as you
get this message, send a medic!

826
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,120
Zoe!

827
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,240
Zoe!

828
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,440
Zoe!

829
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,400
20?

830
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,640
No, no, no, no, no.

831
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,400
Oh.

832
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,840
No, no, no, no.

833
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,160
Babe, babe.

834
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,800
Baby.

835
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,680
Ahhh!

836
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,560
What have you done?

837
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,560
No!

838
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,720
He killed his wife!

839
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,400
Wake up! Stop protecting him!

840
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,800
I am coming for you.

841
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,320
All I have to do is stay free
long enough to see you dead.

842
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,480
- Alice, I need you to help me.
- Where do we start?

843
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,800
- I can bring him in.
- He's gonna kill you.

844
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,560
It's not gonna come to that!

845
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,320
You won't hesitate
to give the kill order?

846
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,880
Absolutely not.

847
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,360
John, run! Run!

848
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:51,384
