1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,120
- Nothing?
- No, ma'am.

2
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,800
Her oxygen ran out two minutes ago.

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
John said she's here, so she's here.

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,120
Oh, Henry.

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,320
- You're gonna fall, Henry.
- Oh, God.

6
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,920
Please.

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,720
- Where's Mia?
- I don't know.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,120
Where is she?

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
Nothing.

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,376
Where is she?
Where is she?

11
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,440
Living room!

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
For God's sake, there's a
panel behind the plasterboard.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,920
Please!

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,240
John?

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,440
Living room, there's a panel in the
plasterboard.

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,640
Living room. Living room!

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
- Come on!
- Living room!

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
Help me with this.

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,680
Please, I'm gonna fall, I'm gonna fall.

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,896
What if you're lying to me?

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,720
What if you are lying, because
you've done that before, haven't you?

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,680
You've lied. And lied and lied!

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm not lying, I swear.
She's there. Ahhh.

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,720
- Please.
- Ahhh!

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,040
- John, she's here.
- Is she alive?

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,720
I can't tell yet.

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Come on. Oh, come on, please.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
Please!

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Please!

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Good girl. Good girl.

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
- We've got her.
- Oh, thank God.

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
Get me up, please!

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,200
- Thank God.
- Please, please.

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,600
Please!

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,520
Well done, you're all right now.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,800
- Henry, tell me about the others.
- Please!

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,920
- How many more were there?
- None.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Henry, can you tell me
how many more were there?

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,720
How many were there?

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,480
Because there was Adrian,
and there was little Gabriella,

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,040
and of course there was Emma!

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,280
Emma. I dug Emma out with my own hands!

43
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,640
But it was too late.

44
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Please, please.

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Please.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,720
Please, please.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,440
Please! Please!

48
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,840
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

49
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,920
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,840
♪ Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
♪ She will love you like a fly

52
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,320
♪ Will never love you again ♪

53
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,680
This may turn out to be
the first time I actually beat you.

54
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Got to go.

55
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Emergency, which service?

56
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,400
Police, please. Please.

57
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,936
Go ahead, caller.
You're through to the police.

58
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,160
It's my mum.

59
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,960
Hurry, it's my mum.

60
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,960
- What's happened to your mum?
- Oh, God.

61
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
Oh, God.

62
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh! I think my mum and dad are dead.

63
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,320
Mum.

64
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, God. Oh, God.

65
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,840
Please, please. Please.

66
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,440
Listen to me now.
Stay on the line but make yourself safe.

67
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,720
Boss.

68
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,560
So, Reed was right.

69
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,160
This is where you spend
your gardening leave, is it?

70
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Staring down a big hole.

71
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,600
We have the Madsen verdict.

72
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Given the exceptional circumstances,

73
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
the inquiry have found
no grounds for disciplinary action.

74
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,760
Which means you're back.

75
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
If you want it.

76
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
I want it.

77
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,240
Rule number one, don't get
yourself into this situation again.

78
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,440
Which means you observe
case management protocol.

79
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,000
Any pro-active strategies are
to be signed off by me.

80
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,840
I don't sign, they don't happen.

81
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
- Is that the speech?
- That's the speech.

82
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,720
- It's a good speech.
- Thank you. It's one I prepared earlier.

83
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,240
- You and Zoe, you spoken?
- No. Not for a while.

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,520
- And?
- It was a trial separation. I tried it,

85
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,120
- didn't like it.
- She feel the same?

86
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,880
Rose, I did everything she asked for.

87
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
Got myself together.

88
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
So now we'll see.

89
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,680
Well, that's the difference
between her and me.

90
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,960
She talks about taking
you back, I actually do it.

91
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
DCI John Luther, DS Justin Ripley.

92
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,160
- Good morning, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,800
So... Welcome back and whatever.

94
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,160
- Yes, shall we?
- All right.

95
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,880
So, do we need to have the chat?

96
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,440
What chat?

97
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,680
I was sick, I got better, I'm back, etc.

98
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,560
Um, then, no. We don't need the chat.

99
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,800
Good.

100
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,840
I've lobbied to be stationed with you.

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,760
I put in the request nine months ago.

102
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Chased it up
three times a week in writing.

103
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
- So, what we got?
- Um, home invasion.

104
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,200
Murder. Victims are
Douglas and Laura Morgan.

105
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Who called it in?

106
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
The daughter, Alice Morgan.
She was out when it happened.

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Doing?

108
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
Buying bread and milk.

109
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
She live there?

110
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,280
Uh, no, she's a research fellow
for some department of Physics.

111
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,200
- She lives in a flat near campus.
- Why the family gathering?

112
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,360
- Douglas Morgan's birthday.
- Right, let's go.

113
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,120
Sir.

114
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,400
First responders have
this down as point of entry.

115
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,840
The daughter left it unlocked
when she went out.

116
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,080
So we need to look for any indication
that the shooter was watching the house.

117
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,960
Possible vantage points,
any hiding places.

118
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,200
Good line of sight.

119
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
You might want to keep
your hands in your pockets.

120
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,600
Reduces temptation to touch anything.

121
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,880
Sleeping pills.

122
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,320
Separate bedrooms.
What does that tell you?

123
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,000
Husband snored?

124
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,080
Anything else?

125
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,320
It's hard to say. Sometimes separate
beds make for a happy marriage.

126
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,880
That's a very generous thought.

127
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,520
It's good.

128
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,680
He didn't hear it coming.

129
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,760
He's a published poet. Small press.

130
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,520
So, no sign of burglary. No attempt to
stage the scene and no sexual assault.

131
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,000
- Contract killer, maybe?
- Well, it's workable.

132
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,040
I mean, the shooter
has done his homework.

133
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,640
He knows the layout of the place.

134
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,000
He eliminates
any physical threat, the dog.

135
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
Douglas, what kind of weapon was it?

136
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Some kind of low-calibre handgun.

137
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
- Some kind? No gun?
- They are still searching.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,960
House, grounds, drains. Nothing so far.

139
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Yes, see, someone that efficient,

140
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,000
you would expect him
to ditch the gun at the scene.

141
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,360
Am I missing something?
Does that seem right to you?

142
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,160
- None of it seems right to me.
- Because it's not right, is it?

143
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
It's not right.

144
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,216
I'll, uh, meet you upstairs, yeah?

145
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah, sure.

146
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,000
Zoe Luther.

147
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,920
- Hey, babe. It's me.
- John, hi.

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,040
- Guess what?
- What?

149
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,360
Sir.

150
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,040
The Board of Inquiry's
came down on my side.

151
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,680
Oh, John! Oh, really good news,
that's great.

152
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,920
I mean, I knew they would,
obviously, but...

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,440
- Yeah, and I'm back at work.
- Already?

154
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,200
Well, they missed me.

155
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
What's wrong, babe?

156
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,800
Nothing's wrong, I'm just
on my way to a meeting, that's all.

157
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,200
Look, can we talk a bit later?

158
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,376
That's why I was calling, really.

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,120
So, you know,
‘cause I think that we, uh...

160
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,920
Well, we need to have that talk.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,880
Ah. Tonight I... I've got a dinner.

162
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,880
After dinner. Um, I'll come round.

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,520
Okay, tonight.

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,560
Look, I'm sorry,
I really do have to go.

165
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,920
Um...

166
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,240
- So...
- What?

167
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,000
I've got myself together. All right?

168
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm back, and I feel great, I'm good.

169
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,040
You know.

170
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,560
I know.

171
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,480
I know.

172
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Welcome back.

173
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,840
For you.

174
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,400
Thank you.

175
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
What does it say?

176
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,640
"You don't have to be mad
to work here, but it helps.”

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
Good to see ya.

178
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,040
Well, uh, thank you.

179
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,880
So they welcomed you back
with a weird one?

180
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,520
Yeah, they did welcome me back
with a weird one.

181
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,400
- You?
- Honour killing.

182
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,040
- Ouch.
- Hmm.

183
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,560
So, how are you?

184
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,920
Splendid.

185
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,720
Excellent, then. Good.

186
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,840
- Miss Luther, I'm Mark North.
- I remember, yes.

187
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,200
Did you tell him?

188
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,920
Zoe, he needs to know.

189
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
All this sneaking around, it's mad.

190
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,040
You've been separated for months.

191
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,656
He's the only one
that doesn't seem to know.

192
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,960
I know, I know, I know.

193
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,480
I wasn't going to tell
him when he was...

194
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,440
You know, getting better.

195
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
Now I wake up, I feel sick.

196
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,760
I've got this permanent knot
in my stomach.

197
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
It's gonna kill him.

198
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,320
You can't keep lying. It's cruel.

199
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,720
- Miss Morgan?
- Alice, please.

200
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,440
Alice. Hello, I'm John Luther.

201
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,120
Senior investigating officer. Can I?

202
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,640
You must be very tired.

203
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,640
Yes. I am.

204
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,520
I don't think I've ever been this tired.

205
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,840
It's shock.

206
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,760
It's the way our body reacts,
it's one of those strange things.

207
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Alice, I know this has been a terrible,
terrible day for you.

208
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,120
Things look bleak,
and you must be feeling very alone.

209
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
But believe me when I say

210
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,960
we will do everything we can
to find out who did this.

211
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,840
Thank you.

212
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,280
So, these things I'm going to ask you,
I have to ask.

213
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm sorry. Let me turn this on.

214
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
Do you have any idea who would
wish harm on your parents?

215
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,720
Hmm?

216
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,240
Even if it's just a feeling,

217
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,840
a sense of unease about someone.

218
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Something you heard your mum or dad say.

219
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,680
Something that didn't sit right.

220
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
No.

221
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,920
There's nothing, my mum
was a very kind, very...

222
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,320
Very gracious woman and...

223
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,496
- Can I get you a glass of water?
- No, I'm sorry.

224
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,136
- A cup of tea?
- I'll be okay, I'm just...

225
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
It's okay, it's okay.

226
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,960
And your dad?

227
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,720
He was a very admirable man, he was...

228
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,120
The thing is, Alice,

229
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,800
this was a very singular crime.

230
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,720
No sign of robbery.

231
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,720
And no apparent, and I'm sorry,

232
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,040
sexual motivation.

233
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,640
Now, I've been a police officer
for a very long time,

234
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,320
and one of the things that I've found is
that crimes like this aren't random.

235
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,040
And never without motive.
So, as painful as this is,

236
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm gonna ask you to dig deep
and really think

237
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,880
about any money issues
your parents may have been experiencing,

238
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,680
any marital difficulties.

239
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,720
I've done nothing but think,
all I do is think. There's nothing.

240
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,360
There's absolutely nothing.

241
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,000
- Guv.
- So, he's back?

242
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,000
From outer space.

243
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,720
You do know the man is nitro-glycerine?

244
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,200
With respect, sir, a comprehensive
investigation under your edict

245
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,600
cleared him of any wrongdoing.

246
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Not least because the only other witness
is in a coma,

247
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
measuring three on the Glasgow scale.

248
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
And Mia Dalton's in school today,
and not in the ground.

249
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,360
Rose, if you bet too heavily on Luther,
then you stand or fall with him.

250
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,000
And with you goes this unit,
and my credibility as its architect.

251
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,200
Haven't you worked too hard for too long

252
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,880
to take that big a risk
on such a wild card?

253
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,000
- I don't consider him a risk.
- Then what is he?

254
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
An investment.

255
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,920
And if Henry Madsen wakes up,

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
gives his account
of what happened that night?

257
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
Will Luther drag us all down?

258
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,360
Let's hope not.

259
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,920
So just one more time
so I'm absolutely clear.

260
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,040
You saw nothing or anyone unusual?

261
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,560
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,720
I wish I could tell you I had.

263
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,680
I've got this feeling,

264
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,480
this strange feeling like I'm looking at
it down the wrong end of a telescope.

265
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,400
Like it happened years ago.

266
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,760
That can happen with stress.

267
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,320
Different parts of the brain take over.

268
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,240
We remember things in different ways.

269
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm so sorry.
It's been a long day.

270
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,520
Really, it's fine.

271
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,960
It's very tiring going
round and round like this.

272
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
You must be exhausted.

273
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
Can I get you a coffee?

274
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,440
Tea would be nice.

275
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,680
She did it.

276
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
She did it. Look at this.

277
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,520
Hmm? Watch.

278
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,720
I'm so sorry. It's been a long day.

279
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,920
There, she didn't yawn.

280
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,800
She didn't yawn. Yawning is contagious.

281
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,040
Someone in a room yawns, you yawn, too.
See, even talking about it.

282
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,480
It's to do with parts of the brain
that deal with empathy.

283
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,280
She didn't yawn. She did it.

284
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
And he's back.

285
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
Nothing in her affect points
to survivor guilt.

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
"Why them? Why not me?"
That's pretty atypical.

287
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,040
So her affect's off.
It could be medication, shock. Whatever.

288
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,160
Could be. Except it's not.

289
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,696
This kind of scenario, an offender
typically tries to stage the scene,

290
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,640
make it look like murder, suicide,
a burglary gone wrong.

291
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
- But...
- She did none of that.

292
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
- Exactly.
- Exactly how?

293
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,520
'Cause she's proud of this!
I mean, why give anyone else the credit?

294
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,640
- To alibi herself?
- She doesn't care about alibis.

295
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,120
She's a malignant narcissist.

296
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,600
This is about prestige, power,
self-affirmation.

297
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,280
The timeline doesn't work.

298
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,640
Three minutes before
she called 999 she was at the shops.

299
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,440
- There's not enough time.
- There's not enough anything.

300
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,320
Absence is the point.

301
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
It's a way of her saying
to us, "Look at me!"

302
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,640
So where's the gun?
It's got to be somewhere.

303
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
- Everything's somewhere.
- I don't know.

304
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,080
Say that again. That was special.

305
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
I don't know where the gun is.

306
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,696
No, she doesn't look the type.

307
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,816
Yeah, well,
that's the thing about people,

308
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,680
they always find ways to surprise you.

309
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,120
Tea.

310
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,680
Is your chair okay?

311
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,160
Comfy?

312
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
It's fine, thank you.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,280
Only sometimes,
we like to shorten one of the legs

314
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,120
so the suspect
can never get comfortable.

315
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,960
Never relax, always unbalanced.

316
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,040
Is it too hot?

317
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,640
Really. It's fine.

318
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,640
I see you got
your PhD at 18 years old.

319
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,760
Astrophysics, was it?

320
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,880
Dark Matter
Distribution in Disc Galaxies.

321
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,960
Dark Matter. That's the stuff that
makes up the universe.

322
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,440
But it doesn't interact
with the things we know

323
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,920
and in the way we expect.

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
No, but its presence
can be inferred from

325
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,160
gravitational effects on visible matter.

326
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,720
We know it's there.

327
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,960
We just can't see it.

328
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,080
Would many police officers be able

329
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,896
to gain my trust
by having this conversation?

330
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,800
I don't know, I just like to read books.

331
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,480
It beats burning them.

332
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,040
No but you're the one
that's practically a genius.

333
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
- Only practically?
- So you went to Oxford at what?

334
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,360
- Thirteen.
- Wow, that's young.

335
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,560
These child prodigies,
they're not one thing or the other,

336
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
they're sort of freaks, really.

337
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,040
But I expect your parents were proud.

338
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Very.

339
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,840
There were newspaper articles.

340
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,920
Pictures of mum, dad and me,
smiling in the library.

341
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,720
When I was nine,
I proved tangent minus 1x.

342
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,200
They bought me a dress.

343
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Got me on the news.

344
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
I wonder what that was like?

345
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,760
You know 13 years old,
classmates were what? 20, 22?

346
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,920
No friends your age.

347
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,080
- No boyfriends.
- Quite a presumption.

348
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,640
Actually, I matured very early sexually.

349
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,520
Alice, are you familiar
with Ockham's razor?

350
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,120
"All things being equal, the simplest
solution is the best solution.”

351
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,720
That's right.

352
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,320
And what that principle tells me
is that the only other person

353
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
known to have been
at your parents' house this morning...

354
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,960
It was you.

355
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,760
I... I don't see how it's possible
to arrive at that conclusion.

356
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,600
Well, there was no evidence
of an intruder.

357
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,320
But absence of evidence
isn't evidence of absence.

358
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,960
I know. I'm making a leap.
It's a little leap, though.

359
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
It's more of a hop.

360
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,560
Is this where you ask me
if I hated my parents?

361
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,400
- It is about that time, yeah.
- Did they make me a freak? Yes.

362
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,600
Did I hate them?
Absolutely. Did I kill them?

363
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,280
- No.
- Can you prove that?

364
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,840
I can't prove a negative.

365
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
It can't be done.

366
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,160
Innocence is a negative.
It's the absence of guilt.

367
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,920
Meaning the burden of proof
is entirely yours.

368
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,760
If you think I did this, then you need
to demonstrate how and when.

369
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,920
I know, and I won't
be able to do that, will I?

370
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
- Well, you can certainly try.
- Because there is nothing.

371
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
You don't interact with the things
we know in the way that we expect.

372
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,600
Your presence, your actions,
can only be inferred by a certain...

373
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,080
- absence.
- Is that a compliment?

374
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,160
- Absolutely.
- Ah, are you trying to beguile me?

375
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,640
No, I wouldn't be so foolish.

376
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,120
But I will tell you this,
Alice, you can revel in your brilliance

377
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,080
for as long as you like.
But people slip up.

378
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,480
Happens time and time again.

379
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,920
Well, that's just faulty logic
postulated on imperfect data collection.

380
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,400
What if you only catch people
who make mistakes?

381
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,800
That would skew the figures,
wouldn't it?

382
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
- Yes, it would.
- Hmm.

383
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,200
But criminals aren't as smart
as they think they are.

384
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,840
Oh, that must get monotonous.
For someone as brilliant as you.

385
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
Ian, am I wrong?

386
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,160
- You're not wrong.
- No.

387
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,560
Guyv.

388
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,040
There's got to be something
we can find to charge her with.

389
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,240
Such as? Being a space oddity?

390
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,120
Such as, she killed them.

391
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
Look, right now she's little girl lost.
We've got no real motive.

392
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,880
- She hated her parents.
- Seriously, who doesn't?

393
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
There's no forensics, no witnesses.

394
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Timeline alone gets it
laughed out the CPS.

395
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,880
You saw her in there.
It excites her that we know she did it.

396
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,360
So prove it. Bring me
something of substance.

397
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,040
Find me the gun, put it in her hand.

398
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,000
Until then, cut her loose
and send her home.

399
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,760
Thank you very much,
Miss Morgan, you're free to go.

400
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Well, I enjoyed our chat.

401
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
You're very interesting.

402
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:30,384
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

403
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,520
Wow! Nice dress.

404
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,520
Just come from dinner?

405
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
Come in.

406
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
Hi.

407
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,520
What's wrong?

408
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,080
You look tired.

409
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,080
Me? Oh, no, I'm all right.
Why, what's wrong?

410
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
John, I know... I know
what you came here to discuss.

411
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,920
But before you say anything,
you need to know that I've met somebody.

412
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,520
- Sorry?
- I met someone.

413
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,120
What do you mean? You met...
Someone, who?

414
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,400
Someone.

415
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,560
What do you mean, um, Zoe?

416
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,720
When?

417
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,480
A while ago.

418
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,720
- Who?
- It doesn't matter.

419
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,200
It does matter.

420
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,960
Are you sleeping with him?

421
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,760
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

422
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,280
Zoe, no! Zoe, no!

423
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,320
Why would you do that?

424
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,160
Why, Zoe? Come on. Why?

425
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,360
Hmm?

426
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
Go home, John.

427
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,320
This is my home.

428
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,200
No.

429
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,320
Zoe called.

430
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
There we are. All right?

431
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,920
Are you gonna say anything?

432
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,040
Anything you'd like me to say?

433
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
No.

434
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
Well, then why say it?

435
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
Where you going?

436
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,120
Do you ever get
a song stuck in your head?

437
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,920
And it just keeps going
round and round and round?

438
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,400
T'Pau. China in Your Hand.
Cool, deep strangeness, that song.

439
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,800
- High weirdness.
- I've been thinking.

440
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
She's a narcissist, isn't she?

441
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,640
She needs constant recognition.

442
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,520
Needs to exaggerate her accomplishments.

443
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,000
How does someone like that keep secret
the most perfect thing she ever did?

444
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,920
You don't need to be thinking
about Alice Morgan right now.

445
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,480
Why? What do you suggest
I think about, hmm?

446
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,080
My wife? Henry Madsen?

447
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,560
I don't know. Normal stuff. Breakfast.

448
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,000
The way Alice Morgan sees it,

449
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,440
is this world is full of people
that have offended her,

450
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,840
embarrassed her, let her down,
and those people deserve to be punished.

451
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,720
She's already gotten away with it once
and she's eyeing her next victim.

452
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
And she won't stop until
someone stops her.

453
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
Until I stop her.

454
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,440
- All right, so be patient. Build a case.
- There is no case!

455
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,040
She didn't leave one.
She didn't leave anything.

456
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,200
Well, so what you thinking?

457
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,240
Well, she's compelled
to impress, isn't she?

458
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,640
People in general,
but right now me in particular.

459
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,920
She needs to show me
how brilliant she is.

460
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,240
She needs to be admired.

461
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
- John...
- And I give that to her.

462
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,920
I take it away, I make her angry.
And then I watch her get careless.

463
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,320
- Slow down.
- I'll call you later.

464
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,000
- They burned my dog.
- It's protocol. It's what happens.

465
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,080
He was only a dog.

466
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,320
It seems unduly pitiless to me,
to burn someone's dog.

467
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,280
It seems kind of pitiless
to shoot the dog in the first place.

468
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,600
Oh! You look exhausted.

469
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,280
Would you like to come in?

470
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,520
Are we being listened to?

471
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,200
- Would it make a difference?
- Who knows?

472
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,880
No, we're not.

473
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,840
So, you're not here to interrogate me.

474
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
No.

475
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,000
Liar.

476
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
This is a black hole.

477
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It consumes matter, sucks it in
and crushes it beyond existence.

478
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,440
When I first heard that,
I thought, that's evil at its most pure.

479
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,800
Something that drags you in,
crushes you, makes you...

480
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,320
- Nothing.
- I love to talk about nothing.

481
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,160
It's the only thing
I know anything about.

482
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,320
Don't you believe in evil?

483
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,880
- I have to. I've seen it.
- Ah.

484
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,240
- Henry Madsen.
- Henry and others like him.

485
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,880
Me?

486
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,920
Conceivably.

487
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,640
- What's happening to your marriage?
- Huh?

488
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,120
Last time I saw you, there was a ring.
Today, no ring.

489
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,440
Is someone else involved?

490
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm not here to discuss that, Alice.

491
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,840
Is he handsome?

492
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,040
If you like that sort of thing, I guess.

493
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Are you in pain?

494
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,840
You don't understand love, Alice.

495
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,600
It's not your fault. You can mimic it

496
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,576
and I guess you can
recognise it in other people,

497
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,120
but you will never be able
to understand love.

498
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Did you come here for sex?

499
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,120
No.

500
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,480
Because you'd be surprised
how many men do.

501
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,720
Do you think they have any idea
how fatuous they look?

502
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,216
Well, some of us
are afraid of that, yeah.

503
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,200
- Then why?
- Why did I come here?

504
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,120
‘Cause I wanted to tell you
that I know you kept the gun

505
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,120
and sooner or later I'll find it.

506
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,360
Well, why would I do that?

507
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,176
Ah, you just couldn't help yourself,
could you?

508
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,240
Wouldn't it make things easy
for you if that were true? But it's not.

509
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,360
There's no gun to find.

510
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,960
See, keeping that gun
wasn't a rational decision.

511
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,920
It was a compulsion.
You did it "cause you needed to do it.

512
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,120
And it's that compulsion
that makes you weak

513
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,080
in ways that you
can't see or understand.

514
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,800
And it's that compulsion
that's gonna get you caught.

515
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,776
And it will bring you down, Alice,
it always does.

516
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Just like clockwork.

517
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,600
Are you threatening me?
Because honestly, I wouldn't.

518
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,800
- And why's that?
- Come now, really.

519
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,200
Because I'd be hurt and angry.

520
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,840
I wonder.

521
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,080
Why did your wife turn her
face from you, John?

522
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
Why would she do that?

523
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,440
Is it because you shine so bright?

524
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,640
- I'm coming for you.
- Not if I come for you first.

525
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,440
Good morning.

526
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,240
- Out, you two. Go on.
- John!

527
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,160
- Raus! Raus! Come on.
- John!

528
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,256
If you're thinking of calling security,
don't bother.

529
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,520
Call the police. Let's go.
Arriba! Arriba! Andale! Andale!

530
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,520
This is his sense of humour.
Everyone, this is my husband, John.

531
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,680
That's right, I am her husband.

532
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,720
Way to get me sacked.

533
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,120
John, the people in this office,
they don't know you.

534
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,920
They're scared.
They think you're gonna do something.

535
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,000
Do I embarrass you?

536
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,520
Right now? Right at this moment?
Absolutely.

537
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
- Yes!
- Is that what this is all about?

538
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,680
- No!
- Am I boring?

539
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,640
Hmm? Boring? "Cause, personally
I don't think that I am boring.

540
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,840
You're not boring.
You're the opposite of boring.

541
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,120
And him?

542
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,680
His name's Mark.

543
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,640
Does a woman
just get to a stage in her life

544
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,896
when she says, "You know what?
I'd like my man to be boring"?

545
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,936
Because I have to tell you,
no one warned me about this.

546
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,360
He's not boring.

547
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,120
Is the sex good?

548
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,800
- It's not about the sex.
- It's always about the sex.

549
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,200
You enjoy sex with him. You must.

550
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,120
And that image just goes round and round
in my head like a train.

551
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,080
The trouble with you,
that train in your head never stops!

552
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,320
- You really frightened me last night.
- Come on, Zoe,

553
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
you know I'd never, ever hurt you.

554
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,120
- John. Why are you here?
- Well, I couldn't help but wonder

555
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,120
if perhaps you'd like to
come home and be married to me?

556
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,800
- Some men bring flowers...
- What, this was a grand gesture.

557
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,440
This is professional ruination,
is what this is.

558
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,120
Next time, think flowers.

559
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,080
Next time?

560
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,480
You know what I mean.

561
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,920
- I just need to know why.
- You always do.

562
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,320
But not everything has a motive.
Sometimes things just happen...

563
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,320
That's not true, everything has
a reason. There are physical laws,

564
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,120
I mean how did we...

565
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
How did we get here?

566
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,376
One minute I'm one place
and then next minute

567
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,440
I'm 15,000 miles away and
I know that I've travelled,

568
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
because I'm dizzy and
I just want to throw up.

569
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,240
I just can't remember
the bits in between.

570
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,000
You tell me.

571
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,280
How do you think we got here?

572
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,480
What happened?

573
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,520
Okay.

574
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,280
You're the reason.

575
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,920
- You are. You left.
- But I'm here.

576
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,800
Now. Look at me. I'm here.

577
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,720
Only part of you. But never all.

578
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,000
Because you care more about
the dead than the living.

579
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,320
- That's where your heart is.
- That is not true.

580
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,800
All those years spent up to your neck
in malignancy.

581
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,920
All those months
looking for Henry Madsen.

582
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,120
All the months that came after.
And you were just gone.

583
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,840
And you weren't coming back.
Not, not my you. Not my John!

584
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,120
Then him?

585
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,640
When he's with me, he's with me.

586
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,640
Is that all it takes, Zoe? Eh?

587
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
Do you love him?

588
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,680
Yes.

589
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
I'm sorry.

590
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,320
Um...

591
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,600
And me?

592
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,120
Always.

593
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,120
But not like that. Not any more.

594
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,880
Look, I know it's a cruel thing to hear,
but you need to accept it, John.

595
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,920
If you love me, you need to accept it.

596
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,880
I don't know how to do that.

597
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,920
Could you open
the door please, sir?

598
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,120
Could you open the door, please?

599
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,520
I'm a policeman.

600
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,480
I'm a policeman.

601
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,040
- How did you know I was here?
- Your phone was off.

602
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,280
- DI Reed said, "Try the wife."
- Oh, yeah?

603
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,760
Any news on the gun
that killed the Morgans?

604
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,496
No, we're still looking. But ballistics
came back on the bullets fired.

605
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,960
They were .9mm Parabellum.
Designed for ultra-compact weapons.

606
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
Good work.

607
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,000
Sod it.

608
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,000
"Raus, raus." ” Mother of God.

609
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,960
- Don't look at me.
- Okay! Okay!

610
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,840
- Shh. Shh.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

611
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,600
- Your husband assaulted me.
- What?

612
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,920
He touched me. Intimately.

613
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,080
He made me do things.
He hurt me, because of you.

614
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,240
What do you mean?

615
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,976
Well, as he touched me,
he talked about you.

616
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,600
He said you were dead, that
you'd been very badly burnt.

617
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,640
Your face was gone
and your skin was gone.

618
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,520
You'd been abducted off the street
by a man, a very sick man.

619
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,280
He kept you alive for days.

620
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,160
He used knives.

621
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,960
A blow torch. He kept pieces
of you for souvenirs.

622
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm worried that someone might
want to hurt you like that.

623
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,960
- Please, please don't.
- Shh. Shh.

624
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,600
Don't turn around.

625
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,960
DCI John Luther.

626
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,800
Zoe? Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

627
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,120
Bloody hell!

628
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,976
I mean, honestly, guy,
you should have just let me hold her.

629
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,080
You didn't give me enough to hold her.

630
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,480
And you can't prove
it was her this afternoon.

631
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,600
Zoe didn't see her face.
No CCTV, no eye witnesses, no nothing.

632
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,400
You do know this makes me
Alice Morgan's next project?

633
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,080
I questioned her brilliance,
offended her.

634
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,720
Do you know what she could do?
To me? To Zoe?

635
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,520
I know what you say she can do.

636
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,200
I also know we can't prove
what she already did.

637
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,200
And you can't detain people on suspicion
of crimes yet to be committed.

638
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,080
Be nice if we could.

639
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,120
So, what do I do to stop her?

640
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,280
Bring her in the right way.

641
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,160
- Ah, mate, mate, mate, thank you.
- Yeah, well.

642
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,920
- It's only a gun.
- So, tell me what I need to know.

643
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,920
All right, so what you've got, this is
a Glock 26, lightweight compact pistol.

644
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,440
Weighs less than 16 ounces.
Carbon steel spring and barrel,

645
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,720
polymer frame and components.

646
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,520
Polymer frame. Let me see it.

647
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,640
- Polymer. Plastic.
- Yeah, it's light.

648
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,480
- It's easy to carry.
- Plastic melts.

649
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,560
Plastic melts. Why am I thinking that?

650
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,480
Of course.

651
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,880
- "Knock knock?"
- What?

652
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,000
- Never mind. What's this?
- So.

653
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,440
Her parents get one shot to
the head each. Boom. Boom.

654
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,320
And the dog gets four.
Four shots spent killing the dog. Why?

655
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,560
It's a dog. It bites intruders.

656
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,040
- Why the overkill?
- Perversity. I don't know.

657
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,920
No, no. Four bullets in
the dog to maximise the mess.

658
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,560
To make the cause of death unambiguous.

659
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,400
She needed to blow the dog's head apart
to access the digestive tract.

660
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,040
She disassembles the gun, shoves
the pieces, the gloves, shell casings,

661
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,240
down the dog's gullet, into its stomach.

662
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,880
And then they cremate the dog.

663
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,600
- All right!
- It'll burn, watch.

664
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,360
- I have absolutely no doubt.
- Look at that, it's melting.

665
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,880
John, fine.

666
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,320
It's not enough.

667
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,040
The gun was in the dog.

668
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,440
Section 8, Police
and Criminal Evidence Act.

669
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,280
"A magistrate may issue a warrant
authorising the search of a premises

670
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,080
"provided there are reasonable grounds

671
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,896
"for believing
the location contains material

672
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,720
"with substantial evidentiary value.”

673
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,280
It's my assessment that saying,
"the gun was in the dog"

674
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,280
will not be judged by the issuing
magistrate to have met those criteria.

675
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,320
It's in there. On the mantelpiece.

676
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,840
And even if that were true, we can't
prove that Alice Morgan touched it,

677
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,200
let alone fired it. We need more.

678
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,480
We've got to trace the gun,
put it in her hands.

679
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,080
It won't be traceable.

680
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,720
She doesn't leave evidence,
just an evidence-shaped absence.

681
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,800
And after everything else,
that just infuriates you, doesn't it?

682
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,120
Come on!

683
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,560
She kills her parents and walks.

684
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,160
She threatens Zoe's life,
we can't touch her.

685
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,200
- This is Zoe we're talking about...
- John.

686
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,800
Who sat with your kids
the day your father died.

687
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,040
So take the chilly bitch down.

688
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,240
But slow down, calm down,
find another angle.

689
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,240
There are no other angles.
She left us nothing.

690
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,560
What do you need to prove more,

691
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,600
that Alice Morgan's guilty
or that you're right?

692
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
John!

693
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,160
Give me your wife's address.

694
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,560
What? Why?

695
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,560
I'll stay on her. Make sure she's okay.

696
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,760
You take down Alice Morgan.

697
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,520
I told you, boss.
The gun was in the dog.

698
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,400
‘Cause she needs it.

699
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,560
Alice.

700
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,800
That would be mine.

701
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,920
Hello, Alice.

702
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,576
Do you know why
the gun fragments in that urn

703
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,160
can never be
used as evidence against me?

704
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,880
One, the cremation melted
away their forensic value.

705
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,760
Because those ovens burn very,
very hot.

706
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,640
Two, you could never prove that
I ever knew the gun was in there,

707
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,440
let alone that I so much
as touched it. And three,

708
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,280
most dazzlingly, you broke in
to my apartment and stole it.

709
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,400
In the process you committed
a crime that will cost your job.

710
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,920
-So, congratulations.
Well done. -I know that.

711
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,120
This urn. This isn't evidence.

712
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,600
This is what you need to remind
yourself of who you really are.

713
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,400
That's why you followed me.
I know you. I see you.

714
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,800
And you think that I'm that weak?

715
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,920
- Yes.
- Then you don't know me at all.

716
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,520
Okay.

717
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,400
No, John! No!

718
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,920
- Stay away from Zoe!
- Is this what you did to Henry Madsen?

719
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,480
So, go on. Kiss me.

720
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,360
Kill me.

721
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,480
Do something.

722
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,680
Here's what's gonna happen.

723
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,440
You're gonna stay away from my wife,

724
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,600
or I'm gonna arrest someone else
for the murder of your parents.

725
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,360
Oh, yeah, by the time he's found guilty,
you'll have been forgotten about.

726
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,280
There will be no enigma
with Alice Morgan at the heart of it.

727
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,240
No one will wonder how you did it,
no one will think how clever you were.

728
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,520
I'll just plant the evidence.
I don't need the gun.

729
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,520
You'd degrade the law you serve,
just to protect some woman

730
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,320
who cast you aside like offal?

731
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,120
In a second.

732
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,960
And you think I'm the monster?

733
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,360
Love is supposed to
dignify us. Exalt us.

734
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,560
How can it be love, John, if all it does
is make you lonely and corrupt?

735
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,920
Answer the question.

736
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,480
Don't turn your back on me!

737
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,160
All right, Justin.
You can go home now, all right?

738
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,760
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

739
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,400
- I'm good. All right.
- Okay.

740
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,960
Sure, yeah?

741
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Very sure.

742
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,720
Go on.

743
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
20?

744
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,440
He'll leave. Let him go.

745
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,720
- Zoe!
- No. Sod him. He doesn't get to do this.

746
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,800
Zoe?

747
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,880
I hate to do this, it's my ex-husband.

748
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,560
He's, he's, um, I don't know...

749
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,840
Zo.

750
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Zoe.

751
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,880
- It's Mark, innit?
- That's right, yeah.

752
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,360
John, you need to go.
We called the police.

753
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,040
Come on, this is mad. What do you want?

754
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,296
I want to speak to Zoe, that's what.

755
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,296
Well, it's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen. Not today.

756
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,056
It's not gonna happen.
You need to go, come on.

757
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,696
Um, I know, I understand all of that
but I really do need to speak to her.

758
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,240
Okay? So can you just...

759
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,360
Just give her some time,
she needs some time.

760
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,296
- Maybe give her a call...
- One minute. That's all I need. Zoe!

761
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,256
I know I don't have the right,
but I want to speak to you,

762
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,640
just one minute is all I need.

763
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,320
No, no, no. You need to go.
Please, John.

764
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,800
- I can't listen to you.
- No, no, no. Just leave.

765
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,440
- Just leave her alone, okay?
- I gave you a chance, didn't I?

766
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,800
I didn't ask you for it, did I?

767
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,520
Chill out! I don't want to talk to you,
I want to talk to her!

768
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,720
Listen, get off me, yeah? I'm
a policeman, all right? I'm a policeman.

769
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,960
See there, what does it say? It says
I'm above your rank, now back off!

770
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,240
I just want to talk
to my wife, that's it!

771
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,600
Wait, wait, please wait.

772
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,840
Zoe, I just want to talk to you,
that's all.

773
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,920
Just you. I don't want all this.

774
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,880
Okay.

775
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,520
Look.

776
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,680
I know you have to be
where you need to be.

777
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,960
All right? I can accept that.

778
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
I'll respect it, okay?

779
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,280
I still love you.

780
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,120
And I'm sorry, all right?

781
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,320
Don't apologise.

782
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,680
Don't be sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

783
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,440
All right? All right, mate?

784
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,760
Take me away.

785
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,880
- Hello, John.
- Alice. You may be very, very clever.

786
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,120
But you're wrong.
There is love in the world.

787
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,880
So you lose.

788
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,280
- Excuse me, miss. Can I help?
- No.

789
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,320
