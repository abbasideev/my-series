1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,880
You're gonna fall, Henry.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,080
Please.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Please!

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,680
Alice Morgan is a malignant narcissist.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,440
This is about prestige,
power, self-affirmation.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,600
She killed her parents.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,560
No forensics, no witnesses.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,720
Send her home!

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,096
I still love you, Zoe.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
You care more about
the dead than the living.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,840
That's where your heart is.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Do you love him?

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,520
I didn't ask you for it, did I?

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
-Hello, John.
Alice.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,800
You may be very, very clever.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,920
But you're wrong.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,280
There is love in the world.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,480
So you lose.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,800
Lima Sierra 219 to Control.
Confirm, we do have a white male down.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,280
Mid 20s, possible gunshot wounds, over.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,336
Received, Lima Sierra 219.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,880
Ambulance en route,
ETA four minutes, over.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,000
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,440
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,680

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160

♪ Will never love you again ♪

28
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Thank you for coming in so early.

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
As you know, DCI Luther
Is facing a charge of assault

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
occasioning actual bodily harm.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
These are matters we take
very seriously indeed.

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,760
But I need to know from you,
Mr North, without prejudice

33
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,880
exactly what happened yesterday.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Did DCI Luther assault you?

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,920
Look, uh, the truth is...

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,360
DCI Luther was defending himself.

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm not proud to tell you this,
but I threw the first punch.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,680
And, um, quite honestly,
I thought the police were heavy handed.

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,600
I will ask you to sign
a statement to this effect.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
That's why I'm here.

41
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,920
This is DI John Luther,
leave a message.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
I know how hard that was for you.

43
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm fine.

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,800
I might work from home today, though.

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Thank you.

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,960
You might want to try
answering your phone.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,240
Get a reputation for answering
phones and all they do is ring.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,360
You've spoken to Zoe?

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,280
- No.
- Ah, well.

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,040
Then, you should know that
Mark North gave you a pass.

51
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,640
He's not pressing charges.

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,280
So how about we finish
this chat away from the edge?

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you never do this?

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,920
Come up to a really high place and
wonder what it would be like just...

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,920
- to fall?
- Fall or jump?

56
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
- Same thing.
- I beg to differ.

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,200
But, mostly I go home, watch
America's Next Top Model.

58
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Do you not worry you're on the
devil's side without even knowing it?

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
No.

60
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,280
- Just let it go, John.
- I already let him go.

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,640
Just didn't finish the job
off properly, did I?

62
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
- And nobody shed a tear.
- That doesn't make it right.

63
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,320
Makes it a little bit
less wrong, though.

64
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,640
So, you going to jump?

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Probably not.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
Well, then I'm bored of this game.

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,760
You going back to the factory?

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,320
I've been on 18 hours straight.

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm going home, mate. You should try it.

70
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I might.

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
Or I might not.

72
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,520
This is Mike Eppley.

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,320
Over here, this is Steve Gorman.

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
Yeah.

75
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,480
- You knew them?
- A little bit.

76
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,040
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,920
If you see Gorman and Eppley,
you go blind. See the scene.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Tell me what you see.

79
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Right. Well, Gorman
was shot at close range.

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
Double tap to the chest.

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,440
Entry wounds are two-three inches apart.

82
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,520
That's good shooting, that is.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,640
And this blood here,
it's real but it won't be the shooter's.

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,040
It looks staged to me.

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Staged. Look, look, look.

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,640
This is an execution.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,376
There can't be. There's no
way the shooter would know

88
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,816
that Gorman and Eppley
would attend this call-out.

89
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,320
No, I didn't say he was
targeting Gorman and Eppley.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
I said it was an execution.

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
I don't understand what that means.

92
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Nor do I. Excuse me, bag that.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,280
Grab that. Thank you.

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
All right.

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,960
Morning, Corinne.

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
Any suspects, John? Off the record?

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,680
- You've got my number.
- Yeah, memorised. Six, six, six.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Direct line.

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,360
- Anything?
- Yeah, yeah. Could be.

100
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,600
Cobden Lane links Northlight
Road and Stockwood Hill

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
- here to here. Yeah?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,920
Less than three minutes after the
shooting, this man crossed the road

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,336
half a kilometre from
the Stockwood Hill exit.

104
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Is that it?

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,000
- Well, we're lucky to get that.
- Yeah, where does he go?

106
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,896
Um, ducks behind shops on Hamilton Row.
Behind that, there's another lane.

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Gives out onto allotments,
gardens, a canal.

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,240
No more CCTV?

109
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,120
No. Coverage is spotty at best.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,016
Plus, a lot of cameras
in the area have been vandalised.

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,240
Vandalised, when?

112
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,640
Uh, well, four were
reported down...

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,520
Four went down Monday night.

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Yeah, the shooter would have
taken them out, wouldn't he?

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,336
All right, so we need to
review the footage going back seven days

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
before the sabotage, see if we can't
find our man on his recce.

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
Can I hear that 999 call again?

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Yeah.

119
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,440
There's been a shooting,

120
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,280
a man's lying face down
at the north end of Cobden Lane.

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,440
Yeah, listen to that,
that's a very efficient call.

122
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,480
No ambiguity,
just essential information.

123
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,600
People leaving crime scenes, yeah,

124
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,040
they hunch, look at the
ground, avoid eye-contact.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,960
Look at him, straight back,
square shoulders.

126
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,640
He's alert, he's calm,
he's aware of his surroundings.

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,600
I bet you any money,
he's armed forces.

128
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,320
What, you get that from this?

129
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,456
You ever been in a pub or bar,
whatever, and you know,

130
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
you just know the guy
next to you is a copper?

131
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Yeah, well, I grew up around soldiers.

132
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
The way he walks, talks, shoots.

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
That's a soldier.

134
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
All right, so we need to
look up army personnel

135
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,656
that have suffered
at the hands of the police.

136
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,040
Dig up aggravated arrest
complaints filed by veterans

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
on behalf of themselves,
friends, family, all right?

138
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,680
It'll be a long list.

139
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,616
Those soldiers coming back
from war don't find it easy.

140
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,856
They get depressed, they drink,
they fight, they get arrested.

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Justin, this was an execution.

142
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,136
I'm not saying the assassin
was targeting Gorman and Eppley.

143
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,800
But I'm saying, what if he was
targeting their uniforms?

144
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Hmm?

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
Right, I get it. I'm on it.

146
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
What do you want?

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,000
I've been reading
Bertrand Russell to a friend of yours.

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,200
"Often, the good suffer,
and the wicked prosper,

149
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,600
"and one hardly knows which
of those is the more annoying."

150
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,120
What are you talking about?
Where... Where are you?

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
If only he could speak.

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
What tales he could tell.

153
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
What are you playing at, Alice?

154
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,240
- I'm investigating you.
- I don't know what that means.

155
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
What it means?

156
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
I am curious about how Henry
came to be here like this.

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
Well there's no need to be curious.

158
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
He killed children,
he tried to run away, I caught him,

159
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
he fell

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
And who actually believes that?

161
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,600
Everyone that matters.

162
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
Zoe, for example?

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Yes.

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,480
- Because do you know what I think?
- I can't imagine.

165
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,640
I think you gave in to your true nature,

166
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,640
Just for a second, and let him fall.

167
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,000
And you couldn't take it.
You gave in to guilt and self-loathing.

168
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
How am I doing?

169
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,160
Not so well.

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,976
But mostly, you were terrified that Zoe
might discover what you'd done

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,800
and learn what kind of man
you actually are.

172
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,080
You don't know anything about
me, let alone my marriage.

173
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,080
Well, I can always ask her myself.
See what she says.

174
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,360
Alice, I know this is
Just a sport to you,

175
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
but you need to stop.

176
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,320
Just stop.

177
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
Don't go anywhere near Zoe.
Anywhere near her.

178
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,760
And don't say a word about this to
anyone, do you understand me?

179
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Why, exactly?

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you scared of what
I'll find out or what she will?

181
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,400
Hey, have we got anything?

182
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,840
Half a dozen
names hit key markers.

183
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,840
Mostly drunk and disorderly,
aggravated assault.

184
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,760
But I'm thinking,
"Nah, it's not enough for our boy."

185
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,816
All right, then, we'll broaden
the search parameters.

186
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,120
Go back to veterans from the first Gulf
War, Northern Ireland, Falklands...

187
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,960
He's in there somewhere.

188
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,536
Police say the
killer is armed and extremely dangerous.

189
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,000
Members of the public who see him should
not attempt to apprehend him,

190
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,280
but immediately dial 999.
Police, at present,

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,920
are refusing to comment
on a possible motive for the murders,

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,456
but wish to re-assure the public
that they are doing everything

193
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,920
possible to catch the killer.

194
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,040
Terry Lynch.
Ex-46 Commando, Royal Marines.

195
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Decorated veteran.

196
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Eighteen months ago, killed a police
officer while resisting an arrest.

197
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,360
Yeah, I remember this.
Dennis Sorrel. Decent bloke.

198
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,200
Lynch was in a bar,
got into an argument.

199
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,240
Sorrel was the first responder,
tried to calm things down.

200
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,680
- Lynch glassed him. Sorrel bled out.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,080
And Lynch pleaded "combat stress”.

202
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,776
That's maybe not
so mad as it sounds.

203
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,720
About 10% of the prison population
is comprised of veterans,

204
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,120
12,000 from Iraq and Afghanistan.

205
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,080
I don't care what Terry Lynch
did at Goose Green, Desert Storm,

206
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,640
Operation Enduring Freedom.

207
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,960
It doesn't give him
a free pass to kill coppers!

208
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,040
Anyway, he can't be our man.
He's inside. "Life without possibility."

209
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
Well, this is his son, Owen Lynch.

210
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Also 46 Commando.
Returned from Afghanistan last year.

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
Forced to leave under
"administrative discharge,"

212
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
which means he had
mental health issues.

213
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,720
- Army left him high and dry.
- Got an address?

214
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,680
Uh, statement from his wife, Rachel.

215
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
She threw him out because, "The man who
came back wasn't the man who left."

216
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,736
Yeah, well, he's taken it out on her
once too often, she's thrown him out.

217
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
And that was the last time
he showed up on the radar,

218
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
until Gorman and Eppley last night.

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,360
Gorman and Eppley had nothing to do
with his father being sent down?

220
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,640
No.

221
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,200
Is this as bad as it sounds?

222
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah, false alarm. Prank call.
That's me done for the day.

223
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,480
Put the kettle on, over.

224
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,120
Boss! We've got another officer down.
Harthill Estate.

225
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Come on!

226
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Where was the shooter?

227
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,416
As far as we could establish,
he turned the corner

228
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,480
into the street down here.

229
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,016
He just walked right up and shot her.

230
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
- Point blank?
- In the abdomen.

231
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,320
- This isn't right.
- Sir?

232
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Well, last night,
he fires four perfect shots in the dark.

233
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,640
And today, in broad daylight,
he messes up and leaves Hanson alive.

234
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
That's not right.

235
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,360
It's not right, it's not right.

236
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Oh, no.

237
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,960
Everyone, take cover!

238
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Mother...

239
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,600
After an unprecedented six fatalities

240
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,920
in less than 24 hours, there is
a sense on the streets of London

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,200
that the police presence
is being greatly reduced

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,920
in response to these killings.

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Despite the Metropolitan Police's
strident denials,

244
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
can the emergency services
afford to maintain

245
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,200
their 9-9-9 response commitment
to ordinary people of the capital?

246
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,080
This is Corinne Day, BBC News, London.

247
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
- You all right?
- Yeah.

248
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,240
No. I've never been shot at before.

249
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,360
You know, there's people
you can speak to these days.

250
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
If you need to.

251
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,320
- What, like a counsellor?
- Yeah. Why not?

252
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,720
If my dad knew if I'd seen a counsellor,
he'd shoot me himself.

253
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,600
All right, everyone.
Roll up, roll up.

254
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,560
Orders from on high.

255
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,440
All personnel will be issued with
bullet-proof vests, where available.

256
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,656
Now, I know "where available"
isn't what you want to hear,

257
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,240
but it's the best we can do,
there we go.

258
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,520
Any questions?

259
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920
Good.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,520
Now, this has been a bad day.

261
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
The worst day most of us
have seen on the job.

262
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,760
Looking around, I'm reminded that many
of us are bedraggled old fossils

263
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,680
with quite a few bad days behind us.

264
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,560
So, what we're going to do,
ladies and gents,

265
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,480
is sniff out this bastard,

266
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,560
then show him and the rest of the world
that no one can do this to us.

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
So, let's get out there and get him.

268
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's have it, then!

269
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,024
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,760
My name is Owen Lynch,
ex-46 Commandos, Royal Marines.

271
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,920
This is my dad...

272
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,320
Terry Lynch,

273
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,160
also 46 Commando, Royal Marines.

274
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,280
He was at Bluff Cove when they shot
down an Argentine jet using rifles.

275
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,320
After that he did two tours
in County Armagh.

276
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
His final tour was in
the Helmand province.

277
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,280
Last year, he went to prison for a crime
that would never have been committed

278
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,760
if this country had given him
the respect that he deserved.

279
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,440
But that doesn't happen.

280
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,800
More men who served in the Falklands
have committed suicide since

281
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,200
than died in the war itself.

282
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,120
That may soon be true
of men serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

283
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,800
My dad was defending himself
from a belligerent arrest.

284
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
He shouldn't be in prison for murder.

285
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,920
Police officers will continue
to die until justice is done.

286
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
No negotiations will be entered into,

287
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,960
and there will be no
further communication from me.

288
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
Freedom for Terry Lynch.

289
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,720
How many views so far?

290
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,080
Thirty thousand and counting.

291
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,240
All major news media outlets
have picked up on it.

292
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,200
It's out there, it's not coming back.

293
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,560
He hardly mentions himself.

294
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,080
Does that not strike you as weird?

295
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,160
I mean, he's just got
back from the war,

296
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,800
his life's in shreds, but this
whole declaration's about

297
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,960
what his dad's done and what his dad's
achieved, where his dad served.

298
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,760
Find out whether
Owen has visited Terry Lynch in prison.

299
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,440
Sir.

300
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
I've got to get this.

301
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,080
Stop stalking me, Alice,
you're yesterday's news.

302
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes, I heard about the dead policemen.

303
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,360
I was worried about you, John.

304
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,680
About what, that someone
else might get me?

305
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
I know how hard men like you
take the death of fellow officers.

306
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,600
It must be like losing family.

307
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm not discussing cases with you.

308
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,520
Not even interesting ones?

309
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,240
This isn't interesting, all right?

310
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,080
These are good cops doing good jobs,

311
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,920
being gunned down
on the streets like...

312
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Like what?

313
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,520
That's something we all do,
isn't it in the end...

314
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,280
Judge who's worth more than whom.

315
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,680
Hitler or Gandhi?

316
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,160
The very young, the very old?

317
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,800
But, to be fair, most of us
don't do it to the extent that you do.

318
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,120
But it does mean the difference between
us is one of degree, not category.

319
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
- Ask Henry Madsen.
- All right, you win, okay?

320
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,800
You're too clever for me, Alice.

321
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,080
Flattery to appease a malignant
narcissist, that's a frivolous tactic.

322
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Are you afraid of me?

323
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,360
- Yes.
- Why?

324
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,216
- You know why.
- Do you want me to leave you alone?

325
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,800
- Yes, I do.
- Then answer my questions.

326
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
- Why?
- To help with my investigation.

327
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,160
I've got means, opportunity.

328
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
You still haven't given me motive.

329
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,560
Why did you let Henry Madsen fall?

330
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
I can't say what you want to hear, okay?

331
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,360
Do you think Zoe could
clarify the situation for me?

332
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,520
Last time you spoke to Zoe,

333
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,440
you shoved a knife in her ear, so I
think she'll be disinclined to chat.

334
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
It wasn't a knife and
I wasn't asking permission.

335
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,080
And believe me, if I pay
her a visit she'll talk.

336
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,840
Hey, listen, I don't
respond well to threats.

337
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,720
Hmm, I think coffee, do you want some?

338
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,920
- Tea.
- Tea? Builder's?

339
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,720
Is it John?

340
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,680
John?

341
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,440
- Have you got a minute?
- Not to argue, I don't.

342
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,480
No, just, I want to ask you something.

343
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,520
Um, I need you to leave London.

344
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,240
Not for long. Just a few days.

345
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Go to your mum and dad's or,
um, Mark's parents, or whatever.

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,480
- What's wrong? Why?
- I've received a viable threat.

347
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,960
- What kind of a threat?
- From Alice Morgan.

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,760
He's playing mind games, right?
It's a control thing.

349
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,160
He wants to control you. He always did.

350
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,760
You don't know him!

351
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,160
It's pathetic. Honestly...
What is he going to do next?

352
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,400
Is he going to bang you on the head,
drag you to a cave by the hair?

353
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,376
Do you like this kind of thing?

354
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,960
This controlling, macho bullshit?

355
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,560
I can't believe you're
being so childish about this.

356
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,360
I can't believe you let this man
turn you into such an arsehole.

357
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,040
- He received a threat.
- Says him.

358
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,560
Oh, come on, we're not
interrogating your masculinity here!

359
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,880
Yeah, well, we don't have to worry about
that, do we? I'm secure enough

360
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,120
to weather any comparison
you care to make with your ex-husband.

361
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,240
Of course you are. And you shouldn't
be questioning my motives.

362
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,280
It's just...
Look, John knows this stuff,

363
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,576
and if he thinks we should leave,

364
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,040
I honestly think we should
take him seriously.

365
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,160
- Do you know what I think?
- What, this last half hour wasn't it?

366
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
You know what I think?

367
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,056
If there was a threat...
If there was a threat,

368
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,640
a genuine threat to your safety,

369
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,480
there would already
be a security detail outside the door.

370
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,560
Zoe, the police look after
their own. He's lying.

371
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,480
I don't know why he's lying,
but he's lying.

372
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,960
That's really not fair.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, a simple solution.

374
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,520
Why don't we just pick up
the phone and dial his boss?

375
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,640
See what she thinks about this threat.

376
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,920
- I got what you wanted.
- Footage from the prison?

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
Okay, so you look here at Owen Lynch's
most recent visit to his dad,

378
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,560
should be just over
two weeks ago. No audio, of course.

379
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,120
No hugs. No smiles.

380
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,280
Owen's nervous. Whatever Terry's saying,

381
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
Owen's finding it profoundly stressful.

382
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,960
When did Terry lose his appeal?

383
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
Uh, about a month ago.

384
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
So this is, what, two weeks ago?

385
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
Yeah.

386
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,360
Do you know what we're looking at?

387
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,040
We're looking at Owen
receiving his orders.

388
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,240
Crikey.

389
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Don't tell me.

390
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,280
I've got a visitor.

391
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Gotcha.

392
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
Right, you brief John,
I'll trace this number.

393
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Two schoolgirls are coming home
from Sunday school one day,

394
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,640
and one turns to the other
and says, "Do you believe in the devil?"

395
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,120
The other one says,
"Don't be silly, of course not.

396
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,000
"The devil's like Santa.

397
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,040
"It's only your dad."

398
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,400
I always thought that was funny.

399
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,400
The thing is about little boys
is that they

400
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
worship their dads like gods.

401
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,640
The more invisible he is,

402
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,520
the more arbitrary in his
punishment and rewards,

403
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,640
the more they crave his approval.

404
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,200
I know what it must
be like for Owen. My dad was a soldier.

405
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,400
1st Armoured Division,
7th Armoured Brigade.

406
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,320
So, Germany, mostly.

407
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,040
Canada, a little bit of Cyprus.

408
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,160
I bet your old man was a right
old hard bastard, wasn't he?

409
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,680
Well, see, it was tough for him, you
see. 'Cause here I am, a big lad,

410
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,440
eager to please,

411
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,320
wanting to care about
the things he cared about,

412
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,240
Army, sports.

413
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,920
No, there was nothing.

414
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
He wanted me to box,

415
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,360
and I just wanted to read
books, write, meet girls.

416
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,000
In the end, I just gave up
trying to make him proud,

417
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,200
‘cause I just knew
it was never going to happen.

418
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,640
But this daft bastard,
he hasn't given up, though, has he?

419
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,160
More than anything,
he just wants to make his dad proud.

420
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
Now, Terry,

421
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,600
I know you gave him a job to do,

422
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,200
but I don't think you quite
appreciate the implications.

423
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,680
In crimes like this,
half the offenders end up

424
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,160
shooting themselves in the face
and the other half get shot by police.

425
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,400
Your boy's going to die
unless you help him.

426
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Oh, yeah?

427
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
By doing what?

428
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,080
Go on camera.
Tell him to stop. Rescind the order.

429
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
All right, I could do that, yeah.

430
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
- But?
- I need a reduction in sentence.

431
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
That's not going to happen,
Terry. You killed a police officer.

432
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
I'm not asking for a pardon.
I'm asking for a reduction.

433
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,400
I got life for murder.

434
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,720
It should've been five
years for manslaughter, with diminished.

435
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,920
Now, I'll take that, with time served.

436
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,800
Even if there was a precedent,
there'd be no time.

437
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,496
I don't know about that, 'cause Owen can
look after himself, can't he?

438
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,640
He could be out there
for weeks, mate, before you catch him.

439
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,360
- Weeks and weeks...
- This is your son we're talking about!

440
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,320
And you're sitting
in here, killing him.

441
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,496
Not if you give me what I want.

442
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,000
You're not getting what you want!

443
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,280
Five years with time served
and transfer to an open prison.

444
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Now, if you can do that for me,

445
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,040
you can come back and you can bring

446
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,320
all the cameras that you want.

447
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,360
Boss, we've triangulated the signal.

448
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Static? Mobile?

449
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,880
No movement.
He's keeping his head down.

450
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,160
Sensible boy.

451
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,776
This is Teller. We've got a
possible location for Owen Lynch.

452
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,720
We need to scramble
Tactical Support. Address?

453
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,096
We found a SIM card,
one number listed in the contacts.

454
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,760
Belongs to a pay-as-you-go,
which we've traced to 185 Ellwyn Mews.

455
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,560
That's a vacant property,
overlooked by a trading estate.

456
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,920
Commercial buildings.
Makes for a decent bolt hole.

457
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,360
Owen Lynch won't let himself
get caught. He'd rather die.

458
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,440
Yeah, and nobody seems to be having
much of a problem with that.

459
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,200
Are you worried about something?

460
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,440
Getting shot at, mostly.

461
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,760
That's it, is it?

462
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,000
Be a good boy. Use your words.

463
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
It's just, I've been thinking.

464
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,280
- What?
- One number on the SIM card.

465
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,320
- One number.
- One number, one son.

466
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,520
Yeah, I know, but it's niggling me.

467
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,336
On a day like this, if all you've got is
a niggle, you're laughing, mate.

468
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,440
I know, but you're in prison,

469
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,600
got nothing else
to think about but one number,

470
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,000
one important number.

471
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,280
Well, you memorise it, don't you?

472
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,560
You don't write it down.
You memorise it.

473
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,720
Ian, we've got a Special Forces nut job
out there gunning down uniforms.

474
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,120
And this phone is our sole lead.
And we don't ignore leads.

475
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,240
So, all we can do is
go in hard and noisy

476
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
and as ready as is
humanly possible to be.

477
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,816
We let Tactical do their job,
and when it's done, we buy them a drink

478
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
and tell them their biceps are sexy.

479
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,600
Done?

480
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,640
- Yeah.
- Good, let's go.

481
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Armed police! Lay down your weapons!

482
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,320
Armed police! Lay down your weapons!

483
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Room clear! Room clear! Room clear!

484
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,480
Get out! Get out!

485
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,960
Oh, my God, get out!

486
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,520
Repeat,
CO19 were in the building. People lost.

487
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,880
Get them all ambulances,
and get them now.

488
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,120
C019?

489
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
Four confirmed, six injured.

490
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,576
Well, if there's one thing you learn

491
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,120
from being in Iraq,
it's how to make an IED.

492
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,320
- Lynch?
- Still searching.

493
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,640
Helicopters, ground units,
dogs, door to door.

494
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
No sign.

495
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,120
But it was a remote-detonated bomb.

496
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
He had to be close by, watching.

497
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,400
I mean that puts him within
500 metres, line of sight.

498
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,136
I don't get it.
How could he just slip away like that?

499
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,400
All right, it's not your fault.

500
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,400
He wanted us
to find that SIM card.

501
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,920
I bit down on it like a...

502
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,680
Mars bar. Of course it's my fault.

503
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,680
It's official.

504
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,520
As of five minutes ago,

505
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,080
the Owen Lynch operation
was passed up to Anti-Terrorism.

506
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
It's out of our hands.

507
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,360
All they're gonna do
is give Terry Lynch what he wants.

508
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,640
More blood. More dead coppers.
We can't let him do that.

509
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,520
I don't have much choice, do I?

510
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
Look, we don't have
to like it, but we do have to accept it.

511
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,680
We're off the case.
Suck it up, move on.

512
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,000
Where are you going?

513
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
Guyv.

514
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,400
- What's this now?
- Eppley's radio.

515
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,600
Right, listen, we use Airwave,
right? Secure, digital.

516
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,760
It's impossible for civilians
to buy a scanner and listen in.

517
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,880
And?

518
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,520
Owen swapped them.

519
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,760
He swapped it.
You need to call Anti-Terrorism,

520
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,600
and tell them he's listening
to everything we say.

521
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Okay, I need you to understand,
Detective Chief Inspector,

522
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,160
that to alert them is all we can do.

523
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,440
We can't act on this information
because this case is no longer ours.

524
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,456
All right? Am I being transparent, here?
Tell me if I'm being at all ambiguous.

525
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,576
Because there's nothing
we can do with this, except pass it on.

526
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,480
There's nothing we can do
‘cause no one knows where Owen Lynch is.

527
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,760
And he's going to keep killing until
someone finds him and stops him.

528
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,920
They'll find him.

529
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
Oh, yeah? How?

530
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,640
So, here's what's gonna happen.
Anti-Terrorism's gonna go in

531
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,760
big and noisy and Owen dies.

532
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,960
Yeah, well, then, he dies happy,
doesn't he, doing the job he loves.

533
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,176
That's more than
most of us get, isn't it?

534
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,640
Yeah, that's gonna be
a damn sight more than you're gonna get.

535
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,280
What's that then, eh?
You going to bash me up, are you?

536
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,296
Or do you think I can't take a slap?

537
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, I'm sure you can take a slap.

538
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,280
I'm going to send my boy for you.

539
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,880
Yeah, you know, picture the
scene, doorbell rings, click, bang!

540
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
Your skull goes splat, straight out.

541
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,320
So, go on then, do your worst.

542
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,240
I'd really like to.

543
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,520
But murdering people leaves
a lot of fuss and bother behind.

544
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,800
So, I thought,
"No, there's got to be another way."

545
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,000
Now, I know a lot of
people in this prison.

546
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
Lot of screws, lot of inmates,
lot of nasty people, really.

547
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,560
But they don't bother you.

548
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,616
Because the thing about you, Terry, is
that you're a hard bastard, aren't you?

549
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,680
Mmm?

550
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,920
I mean, you can't be
seen giving into threats

551
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,416
‘cause then you wouldn't
be a hard bastard any more, would you?

552
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,360
And you'd rather die than lose all the
respect that you've earned in here.

553
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,280
I'm gonna strip you of that dignity

554
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,120
and make you the most
reviled prisoner in here.

555
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,120
Oh, I'd like to see you try.

556
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,080
I'm so glad you said that

557
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,440
because everyone
knows I searched your cell.

558
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,640
It would be the easiest thing in the
world to show them that this

559
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,840
is what we found.

560
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,040
- Yeah?
- Go on, have a look.

561
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,360
What've you been up to,
you wonky bastard, eh?

562
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,120
Go on.

563
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,840
I have to tell you,
I haven't been able to

564
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,880
take a look at them myself, but I am
told that none of those little boys

565
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,160
are more than nine years old.

566
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,120
It's giving you
that little thrill, isn't it?

567
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,600
Oh, all right.
There's Terry Lynch the hard man.

568
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,880
But now there's Terry Lynch the nunce.

569
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,040
No, no, no one would believe it.

570
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,480
No one, right? That's what
I thought, no one,

571
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
but then I thought to myself,
"Terry's got a boy."

572
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,320
A boy.

573
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,560
And he can get his boy
to do anything he tells him.

574
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
Hey, even kill cops.

575
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,680
What do you have to do

576
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,720
to a boy to get him to do that,
eh? To have that kind of control?

577
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,320
Terry, will you tell me?

578
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,280
What did you do to young Owen?
What did you do?

579
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,400
You're a piece of shit! Ain't you?

580
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,840
This is a onetime deal, Terry.

581
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,440
One time only.
So, you better give me what I want.

582
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,640
Have you left yet?

583
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,080
No, we're still here.

584
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,480
What, I don't believe it. Why?

585
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,600
John, it's illegal
to threaten someone's life.

586
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,480
If Alice Morgan threatened me,
why don't you just arrest her?

587
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,080
- I can't, okay?
- Why not?

588
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,760
- It's complicated.
- It always is.

589
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,760
What's this woman got on you?
What have you done?

590
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,680
Listen, I haven't got
time for this, all right.

591
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,280
I just need you to trust me.

592
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Thing is, I'm not sure I do.

593
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,240
If I called Rose Teller,
would she know about this?

594
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,440
- Have you called her?
- Not yet.

595
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Should I?

596
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,800
No, don't do that. Don't call her.

597
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,160
Well, that tells me
everything, doesn't it?

598
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,880
So, what's really going on?
What have you done?

599
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,120
Listen, I need you
to trust me, all right?

600
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,080
At the very least, I need you to lock
your doors, lock your windows.

601
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,080
And if anything happens,
you call me immediately, all right?

602
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,720
So, you were right.

603
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,080
He's lying.

604
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,280
I've had 20 years.

605
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,160
When do I learn, it's 20 years.

606
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,280
God, I'm sorry.

607
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,040
I'm so sorry.

608
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,080
When does this go out?

609
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,960
Lead story, main bulletin,
say ten past 10:00.

610
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,760
- Definitely sure about this?
- Yeah.

611
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,160
Okay, let's go.

612
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,920
And we're rolling.

613
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,256
And as night falls on a stunned capital

614
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,480
as the police, ambulance

615
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,400
and fire crews respond
to 999 calls in full body armour...

616
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Thank you.

617
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,936
Corrine Day has been
talking to Detective Chief Inspector

618
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,040
- fohn Luther.
- Hmm?

619
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,576
- Senior Investigating Officer...
- What?

620
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
0f the so-called 999 shootings.

621
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,176
Detective Chief
Inspector Luther,

622
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,560
what do we know about
Owen Lynch's motivation?

623
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,600
We know that Owen prides himself

624
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,800
on being a soldier
from a long line of soldiers,

625
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,120
but we've interviewed his
commanding officers, military doctors,

626
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
- psychiatrists...
- Holy shit.

627
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,200
Oh, no, no, no! Sergeant Ripley!

628
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,720
Owen had an impressive
number of kills to his name.

629
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,560
They were very aware
of his character flaws.

630
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,736
What flaws are they?

631
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,720
Well Owen was never soldier material.

632
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,000
He was a, uh, maladjusted child who was
raised on too much TV and video games.

633
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,400
Is any of this even true?

634
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,560
- Not even slightly.
- What we do know,

635
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,200
um, is that on his return
from Afghanistan,

636
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,240
Owen developed severe
sexual difficulties, and, uh, despite

637
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,520
his claims on a so-called mission,
it's quite likely that these murders

638
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,240
are a sexual release.

639
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,240
A way of dealing with
his sexual and personal demons.

640
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,160
God, what's he doing?

641
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,320
He's making
himself into a target,

642
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,960
drawing Lynch's fire from
the police force in general.

643
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,440
This is suicide.

644
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,520
And partly because his dad isn't quite
the hero he'd have us believe.

645
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,680
His dad is an alcoholic.
All right? A wife beater.

646
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,120
Who, incidentally, denies all
knowledge of his son's activities.

647
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,320
And how close
did you say you were to catching him?

648
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,696
Corinne, I've just had a long
conversation with his dad,

649
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,360
who has provided me with vital
information and, uh...

650
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,480
Owen, you'll see me soon.

651
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,880
Thank you,
Corinne, and now to other news.

652
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,240
Prime Minister...

653
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,440
What's that?

654
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
Mmm.

655
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,240
Alice Morgan.

656
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,160
A friend of John's.

657
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,880
We've met before, actually.

658
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,640
Leave, right now, please.

659
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,880
Or...

660
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,760
Well, go ahead.
But it won't be good for John.

661
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,000
Bollocks to John.

662
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,360
So, how can we help you?

663
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,360
I've been wondering,
why do you think he does it?

664
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,840
- Why does who do what?
- John. His job.

665
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,800
It takes such a toll.

666
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,320
Why does he put himself through it?

667
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,616
I don't see how this is relevant.

668
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,600
Well, it is. Right this second,
you might actually be helping him.

669
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,080
What do you think compels him to do it?

670
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,680
He believes one life is all we have.

671
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,440
Life and love.

672
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,280
Whoever takes life steals everything.

673
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,160
- And do you agree?
- I don't know.

674
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,536
I think if he'd read
a different book by a different writer

675
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,200
at just the right time in his life,
he'd have been a different man.

676
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
He'd have been happier
as a priest than...

677
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,360
Than what?

678
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,800
Than what he is.

679
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,760
It must have been difficult for you.

680
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,880
Impossible, really.

681
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,640
How does anyone compete
with a calling like that?

682
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,920
He wasn't blind.

683
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,936
He knew what it was costing him.

684
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,680
What, like his marriage?

685
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,360
That's part of it, yeah.

686
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,040
- But you don't sound bitter.
- I'm not bitter. I'm...

687
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
I'm proud of him.

688
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,760
You just don't
want to be married to him.

689
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
Not any more, no.

690
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,880
Why not?

691
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,560
I'm not going to answer that.

692
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
Is jt because he tried
to kill Henry Madsen?

693
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,520
- No.
- But that is what you believe.

694
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,280
Do you know what Henry Madsen did?

695
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,400
I have some idea, yes.

696
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,400
He was a freak of nature.

697
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,800
Anyone would be tempted.

698
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,520
We're not talking about anyone,
we're talking about John.

699
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,200
Do you think he tried to kill
him on behalf of the dead?

700
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
Well...

701
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,080
I think that answers the question.

702
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,040
It was lovely meeting you both.

703
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,360
Thank you for your time.

704
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,880
Oh, my God.

705
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,320
- He seriously told you nothing?
- He seriously told me nothing.

706
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,200
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

707
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,320
Shit!

708
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,160
Detective Chief
Inspector John Luther to Control. Over.

709
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
Boss!

710
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,000
Detective Chief Inspector
John Luther to Control. Over.

711
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,400
This is Control, DCI Luther.

712
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,880
What is your status? Over.

713
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm en route to the
Kings Hill Estate. Over.

714
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,840
Please clarify. Over.

715
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,160
There's a flat there that belonged
to one of Terry Lynch's old pals.

716
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,080
Owen used to visit
it when he was a boy.

717
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,840
Now, I'm betting that he's been there,
maybe left something behind

718
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,360
that we can use to find him. Over.

719
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Well, hang back on that. Do not proceed
unassisted to the Kings Hill Estate.

720
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,880
This is now a matter for Anti-Terrorism.
Do not proceed.

721
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,600
Repeat, do not proceed to
the Kings Hill Estate. Over.

722
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,720
Negative.

723
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,080
I'm three minutes away.

724
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,360
I repeat. I am three
minutes away. Over.

725
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,880
We cannot provide armed
backup. Do you read me?

726
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,640
We cannot provide armed backup. Over.

727
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,560
Get CO19 out there.

728
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,920
This is DCI Reed.

729
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,840
We need a first response
tactical unit to the Kings Hill Estate.

730
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,040
It's Owen Lynch.

731
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,760
We have an unarmed, unassisted
officer going in there, so do it now!

732
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,840
He wanted to guarantee that Owen Lynch
overheard him when he made that call.

733
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,080
He brought Eppley's radio to me
so I'd warn Anti-Terrorism

734
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,840
and they'd shut down their comms.

735
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,600
We cleared the airwaves for him.

736
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,560
He's made Owen Lynch hate him.

737
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,800
It's like he's waving a white flag,
stepping onto enemy territory.

738
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,000
As if he's going there to...

739
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,040
- What?
- Boss.

740
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
What?

741
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,920
I found John up on the roof
this morning. Right on the edge.

742
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
So?

743
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,400
It's just...

744
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,200
I'm not completely sure
he expects to walk away from this.

745
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,160
- C0197?
- ETA, 13 minutes.

746
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,920
That's not quick enough.

747
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,560
He's dead. The bloody idiot, he's dead.

748
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Luther, is it?

749
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,800
John. Yeah.

750
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,640
Why are you here, John?

751
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,760
Because I want you to stop.

752
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,000
You ex-services? You look it.

753
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,160
A lot of coppers are.

754
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,240
Mike Eppley, the man you killed
the other night. He was. But me?

755
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,280
No, I...

756
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,600
I grew up around it.

757
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,640
Lace your hands on
top of your head, John.

758
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,120
- You got a death wish?
- No.

759
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,240
Then what?

760
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,120
Oh, God!

761
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,520
Oh, God!

762
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,480
Terry... Terry gave you up, Owen.

763
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,800
I threatened him and he cried
and sobbed like a girl.

764
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,120
And he begged me not to hurt him.

765
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,000
And he just gave you up.
Just like that.

766
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,160
- You liar.
- Ah!

767
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,040
Oh...

768
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,280
You're right.

769
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,840
I am lying. He didn't cry
and he didn't sob.

770
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,840
I just said that to
make you feel better.

771
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,600
No, he just gave you up
because he was frightened.

772
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,680
Hey. Hey!

773
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,200
God!

774
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,280
Oh!

775
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,920
Come on. Owen.

776
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,840
How do you think I knew you were here?

777
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,440
How do you think I found you, eh?

778
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,240
Who else knew you were here?

779
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,320
You didn't... You didn't even
want to be a soldier, did you?

780
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,400
Eh?

781
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,800
You used to piss your bed,
at 11 years old, piss your bed,

782
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,400
and Daddy used to come
in and beat you for it.

783
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,080
And the more he hit you,
the more you pissed your bed.

784
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,680
And you were scared, weren't you?

785
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,496
You were scared of him,
scared of the dogs, scared of...

786
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,640
Shut up!

787
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,000
Get down now! On your face!

788
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,160
Get down! On your knees.
On your knees, get on your knees.

789
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,480
No!

790
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,800
- Get down!
- I told him.

791
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,880
I said, "You're killing your boy!"

792
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,480
You know what he said?

793
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,120
He said, "Well, at least
he dies doing something he loves.”

794
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,120
You recognise that as
something he's said to you before?

795
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,200
Eh?

796
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,280
You're an embarrassment to him, Owen.

797
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,080
He's ashamed of you.

798
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,560
He's ashamed of you,
he's embarrassed of you.

799
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,920
He asked you to do one
thing, just one thing!

800
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,880
And you couldn't
even do that, could you?

801
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,200
You couldn't do it!

802
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,720
He told me all your secrets.

803
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,760
Just so I could humiliate you.

804
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,840
He even told me that when
you got back from the war,

805
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,280
you pissed your bed even more,
and he started laughing.

806
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,480
That's why I'm here, Owen!

807
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,240
That's why I'm here.

808
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,800
I'm just here to tell you the
type of man that your dad is!

809
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,480
Don't die for him, Owen.
God! Don't die for him.

810
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,160
Not him, not him,

811
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,560
not him.

812
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,880
What do I do?

813
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,880
What do you do?

814
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,720
You come with me.

815
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,320
My dad killed one copper.

816
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,480
Look what happened to him.

817
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,880
Owen, you're not your dad.

818
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,800
You're not your dad.

819
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
No.

820
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,160
I'm not.

821
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
What are you doing?

822
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,920
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

823
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,080
Do you ever get the feeling
that you've been cheated?

824
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,240
Don't!

825
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
Ah!

826
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
All right.

827
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,960
Four down, eh?

828
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,360
Two to go.

829
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,800
Jesus.

830
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,280
Ah!

831
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,680
Stay down! Stay down, stay down!

832
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,040
You'll be all right.

833
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,760
You'll be all right.

834
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Ah!

835
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,280
Okay, Owen,
we know that you're scared.

836
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,200
We know that right now
you feel like you're in enemy territory,

837
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,840
but that's not how it is, okay?

838
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,320
You're protected by the law.

839
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,840
We're not going to hurt you.

840
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,520
We need you to understand
that we're not your enemy.

841
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,960
We know that you're not
responsible for what you did.

842
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,560
Not really. I'd like to
acknowledge that here on record.

843
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,480
In the light of this, we are prepared
to make certain recommendations

844
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,600
when it comes to trial and sentencing.

845
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,280
Owen, as far as we're concerned,
the ultimate responsibility

846
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,440
for the death of these
officers lies with your dad.

847
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,920
It's your dad we want.

848
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,640
But we need your help
if we're going to do that.

849
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,720
If we're going to punish this man for
what he did to you, we need your help.

850
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,760
My name is Owen Lynch.

851
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,080
Sergeant, Royal Marines.

852
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,960
2-5-2-3-3-0-1.

853
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,520
Owen, we're trying to help
you here. Let us help you.

854
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,680
My name is Owen Lynch.

855
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,600
Sergeant, Royal Marines.

856
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,760
- 2-5-2-3-3-0-1.
- Owen.

857
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,600
My name is Owen Lynch.

858
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,880
Sergeant, Royal Marines. 2-5-2-3-3-0-1.

859
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,520
So, what do you have to say
that can't be said on the phone?

860
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,240
If you don't leave Zoe alone, Alice,

861
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
I will kill you.

862
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,840
You'd do that, would you?

863
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,360
If that's what it takes to stop you.

864
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,160
Is that what it took
to stop Henry Madsen?

865
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,440
You need to let it be.

866
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,680
I mean, you really do.

867
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,680
Don't worry, I've concluded
my investigation.

868
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,320
I think I got the right man.

869
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,120
I like her, by the way.

870
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,800
Zoe.

871
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,440
I don't know what that
means coming from your mouth.

872
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,920
She's strong.

873
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,840
She has dignity.

874
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,320
She loves you a great deal.

875
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,040
Well, she has a funny way of showing it.

876
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,120
- She knows what you did.
- How do you mean?

877
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,360
She's always known.

878
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,320
It didn't change anything.

879
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,160
It's not why she left.

880
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,000
You made her watch what it did
to you and never told her why.

881
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,600
She couldn't look at
it any more, what you...

882
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,360
Do to yourself.

883
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,400
She felt she'd lost you to the dead.

884
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,840
Why do you do this?
I don't understand. I'm... I'm lost.

885
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,160
Because we're friends.

886
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,360
I want to make you feel better.

887
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,840
We're not friends.

888
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,016
I don't know what we are,
but we're not friends.

889
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,200
Whatever else has happened,
it's in the past.

890
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,680
The past isn't dead, Alice.
It's not even the past.

891
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,080
Are you still frightened of me?

892
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,640
- Yes.
- Because I have no wish to hurt you

893
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,560
and I certainly have no wish to hurt
Zoe. I think she's admirable.

894
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,320
Are you saying you'll leave her alone?

895
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,320
I need you to leave her alone.

896
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,160
Brownie's honour.

897
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,280
One coffee doesn't make us friends.

898
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,960
We think it's blood.

899
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,000
Change the state of play.

900
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,200
You're a police officer.
What you're doing's wrong.

901
00:56:24,224 --> 00:56:32,224
