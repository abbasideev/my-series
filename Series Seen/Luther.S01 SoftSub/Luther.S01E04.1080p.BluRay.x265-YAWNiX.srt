What?

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,680
Ian.

8
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,280
Three victims in five weeks,
spread across London.

9
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,520
Well, vics two and three
have been picked up on camera,

10
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,320
heading home alone after nights out.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,656
We don't know about Monica yet.

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,600
The first victim died a month ago.
The second came two weeks later.

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,560
The third, a week after that.
And now Monica five days later.

14
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,040
Oh, he's escalating fast.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,160
This ain't just a serial.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,640
This man's on a murder spree.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,760
Three previous victims were found
in Isleworth, Whitton, West Drayfield.

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
All of them were walking home alone.

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,760
Now, the dump sites are far apart,
but broadly similar,

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,000
near trading estates.

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,840
So the Met think our man may have been

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,920
a delivery driver of some sort.
Hence White Van Man.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,440
The Met passed on data taken from
2,000 hours of CCTV footage,

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,360
tracked down and eliminated
all vans and other commercial vehicles

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
within a two kilometre bull's-eye zone.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,200
Those who couldn't be eliminated
were added to the suspect pool.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Tactical Unit 1, under my command,

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
will focus on last night's murder
of Monica Paul.

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
Tactical Unit 2 will be based here
under the command of DCI Luther.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,760
You'll review all existing case evidence

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,440
pertaining to the previous victims.

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,160
Focus on the suspect pool,
eliminate those unidentified vehicles.

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,040
Our man is locked into
a pattern of rapid escalation.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
He's going to kill again, very soon,

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,840
except we are going to catch him
before he gets the chance.

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,720
- You all right in here?
- History of a case like this says

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,520
he's in our database somewhere.

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,920
We just have to prise him out.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I thought it best.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,880
Is he fit enough to be questioned?

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,440
Officially, it's too early to say.

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,960
Unofficially?

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,680
He's looking very good.

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,560
Police arrested two kids yesterday.

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,280
One was drinking battery acid,
the other was eating fireworks.

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
They charged one
and let the other one off.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Hmm!

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,040
Tommy Cooper. Boom, boom.

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,440
It was Basil Brush that said,
"Boom, boom."

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Oops.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,200
Henry Madsen woke up.

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
Are you in trouble?

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,200
Possibly.

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,160
Might be.

55
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,400
Might be in trouble.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,040
I do know that I will be
put under surveillance.

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,800
My movements,
my phone calls... Everything.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
Why?

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,320
I think they're worried that
I might sneak in and finish the job.

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Well, you might be mad,

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
but you're not stupid.

62
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,320
Yeah.

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,720
I can't see you any more.

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,640
I can't talk to you.

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
Sorry.

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,160
You know? I really am.

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,400
But I can't do this any more, not while
this thing is hanging over my head.

68
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,960
- It's over.
- No.

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,320
- Yes, Alice, it's over.
- No.

70
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,760
I've got to go.

71
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,640
Got work to do.

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
- No!
- Yes.

73
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,760
No!

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh!

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Mmm.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,640
- Morning, love.
- Morning.

77
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
- Not yet! I've got dirty hands.
- Oh?

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,320
Grease.

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,000
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, just washing me hands.

80
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,360
Textbook. After the first kill
he goes into the depressive phase,

81
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
can't believe what he's done.

82
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Until the urge builds again,
becomes uncontrollable.

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,200
The cooling off periods
get shorter and shorter,

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,160
but not this quickly,
so what's driving the escalation?

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,640
Do you have any sexual fantasies?

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,000
What? Yeah, none that
I'm going to tell you about.

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,280
Does the reality ever
live up to the fantasy?

88
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,560
I, um...

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,520
Well, no.

90
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,400
- No, not really.
- It can't, can it?

91
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
That doesn't account
for the pace of escalation.

92
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,280
No, no, it doesn't. But, I mean,
we're not looking at a release, here.

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,680
We're looking at an explosion.

94
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,000
Now what makes a man just let go?

95
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,720
The trigger event is usually
some kind of perceived humiliation.

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,600
You know, loss of a job,
loss of a spouse.

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,080
I've got to take this.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,760
20?

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
I just called...

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,680
- You okay?
- I'm great.

101
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,040
Well, I've never had an affair before.
So, I don't know what to do.

102
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,880
Is it still called an affair

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
if I'm sleeping with my wife
behind her lover's back?

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
Look, I've got to go.

105
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Hello, there.

106
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Coffee's on.

107
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,760
You're up early.

108
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

109
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,856
It's been announced that earlier today

110
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,560
the body of a young woman was found

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,600
on a playing field
near Wandsworth Common.

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,096
Talk about
the government's economic...

113
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,360
- Gray? You home, love?
- Yeah, in here.

114
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,200
Happy birthday.

115
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,800

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,280
Of course I haven't, no.

117
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,800
No, no, never.

118
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
Come on, sit...

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,720
Sit down, relax.

120
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,080
Open your present.

121
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,840
Oh, gosh.

122
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,360
Oh, goodness gracious. That's...

123
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,680
It's really lovely.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,240
Put it on.

125
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,040
Can you help me with this?

126
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,800
There you go.

127
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Some of these guys keep news clippings,
photographs, whatever.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,480
- The fact that he likes jewellery...
- Suggests that he's

180
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,640
married, in a relationship.

181
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,760
He'd give the necklace
to his wife, girlfriend.

182
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Every time he sees it,
he's taken back to the kill.

183
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,720
But the suddenness of it?
What sets him off like that?

184
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,400
She's about to leave him.

185
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,680
So it just pushes him over the edge.
We don't need insight into his

186
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,400
tortured soul to understand who he is.

187
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,080
We just need to know who the hell
he is and where the hell he's at.

Sorry, love.
Listen, I've got to go to work.

203
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,480
- That's all right, don't worry.
- Happy birthday!

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,840
You enjoy yourself.

205
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,696
Look after her for me, mate, won't you?
Make sure she has a good time.

206
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
Will do mate, yeah.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,816
Sorry we were running
a bit late tonight, mate.

208
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,080
But, uh, I had to give
her one for her birthday.

209
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,200
You know how she likes it,
good and hard and long.

210
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,440
Tell you the truth,

211
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,200
I'm surprised she can walk.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,840
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you later.

213
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,200
Come on, girls!

214
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,280
Let's see if we can
beat that last one...

215
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
Come on, girls!

216
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,360
So why was she walking home by herself?

217
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,736
She was meeting friends
in the pub to talk about the hen night.

218
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,440
She's happy, she's engaged,
she's on home turf.

219
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,240
She's not about to get into
a white van with Jack the lad.

220
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,920
Blitz attack. He jumps out,
clubs her, drags her into the van.

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,696
Yeah, no. There was no screams, no sign
of any altercation. That's not him.

222
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
She trusted him. He knows her, maybe?

223
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,600
- He can't have known all four of them.
- No, he didn't.

224
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,160
But they trusted him.

225
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,560
They trusted him.

226
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,080
I think we're looking for a taxi driver.

What's wrong?

232
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,680
Henry Madsen is talking.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,936
The doctors won't let us
anywhere near him, not yet.

234
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,896
So right now,
anything he might say means nothing.

235
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,520
It's inadmissible. Hearsay.

236
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,920
Guv, what's he saying?

237
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,600
Your name.

238
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,880
Right, okay.

239
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,040
Okay.

240
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,760
Ten minutes ago we got this.

241
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,840
This is the south end of Broughton Row.
It's the closest to our hit.

242
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
- Is that her?
- Yeah, we think that's her.

243
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,536
Tell me we've got
the number plate.

244
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,120
Number plate. Driver's name,
home address, phone number.

245
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
Just triangulating the mobile phone
signal now.

246
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,360
- We've got him locked on.
- Good.

247
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,160
So... Go, go!

248
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,240
Hey, love!

249
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,096
I don't need a cab, thanks.
I don't live that far.

250
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,536
Yeah, no, listen, it's not that, love.

251
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,856
This has just come over the radio.

252
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,840
Some girl's been attacked
just down the road.

253
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,280
- Just past Holywell Avenue.
- Oh, you're joking.

254
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,256
Yeah, apparently he got
away before he could do too much,

255
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,280
but they wanted us to keep an eye out
because he's probably still out there.

256
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,456
I had to stop and tell you, love.
They make us do it.

257
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,600
- Yeah.
- You sure you'll be all right?

258
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,920
- Yeah. It's not far.
- Where do you live?

259
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,320
Um, Lacey Road? Just down that way.

260
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,120
That's past Holywell, isn't it?

261
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,696
I'd hate it if my girl had to
walk home alone, this time of night,

262
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,400
- with all this going on. Hop in.
- I can't. I haven't got any...

263
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
Forget about the money. We'll just
get you home safely, all right?

264
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Come Christmas,
give five quid to the dog's home for me.

265
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,920
- Are you sure?
- Get in.

266
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,160
Come on.

267
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Caught you.

268
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,280
Police, step out the vehicle.

269
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,480
Trevor Rowan, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

270
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,496
You do not have to say anything.

271
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,856
- Not to mention, when questioned...
- I haven't done anything!

272
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,136
Something which you later
rely on in court.

273
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,640
It's all right, love.

274
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,640
Excuse me.

275
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,120
Excuse me, I think
you missed a turn back there,

276
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
that was my street, Lacey Road?

277
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
Excuse me.

278
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,720
Excuse me!

279
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,680
What's wrong?

280
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,240
Just that you said he was impotent.

281
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,200
He is.

282
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,920
Well, he was.

283
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,920
I don't know, it's come back.
The last few weeks, it's come back.

284
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,000
I hate it.

285
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
Do we have to talk about this?

286
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,920
When I'm here, can't I just be here?

287
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
He knows, don't he?

288
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,440
About me and you? He absolutely knows.

289
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,720
Hey, babe, please.

290
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,040

294
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah.

295
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,760
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great!

296
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,800
- Why?
- Oh, no reason, you just seemed...

298
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440

Hello, you're through to Zoe Luther.

311
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Please leave me a message
after the tone and I'll get back...

312
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,040
His alibi sticks.

313
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,800
He was on Eccleston Road, SW1.

314
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
He's not our man.

315
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,960
So there are two taxis
with the same number plate

316
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,160
on the same night in London?

317
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah, no, he just cloned them.
It's easy to do, you know.

318
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,360
So what do we have?

319
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,680
Well, we have this...

320
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,160
He attempts to make a turn
at the end of Broughton Row,

321
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,760
messes up, does a U-turn.

322
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,520
So we checked it out
and it turns out that

323
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,480
Broughton Row used to be a through-way,
but when the hookers moved in,

324
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,960
they locked it off
and made it a rat run.

325
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,000
- This was when?
- March, uh, 2002.

326
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,560
The implication being?

327
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,600
Well, I don't think
he's a real taxi driver.

328
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,200
He tried to be one,
or used to be one but...

329
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,840
Yeah.

330
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
Not only is there no law
against owning second-hand taxis,

331
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,280
it's easy and cheap.

332
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,176
How many people
are running around in these things?

333
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,320
There's no database. But it runs into
the high hundreds, early thousands easy.

334
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
God.

335
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,656
It's more than you want to think about,
let alone track down.

336
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,520
He could have a different licence plate
for every night of the month.

337
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
He's completely anonymous.

338
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,720
One taxi and 20,000 others.

339
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,520
Trusted by default.

340
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,800
He might as well be invisible.

341
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,960
Yeah, and he's on a feeding frenzy.

342
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,440
There'll be another body tomorrow.

343
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,720
And another

344
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,720
and another.

345
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,080
Teller.

346
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,280
Chartwell Hospital's on fire.

347
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,320
Excuse me, sorry.

348
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,400
Sorry, excuse me, thank you.

349
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,400
Uh, Officer?

350
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,520
Fulford.

351
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,800
We're having some trouble with a few
members of the public on Ward 28.

352
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,400
They're refusing to leave the building.

353
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,096
Response is on its way,
but since you're here...

354
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,880
- I'm not supposed to...
- I wouldn't ask

355
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,840
if I didn't think it was an emergency.

356
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,000
I'll wait with the patient.

357
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,760
Ward 28?

358
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,480
Next floor down.

359
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,560
Don't say his name.

360
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,160
Cabbies who've been sacked,
invalided off, retired,

361
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,256
plus a list of drivers who've
tried and failed the Knowledge

362
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,640
over the last 20 years.

363
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,360
Triangulated, cross-reference
with the suspect pool...

364
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,560
Best?

365
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
Left with 23 names.

366
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,920
Sergeant Ripley,
would you mind if I borrowed

367
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,040
the Detective Chief Inspector
for a moment?

368
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,600
Um, no, not at all, sir.

369
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,800
Stressful day?

370
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,840
Oh, five victims dead,
possibly another in 12 hours.

371
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,520
Henry Madsen passed away.

372
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,000
- I'm sorry?
- It could be fluke,

373
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,440
unconnected with the fire.

374
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,000
But the fire was arson

375
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,680
and these two events, co-occurring.

376
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,800
Madsen had a permanent guard.

377
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,680
Who was directed away
from his post by some doctor.

378
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,480
What doctor?

379
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,360
Well, quite young, very pretty.

380
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,040
Dark haired and heterochromatic.

381
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Hetero what? I'm sorry?

382
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,520
Different coloured eyes.
Like David Bowie.

383
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,560
But no doctor with
heterochromia of the eyes

384
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,456
is currently employed
by the Chartwell Hospital...

385
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,040
Well, I don't know. Some doctor lost
a contact lens, perhaps?

386
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,080
Probably.

387
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,600
But if not...
If somebody is impersonating,

388
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,680
posing as a doctor, someone
who wants access to Henry Madsen.

389
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,200
Would you have any notion
of who that might be?

390
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,440
I could think of 100 people
that would want to see him dead.

391
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,360
But I'd start off with
the parents of the victims.

392
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,640
Yes, of course.

393
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,400
But the timing, you see,
the timing, it... It chafes my brain.

394
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,320
Why now?

395
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,240
Why today... The day after he wakes up?

396
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,640
I don't know, Martin, we'll just have to
put that down to a big

397
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,280
mystery.

398
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,320
Well, I can see you're busy.

399
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Hello?

400
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,640
Don't worry about the call being traced.

401
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,680
This is a disposable phone.
One conversation,

402
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I wipe it and it goes into
someone else's garbage.

403
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,480
Listen to me, I think I told you
that I don't want to speak to you.

404
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,120
Not today, not tomorrow. Not ever

405
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
again.

406
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,120
Well, there's a remarkable
absence of gratitude for you.

407
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Do you know what you've done?

408
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,080
Given you back your wife.

409
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Saved your job.

410
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,960
Saved you from
disgrace and imprisonment.

411
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,680
No, you've committed murder.

412
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,680
All I did was finish
the job you started.

413
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,520
What are you going to do, arrest me?

414
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,120
- Yes! I have to!
- Shall I articulate why you won't?

415
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Stop!

416
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,696
You're the one who made me do it.
You've threatened me.

417
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,216
There's phone traffic
between us to prove it,

418
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,696
including the call I'm making
from this phone.

419
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
Empty threats.

420
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,416
You implicate me,
you implicate yourself,

421
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,576
and you're way too
in love with your own genius to do that.

422
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,200
Conspiracy to murder
will just be the start of it.

423
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,160
I can send you to hell.
You'll burn for the rest of your life.

424
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,640
Which is why
I would appreciate some gratitude!

425
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,240
I did it for you! Pig!

426
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,040
Filth! I did it for you!

427
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,560
I want you to stay away!

428
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,480
Do you understand? Stay away from me!
Stay away from my life!

429
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,800
Stay the fuck away! Do you hear me?

430
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,400
What can I do for you, Martin?
Busy day here.

431
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,240
I'd like John Luther's
phone and email records, please.

432
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,560
- Go away.
- I can't.

433
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,096
Whatever it is you're here to tell me,
I don't want to hear it.

434
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,320
So do us a favour,
get yourself an exorcist.

435
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,600
I see.

436
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880
You already know.

437
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,520
- Know what?
- Zoe's been lying to you.

438
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,720
No, no, no. I don't want to hear it.
All right?

439
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,040
I want you out of my way.
I want you out of my life.

440
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,200
Hah, yes,
I've been hearing that a lot today.

441
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,576
I wish I could help you. But I can't.

442
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,520
So I would like you, please,
to stay away.

443
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,040
- You are completely...
- Right.

444
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,080
You all right, boss?

445
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,720
It was the wife. Ex-wife.

446
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Come in.

447
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,720
Um, those suspects...

448
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,120
- Have you eaten?
- What are you, my nan?

449
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,400
Best hit, Graham Shand, drinking in
the same pub as victim number one.

450
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,120
Failed the Knowledge three times,
the last time in 2002.

451
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,640
Until six weeks ago, he worked nights
at a taxi breakdown and recovery garage.

452
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,120
Formerly decent employee.

453
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
Seems to have undergone
some kind of breakdown,

454
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,240
drinking, sexually
inappropriate conduct.

455
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,080
Um, got one. Um, any hard evidence?

456
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,080
No, none. No record of him, his wife,

457
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,216
known friends or family
ever buying a second-hand taxi.

458
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,576
Well, he's had plenty of opportunity

459
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,920
to buy one under the table,
cash in hand, eh?

460
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,280
- Form?
- Uh, none.

461
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,240
I'll get DCI Reed to the house
with a warrant.

462
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,840
- What will we do if he's not there?
- Get him in his weak spot.

463
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,200
- What's that?
- The wife. Always the wife.

464
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,800
Check her out, bring her in.

465
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Nice work.

466
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,840
So what's happening with you and Zoe?

467
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,440
That was her on the phone
just now, right?

468
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,600
- Yes, it was Zoe.
- So are you and she...

469
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,760
No.

470
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,040
Yes. Possibly.

471
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
I don't know.

472
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,320
It's nice to see you're happy for me.

473
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,840
You want to know
the real tragedy about marriage?

474
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,456
- No, thanks.
- Women always think men will change,

475
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,520
but they don't.

476
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,920
Men think women won't change,
but they do.

477
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,040
Where'd you get that from,
a fortune cookie?

478
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,760
I need you to stay in this building
until you're cleared to leave.

479
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,520
I'm trying to run an investigation here.

480
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,360
Yeah, and like you say, this is
the best place to run it from, so...

481
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,120
Just do that.

482
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,160
No one.

483
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,320
No one's home.

484
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,880
Yeah, bye.

485
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,360
All right? We're shut.

486
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,000
- Uh, Linda Shand?
- Yeah?

487
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,696
Uh, Mrs Shand,
I'm Detective Sergeant Ripley.

488
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,080
Hang on. Hang on. Who, sorry?

489
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,720
Detective Sergeant Ripley
of the Serious Crime Unit, Hobb Lane.

490
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,056
I wonder if you wouldn't mind
coming with me,

491
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,400
help clear up a few things.

492
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,560
Uh, what sort of thing?

493
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,680
Probably it's nothing, we just need you
to answer a few questions.

494
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,160
About what?

495
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,520
Graham, mostly.

496
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,720
Oh, my God.

497
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,920
What's he done... Has he done something?

498
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,520
If you'd like to come with me?

499
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,680
Oh, I feel sick. Can I just?

500
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Yeah, course.

501
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,280
- Linda?
- What's going on?

502
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,120
- What do you mean?
- The police are here.

503
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,920
- What do they want?
- I don't know!

504
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,560
- Well, did they mention me?
- What did you do?

505
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,280
- What did they say?
- Have you been stealing again?

506
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,200
No, of course I haven't! No!

507
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,280
Then what have you done, Graham?

508
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,480
Well, what did they say? They must have
said something. What did they say?

509
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,000
Give me the phone, give me the phone!

510
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,840
God!

511
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,960
We don't have any other room,
so I have to use the interview room.

512
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,840
Can I get you a drink or anything?

513
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,280
- Uh, yes, some water.
- You want some water? Okay.

514
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

515
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,240
So how are things
with you and your husband?

516
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,040
Fine. Why?

517
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,600
Do you know where he was Friday night?

518
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,160
Yeah, at the pub.
With me and some friends.

519
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,360
It was my birthday.

520
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,760
Was he with you all night?

521
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,960
Not all night, no.
‘Cause he... He went to work.

522
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,920
Work where?

523
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,760
He works at an
all-night recovery garage.

524
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,400
The thing is, Linda, Graham hasn't
worked there for two months now.

525
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,480
You didn't know?

526
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,480
Boss? I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's a bit urgent.

527
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,600
- Right now?
- I'm afraid it can't wait, sir, sorry.

528
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,240
Linda, if you'll excuse me, uh...
I've got to dash.

529
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,256
Come back and we'll finish talking,
all right?

530
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,800
Sorry, talk about what, I...

531
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,920
Soon as I get back,
we'll talk, all right? Sorry.

532
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,520
- I time that all right?
- Perfect.

533
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
How is she?

534
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,880
Well, she knows something's not right.

535
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,960
No.

536
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,560
You don't think this approach
is a bit merciless?

537
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
No.

538
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,000
Graham knows we're on to him, all right?

539
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,440
And he'll try and kill as many as he can
before we catch him.

540
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,640
If I have to terrify his wife
to stop that happening,

541
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,960
I can live with that.

542
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,680
Thus spake John Luther,
gentleman of the parish.

543
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,120
She knows what her husband is.

544
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,400
Yeah, but maybe not
what he's done.

545
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
There is a difference.

546
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,000
There's...

547
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,800
No, no...

548
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,080
No, no, what is this?

549
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,240
What's this? What is that?

550
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,520
What is that?

551
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,240
What... What...

552
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,000
- Linda?
- No, get it off me!

553
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,160
What is that? What is that?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No, no, no!

554
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,120
No, no, my God, no, no...

555
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Oh, God!

556
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,480
No! Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

557
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,960
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What did he do? What did he do? Oh, God!

558
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,360
It's all right.

559
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,680
- Is there a glass for me?
- Of course.

560
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,560
Okay.

561
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,840
I have something I need...
I need to say to, um...

562
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,640
To tell you.

563
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,360
You already know.

564
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,080
Yeah, pretty much.

565
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
How?

566
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Well, it hardly takes
an intuitive genius, does it?

567
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,840
Well, why didn't you say something?

568
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,760
Perhaps it's none of my business.

569
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,240
Of course it's your business!
Don't say that.

570
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,800
Please...

571
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,760
It's absolutely your business!

572
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,880
Look, um...

573
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,760
- You know, for what it's worth...
- Oh, Mark!

574
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,120
No, seriously, this is what
I think you should do,

575
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,880
you should make a list
of the reasons why you married him.

576
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,400
And then make another list of
the reasons why you left him.

577
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,440
And then see if
the two lists don't overlap.

578
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,280
I'm so sorry.

579
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,720
He's not what I want. He's just not.

580
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,920
Well, what do you want?

581
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,040
This.

582
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,560
Here.

583
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,640
Right now, with you.

584
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,880
- You all right?
- I can't...

585
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,240
Uh, I know, I know.

586
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,080
- It's all right, okay?
- What's he done?

587
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,960
Hey, Linda, do you mind
if we keep talking?

588
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,880
Yeah?

589
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,200
Linda, how long
have you been married?

590
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,400
Uh...

591
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,440
Um... 20 years.

592
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,120
He said if I ever left him,
he'd kill himself.

593
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,640
And, um, I tried, once.

594
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,360
I, um, packed my bags
and bought a ticket to Cardiff.

595
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,920
And he slashed his wrists in the bath

596
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
and he called me
before he called the ambulance.

597
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,680
He didn't even do it properly.

598
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,360
He just sliced at his wrists.

599
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,280
There was lots of blood, lots of drama,
but no real risk to Graham.

600
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,680
Which is the story of his life.

601
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm going to ask you some really

602
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,760
difficult

603
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,440
and personal questions. My intention
is not to embarrass you, okay?

604
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,440
Is it about the handbags?

605
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,240
Yes.

606
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,520
Yeah, why don't you tell me
about the handbags?

607
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,720
Early on, oh, we must have been married,
what, a year, 18 months...

608
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,960
He used to nick them.

609
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,520
And, uh, and I confronted him and he...

610
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,040
He cried and, uh, he made up some story.

611
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,560
You reported him?

612
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,640
- No.
- Why?

613
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,960
‘Cause he's my husband.

614
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,240
What did you think he was doing
with the hand bags?

615
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,920
He used to, um,

616
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,680
sniff them and, uh,

617
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,240
touch himself.

618
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,120
I was embarrassed.

619
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,000
And a bit of me thought it was...

620
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,040
A bit of me was scared it was me.

621
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,320
That I was doing something wrong
and that, uh,

622
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,320
somehow, you know, people
would find out and... And they'd laugh.

623
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Look, Linda, I have to tell you, Graham
is involved in a very serious crime.

624
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,560
And these urges,
these urges that he's had,

625
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,040
he's controlled them for a while.

626
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,240
Until suddenly,

627
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,720
this.

628
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,240
He's been murdering young women.

629
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,520
It's not my fault.

630
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,080
What, what's not your fault?

631
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,280
What do you mean by that?

632
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,240
Linda? Hey, hey, look at me.

633
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,360
What's not your fault?

634
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,440
I forgot to erase a text message.

635
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,680
He checks my phone
when I'm in the shower.

636
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,160
He goes down my handbag.

637
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,600
He checks your phone and

638
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,600
found out you were
sleeping with someone?

639
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,000
Who is he, Linda?

640
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,760
It's not my fault.

641
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,880
You need to tell me his name.

642
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,960
Right, here it is, Dennis Keaton,
23 Black Swan Way.

643
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,680
Call him, tell him to keep himself safe.

644
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Graham is punishing her
for being unfaithful.

645
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,376
He's working his way
towards killing her.

646
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,776
Can't do it now, 'cause we've got her,

647
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,096
so he's gonna go for
the next best thing.

648
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,120
Gray?

649
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,040
Straight to answerphone. Guv?

650
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,360
Uh, what was the last number
called from his house?

651
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,520
The last number from a Dennis Keaton
is City Chic Escorts.

652
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,200
Oh, no, no, has he done it before?

653
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,440
No.

654
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,080
Dennis Keaton is dead.

655
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Get me the number
of the hooker that's going there,

656
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,760
put them on speaker for me.

657
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,800
- Oh, hang on a sec.
- What?

658
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,880
Text message from a Layla.

659
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,320
- "Safe arrival, 23 Black Swan Way."
- Oh, no.

660
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,960
Let me see if I can get Reed
on the speaker.

661
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,960
Come on, Layla, pick up the phone.

662
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,880
I'm almost there.
Two, three minutes max.

663
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,480
She's already there.
She's an escort, her name's Layla.

664
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,840
Can't kick the door down.
He'll kill her.

665
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,640
What do you suggest?

666
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,600
I got to be there, boss.

667
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,040
- Come on, I've got to go!
- No.

668
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,600
How quickly can you get there?

669
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,896
Just tell me what to do and it's done.

670
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,440
Ian, I'm going to send Ripley.

671
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,760
Take Linda.

672
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,720
We'll go for that weak spot.

673
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,400
Dennis, is it?

674
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
Absolutely.

675
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,880
It's lovely to meet you, Dennis.

676
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm Layla.

677
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,840
- May I?
- Yeah.

678
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,480
Well?

679
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,360
Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,120
- So, do we, uh?
- Absolutely.

681
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,080
You're the boss.

682
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,760
But first...

683
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,520
Oh, right, yeah, um...

684
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,280
- 225.
- You're very kind.

685
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,840
So, would you like to show me
where you want me?

686
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,360
Upstairs, if that's okay?

687
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,360
That's absolutely fine.

688
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,760
Dennis, it's my girlfriend.

689
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,800
She likes to check up on me during
dates, to make sure I arrive safely.

690
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,640
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not. Go ahead.

691
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
Hello, darling.

692
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,600
Layla, this is Chief Inspector
John Luther.

693
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,216
I need you to
listen to me very carefully.

694
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,320
Keep smiling and act
like this is the agency calling you.

695
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,640
Yeah, yeah, I got here quite safely.

696
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,840
Right, excellent. Okay, can you
get out of the house safely?

697
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,640
Not really, not right now, love.

698
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,120
Listen to me.
I need you to get to a safe place

699
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,040
and just wait for us. We're on our way.

700
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,120
I will. Stop worrying, silly.

701
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,120
Honestly.

702
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,280
Anyway.

703
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,600
Second door on the right.

704
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,440
Can I take your bag?

705
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,120
Of course.

706
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,160
- Can 1...
- What?

707
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,600
Bathroom.

708
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,760
I'd rather you didn't.

709
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,640
Let me in! Come on!
Listen, love. Let me in! Let me in!

710
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,200
Come on! Come on!

711
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,320
Let me in! Let me in, let me in!

712
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,480
- You've got to help me.
- Listen, we're close. Hold on.

713
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,360
Please! Please, come now,
I need you, please!

714
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,640
- Layla, Layla...
- Justin, where are you?

715
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,480
Help me!

716
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,656
I just want to touch you!

717
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,280
I just want to kiss you.

718
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,480
Do you know what I'm going to do to you?

719
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,840
Graham?

720
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,720
Gray? Are you here?

721
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,320
Graham, are you here?

722
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,960
See?

723
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,160
Look at you.

724
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,400
You sad little prick!

725
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,560
Put the hammer down, Graham.

726
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,040
You're all done.

727
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,920
Now, just put it down, all right?

728
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,040
I'm tired, I want to go home.

729
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,640
Ah! Ah!

730
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,000
Graham Shand, I am arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

731
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,736
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

732
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,256
if you fail to mention when questioned

733
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,520
something which you
later rely on in court.

734
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,760
Sorry. Excuse me.

735
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,080
20?

736
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,640
Um,

737
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,480
look, I know it's late.

738
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,080
I, uh... I've just called you 100 times.

739
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,200
I know it's difficult.

740
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,960
I just want to hear your voice.

741
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,640
It's just been a way
of saying goodbye properly.

742
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,200
There is love in the world.

743
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,320
Are you sure you're all right?

744
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,440
It's not my fault! It's not my fault.

745
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,840
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

746
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,120
All I need you to do is
give me those diamonds.

747
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,200
I don't have them.

748
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:42,224
