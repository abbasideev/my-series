1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,440
You like that one, don't you.

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,600
Ms Ross? Er, Kirsten Ross?

3
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,760
Yes?

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm Detective Inspector
Phillip Hamilton...

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,520
My God, is Carl all right?

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Is Carl okay?

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,520
Perhaps if I...

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,480
Of course. I'm sorry. Please...

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,240
Before I go on, I might ask
if there's anyone else at home?

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,240
Anyone who might, um, be able to help?

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,320
No. No. I'm waiting for...
Oh, God, is he all right?

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,920
Your husband will be home soon.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,320
Either he opens the door
to find his wife

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
and baby spread all over the carpet,

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,520
or he comes home to find the baby
safely asleep in its cot,

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,720
but his wife gone.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
So Kirsten...

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,480
Which is it to be?

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,920
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,600
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,640
♪ Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,040
♪ She will love you like a fly

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
♪ Will never love you again ♪

24
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
Why all the secrecy?

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,920
I want your unadulterated impressions.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Unadulterated by what?

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,640
Rumours. Just go in.

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
It's blood.

29
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
The victim?

30
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,800
Kirsten Ross. Thirty-two.
Missing, presumed abducted.

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,440
- She's got a young child?
- Leo Ross, yeah, three months old.

32
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,040
Is the baby all right?

33
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,720
Untouched. Father comes home,
sees all this, imagines the worst.

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,640
What, you think he did this? The father?

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
No, I'm not thinking that.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,120
"Do not fear the abyss,
for I am the abyss

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,760
"and thou shalt weep with the
fervour and bliss of my love."

38
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,080
Blimey. Satanism?

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,560
Are you superstitious
about that sort of thing?

40
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,560
Not so much, no. Not as a rule.

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,760
But this is pretty weird.

42
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,400
The writing?

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,880
- Same hand. Same writer.
- What hand? What writer?

44
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,560
Ten years ago Grace Allen
was abducted from her home.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Her baby was asleep upstairs.
Unhurt. No sign of struggle.

46
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,400
Her husband comes home,
finds his hallway looking like this.

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,960
Same writing. Same words.

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,200
Three months later, the investigation
received an anonymous tip,

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,160
some bloke who claims to be
an accomplice of this man...

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,800
Lucien Burgess. Burgess is a rich kid.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
But he's born with bad blood.

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,440
Aged 30, he's got his own
little black magic cult

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,400
derived on the writings
of Aleister Crowley.

54
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,720
Who called himself "The Great Beast".

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,760
- The blood on the walls?
- Human and fresh.

56
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,400
Tapped from a living source.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,680
Human body's got six litres of it.

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,800
Tap a little bit at a time,
over a few weeks,

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
you've got a whole body's worth of blood
to splash around.

60
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,640
- But no corpse.
- And the handwriting?

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,440
Burgess favours the right.

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Whoever wrote on the walls
favours the left.

63
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,976
They were confident they had their man,
but they had nothing on him.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
So an undercover operation
was authorised.

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
It went wrong.
While he was supposed to be undercover

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,960
DS Richard Henley attempted
to make an arrest.

67
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,320
He did this...

68
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,560
All but killed him. Henley does
three and a half years for GBH.

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,280
Burgess gets rich
on government compensation.

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,440
Then sells his story to the tabloids,
richer still.

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,040
Publishes a memoir, richer still.

72
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
A year after all this,

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
Grace Allen's body turns up
right next to a railway siding.

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
She'd been frozen post-mortem.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,320
When they found her,
she'd been completely exsanguinated.

76
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,360
Burgess had drained her blood.

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,680
Forensics confirm.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,280
The writing on the wall tonight
was in Grace Allen's blood.

79
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,840
- Still fresh, ten years later.
- That must be enough to pick him up?

80
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Well, yeah. Ordinarily.

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,936
But the last time the police
went after him,

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,640
we caused a full-blown media
and political shit-storm.

83
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,640
Kirsten Ross is probably still alive
and out there right now.

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
Finding her is our highest priority,

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
but not our sole priority.

86
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,600
It's imperative
we stay clear of Burgess.

87
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,280
We don't so much as cast
a glance in his direction

88
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,920
until we've got something bulletproof.

89
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,160
Let me go.
Please let me out.

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,360
I need to see my baby.

91
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,920
- Are you Mark North?
- Yeah?

92
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
Hi!

93
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,680
Oh, my God... What happened?

94
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,120
- They were waiting for me.
- Who?

95
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,520
- Whoever did this.
- What do you mean?

96
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,520
He sent girls.

97
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,160
He sent girls to do it.
That man is a genius.

98
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,600
- He wouldn't.
- You think?

99
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,920
Let me have a look.

100
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,880
Let me have a look.

101
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
According to the literature,
if the Left-Handed Man actually existed,

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,400
he'd be an acolyte, follower,
a submissive personality.

103
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,560
What? An apostle that betrays
his master to the police

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,120
and then still works with him,
ten years later?

105
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
That doesn't sound right to me.

106
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,480
So what... What are we saying then?

107
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,920
Well, Burgess wants fame, doesn't he?
He wants infamy.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,080
He wants to humiliate the police.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
We had his handwriting analysed.

110
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,056
Tried to make him
write with his left hand

111
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,320
and he couldn't do it.

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
Yeah, but it's still not right,
though, is it?

113
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,200
Grace Allen's ten-year-old blood
shows up

114
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,200
at Kirsten Ross's house tonight.

115
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,640
And the blood on the walls
at Grace Allen's house was human too.

116
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,320
- The source was never identified.
- Never.

117
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
Maybe they weren't
looking in the right place.

118
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,440
You know, maybe they were thinking
it was as fresh as it looked.

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,880
So it could have come from another
victim, an even earlier victim?

120
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,200
Yeah, maybe a lot earlier.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Do me a favour. Dig around cold cases
unsolved with similar indications.

122
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,560
John. DCI Luther's phone, DS Ripley.

123
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,680
Oh, brilliant, yeah. Cheers.

124
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,280
- Boss. Boss.
- Yeah?

125
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,480
I lost you for a minute there.

126
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,800
- Yes, sorry I do that. What?
- Your undercover guy's here.

127
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, God. He looks like shit.

128
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,160
DCI John Luther, Richard Henley.

129
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
I really appreciate you coming in.

130
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,320
Well, they didn't give me much choice.

131
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,520
Why don't you, er,
use the interview room?

132
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Yeah.

133
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,280
Benny... Sorry about the hour, mate.
I need a favour, can you get over here?

134
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
Oh, Alice.

135
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,480
So I'm returning home, I'm parking,
same place, same time as usual.

136
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,280
And they walk from up the street,
but it's the...

137
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,600
It's the stiff arm by the side,
you know,

138
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,440
what is that about, why do they do that?

139
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,120
"They"? Who exactly are "they"?

140
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
These, these hoodies, these kids.
These girls.

141
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,760
- Girls?
- Girls. And so, I'm surrounded.

142
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,440
And one of them says,
"Are you Mark North?"

143
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,880
I say, "Yeah". Bang, I'm on the floor
having the shit kicked out of me.

144
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,840
And then the same girl

145
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,600
says, "John says hello".

146
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
"John says hello"?

147
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Word for word.

148
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,640
Please.

149
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,600
The truth is, Richard, we're nowhere.

150
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,800
All right, we've got SOCOS at the house,
bodies on the street.

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,560
He won't have left you anything.

152
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,960
Not at all.

153
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,520
And the clock is
ticking on Kirsten Ross.

154
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,320
- I'm not a copper any more.
- Yes, you are.

155
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,200
There was a...

156
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,000
A lot of sex stuff.

157
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Did he use blood? In your presence?

158
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,480
He said all bodily fluids were powerful.

159
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,880
Semen, vaginal secretions, blood.
Menstrual blood was best.

160
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,120
I mean what did he do with it?

161
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,600
Well, all that stuff had to be
taken into the body. In various ways.

162
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
And you had to...

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,800
I let him do anything he wanted.

164
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,840
Richard,

165
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,560
whatever happened, whatever you

166
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,480
allowed to happen to you,

167
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
all right, you did something valiant.

168
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,720
And every copper in this shop
knows that.

169
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,680
It didn't help though, did it?

170
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,560
How did you end up beating him?

171
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,880
I'd been undercover for 15 months.

172
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Thought I'd won his trust.

173
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,960
This one night, we're at his flat

174
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,000
and he gives me a glass of wine.

175
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,520
I drink it,

176
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,960
wake up tied to a chair.

177
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,160
It turns out, he'd known
I was police from day one.

178
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,920
He showed me a picture of Grace Allen.
She was alive.

179
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,840
And in the picture right next
to her face, that day's paper.

180
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,240
And he said,

181
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,520
"This is the closest you'll ever come."

182
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,080
And he set light to the picture
and burnt it right in front of me.

183
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,680
Then he cut me loose.

184
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,240
And that's when you did that?

185
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

186
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,560
That's what I did.

187
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
You are radiant.

188
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Shh.

189
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,880
Are you ready?

190
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,360
Who's that in there?

191
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,960
Oh, that's, er, Richard Henley.

192
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,640
- Ex-copper Richard Henley?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
Well, Officer Lieutenant.

194
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,320
- Who's in there with the duchess?
- Erm...

195
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,160
Oh, that's Mark North.

196
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,280
- Right.
- Mmm.

197
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,040
- Busy night, eh?
- I'll say.

198
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
She was naked,

199
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,280
and, er,

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,960
in some kind of box,

201
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,800
er, rectangular, not coffin-shaped.

202
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,360
It was, er, shorter, deeper.

203
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,920
She was tied at the wrists
and ankles with a...

204
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,760
I don't know.
It was too dark to see properly.

205
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,720
Er, her eyes were

206
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,080
like a horse's eyes,
when it's terrified.

207
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,680
How could you, um,

208
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,960
how could you read the paper?

209
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,080
- Sorry?
- You said the box, it was too dark

210
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,760
to see details of the straps.

211
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,280
But you read the headline,
you could see her eyes, how?

212
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,760
There was a light across her face.

213
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,280
- A reflection of the flash or something.
- A light?

214
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,760
Like a crescent of light.

215
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,280
It was her eyes that did it.

216
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,600
I wanted to kill him.

217
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,200
I knew it would cost me.
But I didn't care.

218
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,720
And to this day,

219
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,280
the biggest regret of my life
is not killing the...

220
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,880
Any idea

221
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,720
what it's like to feel like that?

222
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,240
Yes, I do.

223
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,600
I know exactly what that feels like.

224
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,080
Leave me alone, leave me alone...

225
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,320
Three guesses why Zoe's
gentleman caller was here?

226
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,760
To confess he's a dick?

227
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,760
He's been assaulted.

228
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,360
- Good.
- He blames you.

229
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Oh, come on.

230
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,600
You've already come close
to one suspension for assaulting him.

231
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,520
So I'm pretty much obliged
to take this seriously.

232
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,320
The man is a fantasist.

233
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,400
The marks on his face aren't fantasies.

234
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,520
Guy, all due respect, Kirsten Ross is
out there alive right now.

235
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,440
And you bother me with this?

236
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Seriously?

237
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
Okay.

238
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,400
I'll take my time
entering the paperwork.

239
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
But I will be entering it,
first thing tomorrow.

240
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,800
Unless Mark North withdraws
his complaint before then.

241
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,120
If he does,
no-one need know this ever happened.

242
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,120
Thank you.

243
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Yeah, so go! Sod off! Speak to him.

244
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,840
Be nice. Beg, if you have to.

245
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,336
I ran the blood
from the Grace Allen cold case

246
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
through every available database.

247
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,560
We got a match.
Precious Akingbade was found

248
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
on the banks of a canal in Birmingham.

249
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Exsanguinated and genitally mutilated.

250
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
I remember this. This was years ago.

251
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,080
Yeah, 20 years ago. 1990.

252
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,560
Two different murders,
completely different MOs.

253
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,880
Separated by a decade
and half a country.

254
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,000
You know, Burgess must've been

255
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,160
20 years old when he done this?

256
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,720
Benny, I appreciate you coming in.

257
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,736
That's okay.
I was just immersed in the world of, er,

258
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,240
King Crimson and the World of Warcraft.

259
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,040
Er, as much as I love you,
I can't pretend to know what that is.

260
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,600
What I'm trying to say is,

261
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,120
do I smell like someone
who's been smoking marijuana?

262
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,200
A little bit.

263
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,040
D'you think anybody's going to notice?

264
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,880
See if you can ID these girls.

265
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,120
Quietly as you can.

266
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,480
You okay?

267
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,240
I will be,
once you tell me who they are.

268
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,720
Give me an hour or two. Or three.

269
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,680
Boss?

270
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,320
Burgess runs a little occult bookshop.
They sell on-line.

271
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,416
Do you think Burgess
will be at work today?

272
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
He's got to make it
look like a normal day.

273
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,680
Pay him a little visit.

274
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,960
John. You come here today? Seriously?

275
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
Mark?

276
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Mark.

277
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,840
Oh, dear.

278
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,400
Mark, I had nothing to do with this.

279
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,880
What you did, John,
I understand it, all right?

280
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,440
It so, in a brutal way,
just kind of sums you up, I suppose.

281
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,240
- But look at my face. Look.
- All right...

282
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
If you do this, all right,

283
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,320
there's an innocent woman
out there is gonna get hurt.

284
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,200
It's got nothing to do with this,
you, me, or the rest of it.

285
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,680
John, you cannot keep
saying to Zoe that you love her,

286
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,880
and then putting her through this.

287
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,040
You have to stop.
Stop for her, stop for you. Stop.

288
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,200
Listen to me, Mark.
I'm asking you as nicely as I can.

289
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,640
Don't do this to me.

290
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,040
And what exactly are you saying?
If you're going to threaten me,

291
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,176
why don't you make a proper job of it?

292
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,400
Say it out loud,
so we all know where we stand.

293
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,240
Zoe.

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,120
There were lots of things
I wish I had told you,

295
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
things that I did that I was ashamed of,

296
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,800
afraid of.

297
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,360
I didn't talk to you,
but at least I didn't lie.

298
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,320
Okay? Like I am not lying now.
Mark, I didn't do this to you.

299
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,640
I really need you to trust me on this.

300
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Alice, what are you playing at?

301
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,600
I thought you wanted Zoe back.

302
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
And you do it by getting
me blamed for beating up Mark North?

303
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,400
Getting me fired?
I'm in serious trouble,

304
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,600
more trouble than you think!

305
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,800
You won't lose your job.

306
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,320
- Or your wife.
- Alice, do me a favour.

307
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,320
Stop interfering!

308
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,200
All right, please, no more helping.
Can you do that?

309
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
John?

310
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,560
Yeah. How'd you know that?

311
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
We do most of our trade on-line

312
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,920
or by appointment.

313
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,680
So...

314
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,720
I'm all yours.

315
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,960
What's your pleasure?

316
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,040
Five hundred quid

317
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,960
for a poem hand illustrated
by the Yorkshire Ripper.

318
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,600
Seven hundred and fifty quid
for a letter

319
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,960
from the Ripper to
a female correspondent. Wow.

320
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,360
Well, that includes
a small self-portrait.

321
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,680
Sutcliffe snuggling up to a woman.

322
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
Large breasted.

323
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Hmm.

324
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,200
But you know there's
nothing new under the sun.

325
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,760
There used to be quite a trade

326
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,880
in handkerchiefs dipped
in the blood of hanged men.

327
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Hair clippings, snuff boxes,
garters, cravat pins.

328
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,560
Who would buy them?

329
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,560
Young women, mostly.

330
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,840
Wow, young women?

331
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Even stuff like this?

332
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,760
Peter Kurten,

333
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,960
the Vampire of Dusseldorf.

334
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,480
Richard Trenton Chase, the Vampire of
Sacramento. Women buy this stuff?

335
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,640
It's a kink. A sex thing.

336
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,080
Many, many women fantasise
about being tied up, strangled,

337
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,480
raped, eaten.

338
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,240
You think so?

339
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,600
Oh, yeah.

340
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,240
The more depraved the killer,
the more women fawn on him.

341
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,280
It's called hybristophilia.

342
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
Sexual arousal
from thoughts of violence.

343
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,680
It's his willingness to murder
that attracts her.

344
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,560
His murder becomes hers.

345
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,720
Hmm.

346
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,720
- Well, I have a confession.
- Really?

347
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,280
Yeah.

348
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,560
- My autobiography. You're a fan?
- You got me.

349
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,360
Course you know, if I sign this,
its resale value increases hugely.

350
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,080
I'll be putting money in your pocket.

351
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
- I know.
- You're a dealer?

352
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,200
Collector. And I'm paying.

353
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,960
Well, it's two hundred and fifty.

354
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,480
- You serious?
- Oh, yes.

355
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,880
I've quite the following.

356
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,960
Well, you've got yourself a deal.

357
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,560
There you go.

358
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,440
Good catch.

359
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,640
There you are.

360
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,800
- Sacrificial Lamb.
- Yeah.

361
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,760
Yeah, well...

362
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:17,784
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

363
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,680
I learnt with terrible horror
this morning

364
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
of the disappearance of Kirsten Ross.

365
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
My heart goes out to her
and to her family,

366
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,560
especially her husband
and her little daughter.

367
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Having already received a visit
this morning from a man who I believe

368
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,520
to have been a police officer,

369
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,240
I've called this press conference
in anticipation of my arrest.

370
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,880
I want to say publicly,

371
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,480
while I'm still able, that I had
nothing to do with this crime,

372
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,040
nor the crime...

373
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,200
Nor the crime against poor Grace Allen.

374
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,000
I pray that this time, the Police
Service can see past its own prejudice

375
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,280
and its own desire to seek
a sacrificial lamb.

376
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,160
- Thank you.
- Mr Burgess will now take questions.

377
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,640
Burgess has taken absolute control
of this investigation.

378
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
We can't go near him.

379
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,960
He can't let Kirsten Ross live now.

380
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,920
Well, not for too long,
I mean, he can't afford to.

381
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,920
Now that he knows we're
on his back like this.

382
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
The order was stay away from him!

383
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,000
Boss, he prepared the whole thing,

384
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,320
the abduction,
the press conference, everything.

385
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,080
So Kirsten Ross dies a lonely death

386
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,160
while the media ensure
we can't go near our only suspect?

387
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,360
Right, I submitted
Mark North's statement this morning.

388
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,160
Oh, God. Don't take me off this.

389
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,600
Not because of him.
I can find Kirsten. I can find her!

390
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,640
I fought your corner and I fought it
hard, nobody wants you off this.

391
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,520
- All right. But what?
- But...

392
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,600
There are caveats.

393
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,640
What caveats?

394
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,560
Mr Schenk.

395
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,360
Martin Schenk.

396
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,680
Complaints.

397
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,040
I know this isn't a good day,
so all I ask is five minutes.

398
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,280
You and I sit down,
have a chat, put this silliness to bed.

399
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,960
Absolutely. It's just that
I have an abduction on at the moment

400
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,840
and time's running out for my victim.

401
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,760
Do you mind if I just brief
Sergeant Ripley about something?

402
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,600
Absolutely.

403
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Keep the train moving.

404
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,800
That man is about to suspend me.

405
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,080
He can't do that, can he?

406
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,200
Can, has to and will.
So we got to work real quick.

407
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,520
Still nothing solid. No forensics,
eyewitnesses, CCTV. Nothing.

408
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,960
So revisit the cold cases.
What did Burgess leave behind?

409
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,200
- Nothing. The man's a ghost.
- We know that about him.

410
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,296
All we're looking for is where
he kept Precious and Grace

411
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,120
between abduction
and dumping the bodies.

412
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Hmm.

413
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,080
Precious Akingbade lived
and died in Birmingham.

414
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,856
I can't see anything that
links Burgess to the Midlands.

415
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,800
No, forget the distance between them.

416
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,600
What do the dumpsites have in common?

417
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,080
Precious Akingbade was
dumped by the side of a canal.

418
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,760
Yeah, and Grace Allen was dumped here.
Easy access to the roadway.

419
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,160
But less than a hundred metres
from a waterway.

420
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,720
Henley said there was
a crescent of light

421
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,560
across the Grace Allen picture.

422
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,000
Bright enough to read the headlines.
A reflection, a flash.

423
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,000
So that's what he said it looked like.
What if it wasn't that?

424
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,040
What if it was daylight
coming in through a round window?

425
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,960
He's got a boat.

426
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,280
I've got to get out of here. Cover me.

427
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,760
I was waiting for DCI Luther.

428
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,480
Um, last time I saw him, sir,
he was headed that way.

429
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,080
Which way?

430
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,640
- That way?
- Er, absolutely, yeah.

431
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,560
So what do you want?

432
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,400
I need you to help me catch someone.

433
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,080
I was under the impression
you wanted me to stop helping.

434
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,280
Don't push it.

435
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,080
How do I know you're not
playing a double game?

436
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,320
One stone, multiple birds.

437
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,680
Trying to make me speak carelessly
in order to entrap me.

438
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,320
That would be illegal.
Plus I really need to catch this man.

439
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,280
More than you want to catch me?

440
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,840
At the moment, yeah.

441
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm running out of time.

442
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,000
Because if I thought you were
about to lose interest in me...

443
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
I'd be inconsolable.

444
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,640
I just need a way in,

445
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,240
to know what it's like to be him.

446
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,360
To not feel anything.

447
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,240
I feel things.

448
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,200
- Not mercy.
- Not sentiment.

449
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,240
I can't empathise
with this man's state of being

450
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,680
any more than you can.

451
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,960
Because,
disregarding a single, alleged act,

452
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,760
carried out for different
alleged reasons,

453
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,440
he and I might just as well be
from different species.

454
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,440
See, I disagree.

455
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,320
- Murder's murder.
- But it isn't, is it?

456
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,160
Not even to you.

457
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,200
This man Burgess,

458
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,840
he's just a naughty child showing off.

459
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,040
You already know his flaw,

460
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,680
his compulsion to dominate,
to be in control.

461
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,640
And you already know

462
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,800
how to exploit that.

463
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,880
- How?
- Oh, come on.

464
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,240
Change the state of play.

465
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Yeah, well, I tried that with you...

466
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,120
and it failed.

467
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,560
Only just.

468
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
Ripley.

469
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,280
Um, will do. Okay. Yeah. Right away.

470
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,440
Um, DCI Luther's waiting for me outside.

471
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,560
I'm very much obliged to you,
Detective Sergeant Ripley.

472
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
No problem, sir.

473
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,280
- Go on.
- So I went through

474
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,160
every record of stolen boats
from 1988 to 1991.

475
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,560
- And?
- First, there's way many.

476
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,160
Turns out boats get stolen a lot.

477
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,696
So I'm thinking,
he needs a vessel that can

478
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,080
navigate canals in Birmingham.
That cuts the list.

479
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,080
All these were reported stolen in '89,
just before the last recession,

480
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,720
when there were lots of bogus insurance
claims. Six stolen boats, six owners.

481
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,256
I cross-referenced the names
against Burgess's known history.

482
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,360
What'd you find?

483
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,480
Louis Gallant. Claimed for a stolen
narrowboat, the Julia, in July 1989.

484
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,400
Suspected fraudulent claim,
never proven.

485
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,200
- Connection to Burgess?
- Friends at Cambridge.

486
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,360
Burgess and Gallant
were arrested together

487
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,200
on a charge of possession
with intent to supply crack cocaine.

488
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,280
That's a pretty big charge
for two middle-class white boys in '89.

489
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,280
Burgess takes the rap for it,
does a bit of time, Gallant walks.

490
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,680
So he was in debt to Burgess.

491
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,960
All we got to do is...

492
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,080
Already done it. Louis Gallant is
a family man with a serious job,

493
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,656
he's looking more credit crunched
by the hour and mortgaged up the wazoo.

494
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,240
I got everything for a promise
not to drag him through court.

495
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,880
- So he sold the boat to Burgess?
- No, he gave it to him.

496
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,776
Even helped him forge
a new registration number,

497
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,280
which is easily done, apparently.

498
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,920
So Burgess renames the boat the Isis.

499
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,696
I've got a copy of the agreement
for berth, housing boat certificate,

500
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,000
British Waterways Certificate,
Council Tax, insurance,

501
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,280
Boat Safety Certificate. They all show
he's moored at St Katharine's Dock.

502
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,040
Now the bad news.

503
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,920
All these documents are in the name
of this guy, Brian Summers.

504
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,880
Oh, bollocks!

505
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,360
So what are you saying? Burgess used
a proxy to get the licenses?

506
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,960
A friend, out of work actor, junkie,
con-artist from prison, who knows?

507
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,120
I tell you what,
if we want to search this boat,

508
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,960
we have to make it part
of the investigation.

509
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,240
The only way to do that is to prove
that Brian Summers didn't exist.

510
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,880
We could spend weeks of due diligence,
just chasing our tails around.

511
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,920
Insufficient evidence,
search warrant denied.

512
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,696
We go upstairs with that,
they'll say, "Go away,

513
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,200
"you haven't done enough,
do your homework".

514
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,120
Kirsten Ross dies, Burgess
dumps the body and walks. Again.

515
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,560
- All right, so what do we do?
- Forget the rule book.

516
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,240
Change the state of play.

517
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,440
All right?

518
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,040
Kirsten? Kirsten Ross?
If you can hear me,

519
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,440
I'm John Luther, I'm a police officer.

520
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,120
We're here to get you
back to your family.

521
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,840
Oi!

522
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,480
Don't.

523
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,600
Don't what?

524
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,120
Just don't.

525
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,400
What are you saying?

526
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,520
We weren't here.

527
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,560
That isn't what we said.

528
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,880
We said if she was here,
we'd call it in.

529
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,360
Claim exigent circumstances.

530
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,960
If she was alive!

531
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,840
She's not alive, is she?

532
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,120
Boss, this is a crime scene.

533
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,320
A murder scene.

534
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,016
You don't walk away from that,
pretend you never saw it.

535
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,200
Do you want to take down
the man who did this?

536
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,360
More than anything.

537
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
All right, well then trust me!

538
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,640
Okay? There'll be nothing we can use,
no forensics, nothing!

539
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,920
- And he'll wriggle out of this. Again!
- John.

540
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,560
You're a police officer.
This is a murdered woman.

541
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,216
Her family are waiting,
going out of their minds,

542
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,680
and you want to lock her
back up and walk away?

543
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,840
This is about the law, not retribution.

544
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,480
I'm not asking for your approval, son.

545
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,280
Just your silence.

546
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,040
I won't volunteer any information but,

547
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,040
I won't lie for you, either.

548
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,840
What you're doing is wrong.

549
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,560
- Yeah, I know.
- Why do it then?

550
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,160
'Cause it's right.

551
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,360
Ian? I need you.

552
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Detective Sergeant Ripley.

553
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,480
How nice to see you.

554
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,760
No, no, no. No broken bones.

555
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,640
Yeah, we think it was the husband.

556
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,720
He's got some issues
he needs to work through.

557
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,600
I'll call you back. You off?

558
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,560
Just for a bit. I've got to.

559
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,880
Well, is it me? Did I do something?

560
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,880
No. I'm sorry.

561
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,040
I'm sorry, it's just...

562
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,120
It's John. He makes me so angry,
I don't know what to do.

563
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,600
I've got to get out.
Just walk it off or something.

564
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,800
He's coming your way.

565
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,400
All right. Got it.

566
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,120
All right.

567
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,400
I wonder, does John Luther
ever discuss his private life with you?

568
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,840
- No.
- Not his wife?

569
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,480
- Her lover?
- No.

570
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,440
You are aware of his history
of instability.

571
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,840
I'm aware of it, yes, although
I'm not sure of its relevance.

572
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,640
Well, it may be relevant
if it ever gives you pause

573
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,000
to question his decisions.

574
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,760
Um, my dad taught me to
question all judgements, sir.

575
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,600
I do apologise.

576
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,600
Let me rephrase, for clarity.

577
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,360
How do you judge the quality

578
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,640
of John Luther's
current operational decisions?

579
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,040
Yeah.

580
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,560
Well, it could be said that the merit
of any operational decision

581
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,320
can only be judged on its outcome.

582
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,560
As long as that decision was taken
within the boundaries of the law.

583
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,360
It could be said, yes.

584
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,480
But are you saying it?

585
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,360
I'm just saying, it could be said.

586
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,560
Do you know where Luther is,
right this minute?

587
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,880
I do not, sir.

588
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,520
Guyv.

589
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,200
- Ah. You've found him?
- Yes, sir.

590
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,320
Ah. Detective Chief Inspector Luther.

591
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,800
You pass, like night, from land to land.

592
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,240
I do. I really do.

593
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,040
There's a coffee shop not far away.

594
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,760
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

595
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,720
Let's.

596
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,560
- Who's this?
- So how's it going, Lucien?

597
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,320
I'm sorry. Who exactly is this?

598
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,760
Listen. They've planted
evidence at the crime scene.

599
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,880
They tried to frame me once before.

600
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,920
They couldn't do it then
and they won't be able to do it now.

601
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,040
All right, well, I'll be off then.

602
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,840
- Wait!
- Look, I can make this go away.

603
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,680
Two hundred thousand, in cash.
I know you've got it.

604
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,960
I can't get hold of that.
Not in time. Not in cash.

605
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,960
Well, you see, I think you can.

606
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,120
My mate, the big one who smacked you,

607
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,080
he's waiting on warrants as we speak.

608
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,320
The crime scene is clear
of surveillance until then.

609
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,320
That gives me a window of less
than an hour to make this work for you.

610
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,920
Now if you don't want to pay for it,
that's your call.

611
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,120
I'll give you 125, cash.

612
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,760
That'll have to do.

613
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,480
- Where will we meet?
- Finsbury Park Station.

614
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,960
Platform 2, north bound, half an hour.

615
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,080
John Luther didn't do that to you,
I'm afraid.

616
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,320
I did.

617
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,040
Why?

618
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,680
Why? I couldn't help myself.

619
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,720
I don't believe that.

620
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,360
See, I don't think you, of all people,

621
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,640
ever do anything
unless you decide to do it.

622
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,960
No, it's true. I'm a bit like that.

623
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,640
A bit random. Slightly kooky.

624
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,200
- Kooky?
- Absolutely.

625
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,480
Okay, Mark.
I did this because I don't like you.

626
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,960
And because I wanted to toy with John.

627
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,800
Ah. It's a bit like
pulling legs off flies.

628
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,600
Why are you here, now?

629
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,600
Because I'm sorry.

630
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,360
- No, you're not.
- No, no, I'm not.

631
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,360
I was just trying to empathise.

632
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,440
I'm here because
this has gone just far enough

633
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,920
and what I need you to do
now is pick up that phone

634
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,520
and withdraw the complaint.

635
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,360
And if I refuse?

636
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,400
What if somebody actually
stood up to you and refused?

637
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,560
Mmm. Well, then. I'd have to leave.

638
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,080
And then one night,

639
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,440
I'd have to come back.

640
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,680
I'm not building a legal case
against you, John.

641
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,160
This is about moral codes.

642
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,600
And my standard of proof

643
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,320
is much lower than yours.

644
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,920
And if you breach that code in any way,
then we let you go.

645
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,640
Quietly and without fuss.

646
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,960
- And you'd recommend that, would you?
- Oh, it's not what I want.

647
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,560
My recommendation will be that you are
suspended, immediately and indefinitely.

648
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,800
And meanwhile,

649
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,000
Kirsten Ross, hmm?

650
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,600
Many fine officers are
working on the case.

651
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,000
For what it's worth, I, um,

652
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,560
wouldn't want it to
end like this for you.

653
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,960
But there's no place in the service
for dirty coppers.

654
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,560
No matter how well-intentioned.

655
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,000
Schenk.

656
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,560
When?

657
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,360
All right. Yes, I will.

658
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,640
Mark North put in a call

659
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,200
to Detective Chief
Superintendent Teller.

660
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,000
Apparently, Mr North
no longer seems to believe

661
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,920
that the street robbers knew his name,

662
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,600
or yours, indeed.

663
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,080
Witness memory,

664
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,600
funny old thing.

665
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,600
He's withdrawn the allegation.

666
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,480
So, uh, well, what now?

667
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,240
You'll return to your case.

668
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
Without prejudice.

669
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,520
I didn't want to come for you, John.

670
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,040
But they sent me to do a job.

671
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,320
And if they send for me again,
I will come again.

672
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,120
And I will take you down,

673
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,760
even if it means that I won't be able
to look myself in the eye afterwards.

674
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,640
Well, I know that feeling.

675
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,680
Fuck!

676
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,560
I've got you.

677
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,200
I have got you now.

678
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,320
Okay, that's enough of that.

679
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,320
Lucien Burgess.

680
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,560
Don't think I can watch any more.

681
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,680
Did you seriously think
that you could entrap me?

682
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,360
Not really, no.

683
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,200
No, that blood there was
from a nice piece of steak, sirloin,

684
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,520
I was going to have for my tea tonight

685
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,120
in celebration of meeting you here.

686
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,240
At the crime scene.

687
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,640
You came of your own free will.

688
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,800
You brought luminol.

689
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,560
To look for blood traces.

690
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,640
Hmm.

691
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,880
That's not enough.

692
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,640
Oh, I think that it is.

693
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,800
- Do you?
- Yes.

694
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,440
Well, DCI Luther.

695
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,080
First you, um,

696
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,680
you assault me.

697
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,320
You publicly assault me!

698
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,600
Why can't you show me some respect?

699
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,760
Then a police officer phones me.

700
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,880
He tells me you've
been trying to frame me.

701
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,280
He tells me where the crime scene is.

702
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,240
Is that your defence?

703
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,440
Because that call, that was my mate.

704
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,200
We set you up, Lucien,
you've been outplayed.

705
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,320
I look forward to seeing
you prove any of that.

706
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,760
Oh, Luther.

707
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,040
Shall we?

708
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,680
Turn around.

709
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,720
Good day's work?

710
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,800
- Goodish.
- Anyway. This is her.

711
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,720
Alice Morgan,
meeting up with the wee girl

712
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,360
who beat up your wife's boyfriend.

713
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,216
Don't know whether she's
giving her money, drugs.

714
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,440
Either way, you've got her.

715
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,840
- Cheers.
- You take care, now.

716
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,640
Beware of geeks bearing gifts.

717
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,840
Justin.

718
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,240
- Look...
- I said nothing.

719
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,400
And I won't say anything.

720
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,120
But you can't go on like this.

721
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,480
You just can't.

722
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,920
Hmm, what's this?

723
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,560
Blackmail now?

724
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,320
No.

725
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,840
This thing, this weird thing between us.
It has to end.

726
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,560
Why?

727
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,640
It's not right, Alice.

728
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,320
It started off,
because I was scared of you,

729
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,360
and I thought if I could be your friend,
I could control you.

730
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,080
And I can't control you.

731
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
I'm still scared of you.

732
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,480
I'm scared of you, too.

733
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,280
You want to send me to prison.

734
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,520
What you did to Mark nearly cost me.

735
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,040
I wouldn't have let it.

736
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,280
I know, I know you really think that.

737
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,880
And I think, in your own way,
your intentions were good.

738
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,840
But hurting Mark doesn't
bring Zoe back to me.

739
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,400
That's not how people work.
That's not how they think.

740
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,080
I'll see you soon.

741
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,400
Zoe, are you all...

742
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,760
What are you doing here?

743
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,920
- Saying sorry.
- Sorry for what?

744
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,520
For not believing you.

745
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,360
What they said you did it's...
It's not in your nature.

746
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,520
I should've known that of all
the people in the world...

747
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,240
I should've known.

748
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,200
And I should have said something.
Been there.

749
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
You're obsessive, you're...

750
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,400
Driven.

751
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,280
God knows you're misguided.

752
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,080
But what you never are is a liar.

753
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,360
Not to me.

754
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,400
Nor a coward.

755
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,200
Oh, he's escalating fast.

756
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,440
This man's on a murder spree.

757
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,200
He's going to kill again, very soon.

758
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
I can't see you any more.

759
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,080
No!

760
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,200
- He's awake.
- Who?

761
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,120
Luther.

762
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Luther!

763
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,560
Stay away from me!
Stay away from my life!

764
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,760
Do you understand?

765
00:58:20,784 --> 00:58:28,784
