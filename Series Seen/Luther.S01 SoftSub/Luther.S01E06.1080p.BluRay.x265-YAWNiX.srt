1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,760
We can still make this work.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,680
- You don't know what I've done.
- Ian!

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,456
I don't want to hurt you.
That's not what I'm here for.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,600
All I want is to trust him.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,560
- Ian Reed's here. He's got a gun!
- No, no, no!

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
- /07?
- No!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
20?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,440
Ahhh!

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,560
What have you done, Ian?

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,120
You have one new message.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,600
Rose, Rose,
it's me, it's me, Luther!

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,240
It's Ian, I think he's hurt her.
Send a medic. Please.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,960
Just send a medic over there now!

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,880
You were right.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,680
Poor bastard.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
Poor bastard, my arse. Poor Zoe!

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,400
Argh!

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,800
Argh!

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,760
Argh!

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,760
What's happening here?

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,040
- And you are, sir?
- Mark North. Where's Zoe?

22
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,800
Ah, Jesus God.

23
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
No, no, no...

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,480
♪ Love is like a sin

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
♪ My love

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,320
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,520
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,960
♪ She will love you like a fly

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,880
♪ Will never love you again ♪

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,640
What's going on?

31
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,280
About an hour ago
we received a 999 call.

32
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,760
Gunshots heard, 23 Parthenial Street.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,400
First responders found a woman dead.

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,040
- Single gunshot wound.
- Zoe Luther.

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,096
- No...
- Don't speak up for him, Justin.

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,440
Not yet.

37
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,600
He argued with her.
That doesn't mean he did it.

38
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,720
He was there.

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,696
His fingerprints are all over the place,

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,960
in his wife's blood.

41
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,120
She's murdered, he's in the wind.

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,800
What does that tell you?

43
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it.

44
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,240
Painful as it may be, I'm afraid the
evidence currently tell us otherwise.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,320
You ready?

46
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,280
Ready.

47
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,200
First thing to know,
we're in damage control.

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,640
We keep an airtight lid on this
until it's resolved.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,160
That means no press,
no briefings and no leaks.

50
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,440
Well, the press will
get there soon enough.

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
Which is why we need Luther
in custody without delay.

52
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,640
I don't want any
"Killer policeman at large" headlines.

53
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,800
Are we clear?

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,680
Teller is in charge
of the investigation, but, uh,

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,640
Martin will be assisting heavily.

56
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,160
You'll give him
your absolute cooperation.

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,480
But you need one of us
there on the ground to advise.

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,840
- Someone who knows him.
- Yeah? And should that be you?

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,280
Absolutely, it should be me, yeah.

60
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
Right, so do you believe
John Luther shot his wife tonight?

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't be sure. Not yet.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
- It's just too early...
- Exactly!

63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,496
The last thing I need
is for this operation to be hindered

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,760
by your celebrated loyalty.

65
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,296
DS Ripley, you'll assist
Detective Chief Superintendent...

66
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,800
Oh, well, with respect,
sorry, Justin, but Ripley...

67
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,440
Yeah, he may not know Luther
quite as well as you,

68
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,720
but he's a damn sight
better-placed to be non-partisan.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,520
You, you remain here,

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
you can advise as necessary.

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Sorry, I think that's a mistake.

72
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm not interested
in saving John Luther.

73
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
I want the full force of the law
stamping down on his face

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,080
before sunrise,
and I want your help to do it.

75
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
Are we clear on that?

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,520
Good. Now let's bring him in.

77
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,520
I know what you did, Ian.

78
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,320
You tried to make it
look like I killed her because you think

79
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,320
if they're coming for me, I can't
come for you. Well, you're wrong.

80
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
I am coming for you.

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,600
All I have to do is
stay free long enough to see you dead.

82
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
And I'll do that Ian.

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,680
I'll see you dead.

84
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,080
I'll see you dead.

85
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
Justin. Justin.

86
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Hey.

87
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,760
- What do you think?
- I don't know what to think.

88
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Yeah, me neither.

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,720
Thing is, though, if he didn't do it,

90
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
where the hell is he?

91
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,080
Perhaps he knows who did it,
and he's gone after them.

92
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Whatever happens, all right,

93
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,640
if you hear from him,

94
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,120
you contact me, okay?

95
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,640
Not Teller, not Schenk, me.

96
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,240
He needs his friends.

97
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
Yeah. Of course.

98
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,720
Okay.

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm sorry for your loss.

100
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
I didn't lose her.

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
She was taken from me.

102
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,000
You know why?

103
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,800
The truth of it is, we're not here to
talk "why". That comes later.

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
Right now, it's all about "who".

105
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
Meaning John Luther.

106
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,400
That is a possibility.
Yes, it's something we're looking into.

107
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,656
Oh, I can't tell you the times,
since I met Zoe,

108
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,120
I've had to talk
about this guy, John, John.

109
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,840
John, poor John.
Needy John. Broken John.

110
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,176
Now, I need to know anything that
might have happened between

111
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
John Luther and Zoe
over the last few days...

112
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,520
- They were seeing each other.
- Seeing?

113
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,960
Yep, sleeping together.

114
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
When did you find out?

115
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Look, I stayed with friends tonight.
You've only got to ask them.

116
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,800
We know where you were. When did you
find out about John and Zoe?

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Uh...

118
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,480
About a day and a half ago.

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,520
I said to her, "Choose.
Choose between us,

120
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
"but stick with your choice.”

121
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
And she chose me.

122
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
She chose me.

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
And she paid for it.

124
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
If that does turn out to be the case,

125
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,840
what you must never ever do
is blame yourself.

126
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,496
If you pull the trigger
on another human being,

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,080
the responsibility for that
is yours and yours alone.

128
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,440
If John killed Zoe,

129
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,960
I will not rest
until I see him punished for it.

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,640
If you'll excuse me,

131
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,360
I'll have another officer
come and take an official statement.

132
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
Sorry, I, um...

133
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,400
No, no, it's me.

134
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,840
Sorry, I'm miles away.

135
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
Is this actually happening?

136
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,240
No. In a few minutes, I'm gonna wake up

137
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
and my alarm's going to go off.

138
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,440
By the time I get to work,

139
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,880
I'll have forgotten I ever dreamt it.

140
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,560
Um, he... He just called me.

141
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,960
Who?

142
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,760
- Who do you think?
- When?

143
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,920
- Just now.
- What did he say? Where is he?

144
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
He just said that I did it. Again.

145
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
Oh, Ian.

146
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,400
I know what you did, Ian.

147
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,520
You tried to make it look like
I killed her because you think

148
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,480
if they're coming for me, I can't
come for you. Well, you're wrong.

149
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,880
I just don't understand it.

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Why would he project it onto me?

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,160
I don't know what to do.
I'm telling you this, it feels like

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm betraying him, you know?

153
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,800
Well, it doesn't matter now,
you've told me.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,336
See if you can
track the phone he's using.

155
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Get a lead on where he might be.

156
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
- Yeah, okay.
- If we can pin

157
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,600
this mess on mental illness,

158
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,760
then I can't be held accountable
and the unit might survive.

159
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,760
Okay, all right.
Wow, I hadn't really thought of that.

160
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
Yeah, well, you don't
have to think like that. I do.

161
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,320
I should never have taken him back.

162
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, I knew the risk!

163
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,600
God knows they warned me,
"He's nitro glycerine."

164
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,280
And I didn't listen,
because I was so bent on making it work.

165
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,560
I just so wanted to make it work!

166
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,880
Boss.

167
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,400
It's not your fault.

168
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
It's not your fault.

Zoe's dead.

177
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,800
Are we speaking figuratively?

178
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
No.

179
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,720
Did you kill her?

180
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,360
- Would it matter?
- To me?

181
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,080
Well, it's nice to see you
retain your sense of humour.

182
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,400
I mean it.

183
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,120
Well, I liked her.

184
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,440
But if you killed her,
I'm sure you had a reason.

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,800
Well, I didn't.

186
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
Fine.

187
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,640
Who did?

188
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,640
He only smashed symbols
of her relationship with this new chap,

189
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
which makes for a very intimate scene.

190
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,080
And we know that
he smashes things when he's angry.

191
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,080
All of which tends
to align us in Luther's direction.

192
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,280
Unless this was staged for our benefit.

193
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600
By whom?

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,160
Mr North?

195
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
It's worth considering, surely.

196
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,160
Well, even if he didn't have an alibi,

197
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,000
when a man stages a murder scene,
he tends to make it look like

198
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,080
how he thinks it should.

199
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,640
It's always wrong.

200
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,240
But this scene is
consistent with the thesis.

201
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,360
And to stage such a scene correctly

202
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
would require a very chilly heart.

203
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,720
Which doesn't seem
compatible with a crime of rage.

204
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,960
But it's not right.

205
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Tell me how.

206
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,560
This kind of killing, jealous husband,
sex, rage and all the rest of it.

207
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,920
You'd expect a knife, a bludgeon
of some kind. A fist. Not a gun.

208
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,800
You don't like the choice of weapon,
so that makes Luther innocent?

209
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,000
I want him to be innocent.

210
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,896
But if he's not, then I'll do my job
properly and without hesitation.

211
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,440
That's a very brave answer.

212
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,280
It's not supposed to be.
It's just the way it is.

213
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,280
So are you going to kill him?

214
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,120
I've thought about it.

215
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,360
That's all I've thought about.

216
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,440
Then why are you here?

217
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,080
I just need a safe place to think.

218
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,880
You know, in 1988,

219
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,120
two psychologists published an article

220
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,520
arguing that
positive self-deception is a normal

221
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,040
and advantageous part
of most people's lives.

222
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,040
It turns out, people lie to
themselves about three things.

223
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,920
They view themselves
in implausibly positive ways,

224
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,720
they think they have
far more control over their lives

225
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
than they actually do,

226
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,080
and they believe the future will be

227
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,040
better than the evidence
of the present can possibly justify.

228
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,040
But you're way beyond that now.

229
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
You're on the other side
of that particular mirror.

230
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,440
Lying to yourself

231
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
isn't going to help any more.

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,520
So, please,

233
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
tell me again.

234
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,840
Why are you here?

235
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,840
Alice, I need you to help me.

236
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,760
You're asking me to be your accomplice?

237
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,440
Yes.

238
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,760
Excellent.

239
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
Where do we start?

240
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
Hello?

241
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,200
Justin. Can you talk?

242
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,440
Uh, absolutely, yeah, I can talk.

243
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
- You at the house?
- Uh, yeah.

244
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
It wasn't me.

245
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
Yeah, I know, I think.

246
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,400
If Luther was going to do
something like this,

247
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,440
he'd make it look
like Mark North did it.

248
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,920
He might be insane, but he's not stupid.

249
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
You're a good man, Justin.

250
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,640
So where are you right now?

251
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,480
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

252
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,120
I don't doubt it. Any info at your end?

253
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,640
No, I'm not going to compromise
you more than I have to, okay?

254
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,960
But don't trust Ian Reed.

255
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,960
Sorry, it's a bit clattery over here.
Can you repeat that?

256
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,480
Don't trust Ian Reed.

257
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,080
Um, can you run the details by me?

258
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
Not now.

259
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,720
- Who is that?
- Um, one moment.

260
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Telephone intelligence.

261
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,080
Trace on Luther's phone. No news.

262
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,840
Um, okay, I'm going to
need a brief precis of what you've got.

263
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,000
Soon as you like.

264
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,400
Well, as soon as there's time,
I will explain.

265
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
We may have found the gun.

266
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,040
- Did you get that?
- I got that.

267
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
Got it.

268
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,080
It's a nine millimetre Beretta.

269
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
Pass it to me, I'll clear the chamber.

270
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,040
- Chamber cleared.
- Bag it.

271
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,280
Sir.

272
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,040
Forensics in the house
are circumstantial.

273
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,640
This gun is hard evidence.

274
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,400
And I don't want it contaminated
or going missing

275
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,560
as a consequence of
some police officer's

276
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
- misguided sense of loyalty.
- Seriously?

277
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh, they're good men,

278
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,080
but sometimes goodness
attracts its own temptations.

279
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
So what do we do?

280
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,400
Well first rule of evidence,

281
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,400
limit the amount of transfers.

282
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,160
Take it to the lab ourselves.

283
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,640
They found it.

284
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,160
Found what?

285
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
The gun.

286
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,160
Well, you didn't pull the trigger,
doesn't matter.

287
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,640
It's got no value as evidence.

288
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,720
No, but if Ian Reed left a gun,
he left it for a reason.

289
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,080
Meaning?

290
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,360
There was a gun.

291
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,080
There was a gun,
I touched it, I gave it to him.

292
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
It's got my fingerprints all over it.

293
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,760
If that's the gun he used on Zoe,

294
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
my fingerprints are all he needs.

295
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
And so?

296
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
So it's on its way to ballistic testing,

297
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,920
fingerprint analysis, DNA analysis.

298
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,080
Well, if that happens,
it's over for you.

299
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,600
If that happens.
But it's not going to happen.

300
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,240
Right. They're leaving from there,
taking the evidence to there.

301
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,800
We're here.
We can get there before them,

302
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,280
as long as Schenk
doesn't use the blues and twos.

303
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,576
What do you know about stealing cars?

304
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,080
- Nothing.
- Doesn't matter.

305
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,360
‘Cause I know everything
about stealing cars.

306
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,000
- Hmm.
- Do you got anything for my...

307
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
Mmm-hmm, thank you.

308
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,480
They'll know it's you.
You're not an easy man to disguise.

309
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,440
- That's not the point.
- Well, what is?

310
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,040
Deniability.

311
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
- Look, if we get caught...
- I say you forced me to help.

312
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
You threatened my life.

313
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,080
- You're not even joking, are you?
- Absolutely not.

314
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
What's wrong?

315
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,256
Well, do you ever step outside
yourself, wonder what you're doing

316
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,680
and think you've gone mad?

317
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
No.

318
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,440
Look, you and I

319
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,720
are who we are.

320
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,360
So I need to tell you this, John,
of all the people in the world,

321
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
I would never betray you.

322
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,320
We're on Iron Road.

323
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,040
Should be about 20 minutes. Over.

324
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,720
- Are you armed?
- No. You?

325
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,040
No. Urgent assistance required.
Repeat, urgent assistance required.

326
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,960
- Where is it?
- In the glove box.

327
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
- Glove box?
- Yeah.

328
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,960
- Wait, hit me.
- What?

329
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,136
You've got to hit me,
you've got to make it look right.

330
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,320
Go on.

331
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,120
This will achieve nothing.
You're not acting in a reasonable way.

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,640
Justin. What's happening?

333
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
He took the gun.

334
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,561
What do you mean? Wh...
What do you mean, he took the gun?

335
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,160
We were taking it to the lab.
He intercepted us, DCI Schenk and me.

336
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,520
Shit.

337
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,560
All right.

338
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,640
Okay, you listen to me.

339
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,520
You need to come in.

340
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,160
All right?

341
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,320
We need to start facing facts.

342
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
What do you mean?

343
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,120
I mean, he's not behaving
like an innocent man, is he?

344
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,360
Why'd you do it?

345
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,280
Hmm. Do what?

346
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,320
Your parents.

347
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
Because I wanted to.

348
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
How could you want that?

349
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,776
Well, let's put Ian Reed
in a room with you,

350
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,640
and then let's talk about
who wants what.

351
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,360
Are you sure
you don't want to keep this?

352
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,000
No.

353
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,560
No guns.

354
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,800
Suit yourself.

355
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,200
Maintenance!

356
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,000
It's him.

357
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,640
What do you want, Ian?

358
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,800
I just want to talk.

359
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,400
You sound scared.

360
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
Are you scared?

361
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm scared.

362
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
Yeah, you should be.

363
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
You should be scared.

364
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,760
I can't handle this.
I can't deal with this, John.

365
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
It's in my brain. It's like...

366
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,280
It's like my head's full of spiders.

367
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,120
I can't stand it. I think I'm going mad.

368
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,840
Honestly, mate, I can't stand it.

369
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's not going to stop me
coming for you.

370
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000
Look, I can't undo it.

371
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,520
All right? I wish I could.

372
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,440
Hand to God,

373
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,000
if I could go back,
I'd rather it was me that was dead.

374
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,720
I'd rather be dead than go through this.

375
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,400
That can be arranged, Ian.

376
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Listen, just meet me, okay?

377
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,240
Please.

378
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,360
Just, uh, just hear
what I've got to say.

379
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,040
And then, after that
whatever happens is in your hands.

380
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,040
All right then.

381
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,680
9:00. Faraday Memorial.

382
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,280
You're not going
to do what he wants?

383
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,920
Yes, I am.

384
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,760
Shouldn't you be at home?

385
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,400
It's just a cracked rib. I'll be fine.

386
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Okay.

387
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,160
Do we have any idea
of the accomplice's ID? The woman?

388
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,040
Um... I don't know.
Young. White. Slim build.

389
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,760
Also wore a stocking.

390
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,480
- She didn't speak?
- No.

391
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,280
- But it was Luther?
- It was Luther.

392
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,120
You're 100% positive?

393
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,680
Well, he wore a cursory disguise,
a stocking mask,

394
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,280
but given that, I'd say

395
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,320
95%.

396
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,640
Do you know what a decent defence
called 95%? Reasonable doubt.

397
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,240
Was it him?

398
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,840
- On balance, I'd guess so. Yes.
- You'd guess?

399
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,640
I couldn't swear to it.

400
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,920
He killed his wife! Zoe!

401
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,281
He's stolen the only hard evidence
we have to convict him!

402
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,960
He busted your ribs! Wake up!
Stop protecting him!

403
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,120
I'm not.

404
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,040
John just called.

405
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,160
He wants to set up a meeting.

406
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,720
Rose, Rose, I can't use this.

407
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,536
If we put you unprotected
in John's path, he's going to kill you.

408
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,080
It's not going to come to that.

409
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,056
He's convinced you killed his wife.

410
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,936
He's delusional.
So, actually, it may come to that.

411
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
Listen, I trust him. It'll be all right.

412
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,040
- I can bring him in.
- I'm not sending you in naked.

413
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,960
No more than I like doing it.

414
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,800
But this is John we're talking about.

415
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,280
Look, you owe him nothing.

416
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,760
All right? He owes you. He owes us both.

417
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,320
You're not going in there unprotected.
Final word.

418
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,880
All right, but I'm not using this.

419
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,600
So what kind of thing you talking about?

420
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,800
Tactical weapons support.

421
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,040
If it looks for one moment...
For one moment...

422
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,296
- Oh, no, no.
- Your life's in danger,

423
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,840
I give the order.

424
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,336
- Rose...
- All right, we do it like this

425
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,280
or we don't do it at all.

426
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,120
Your call.

427
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
All right, okay, fine.

428
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,040
Fine.

429
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
Bring in the shooters.

430
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,600
Don't speak. Drive.

431
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,560
You and I
have been through something today.

432
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,960
And that makes us comrades-in-arms.

433
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,640
Yeah, I suppose.

434
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,880
And so, as a comrade, I'm asking you

435
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,280
what's troubling you?

436
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,040
In what way?

437
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,400
People like you and me,

438
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,400
we know how people look
when they're hiding something.

439
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,080
- Is this an accusation?
- Of what?

440
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,680
An atypical reaction to betrayal?

441
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,760
- What do you want?
- To know what you think.

442
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,880
- About what?
- Luther's psychotic.

443
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,160
He claims to believe Detective Chief
Inspector Reed killed his wife.

444
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,440
If that's so, why did he go to
the trouble of stealing back that gun?

445
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,280
It doesn't fit the delusional framework.

446
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,360
No, I suppose not.

447
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,640
So what's going on in Luther's head?

448
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,680
Who can say?

449
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,720
Well... Who indeed?

450
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,560
No!

451
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,720
Mark!

452
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,280
Hey! Mark, listen to me.

453
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,040
Listen to me!

454
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,680
I didn't do it.

455
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,640
It wasn't me.

456
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Luther set the meet, here.

457
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,600
For what? A chat?

458
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
- Apparently.
- No, he's lying.

459
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,560
Of course he's lying, but why?

460
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,296
All you need to do is
be there at 9:00 a.m.

461
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,000
They'll be leaving, they'll ask you to
wait until they return.

462
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,520
- You'll be alone.
- So I do what you say and then what?

463
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,320
And then you say you want to leave.
They can't stop you.

464
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,760
Then you come back to me.

465
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,800
You're putting Reed
at very considerable risk.

466
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm mindful of that, sir.
But he's right.

467
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,121
This is the best way
to bring Luther in without bloodshed.

468
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,360
And Reed?

469
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,200
Reed will be elsewhere.

470
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,760
CO0-19?

471
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,280
Kitted and ready to go.

472
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,360
And if circumstances warrant,

473
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,760
you won't hesitate
to give the kill order?

474
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,000
Absolutely not.

475
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,480
Okay, okay.

476
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
You're not coming?

477
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,880
This doesn't fall within my compass,
for which I'm grateful.

478
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,440
I've no desire to see what happens next.

479
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,680
You know, you don't have to be there.

480
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,120
I do.

481
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,520
We ready?

482
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,640
I need to speak to you.

483
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,960
Okay, of course. It's just that
we have a live situation right now.

484
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,760
That's all right. I can wait.

485
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,000
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

486
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,400
I'll look after Mr North.

487
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,576
There's really no need. I can wait.

488
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Nonsense. I'll keep you company
until the others return.

489
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Mr North, if I may?

490
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,920
This isn't going to work
if you can't control your temper.

491
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,880
It's a weakness. He'll use it.

492
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,280
- I can control it.
- Well, you'd better.

493
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,040
'Cause if I understand correctly, police
marksmen don't shoot to wound.

494
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,480
No. They shoot to stop.

495
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,120
Go for the centre of mass.

496
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
Here. The heart.

497
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,680
How apropos.

498
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,040
There he is, by the stairs.

499
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,720
- Sergeant?
- We've got a clear shot and good to go.

500
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,920
On my order. Not before.

501
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Received and understood.

502
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,120
What do you want me to do?

503
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,760
Kill you?

504
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,880
Forgive you?

505
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,600
I don't understand
how you could believe I did this.

506
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
You've changed your tune
since the last time we spoke, Ian.

507
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,640
No, John.

508
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
I believe you did it, Ian,
because you did it!

509
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,760
If you really believe that, deep down,

510
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,080
then why did you steal the gun?

511
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,320
The gun.

512
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,640
Yeah, you did a decent job with that.

513
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,480
But it's gone now.

514
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,776
And so is the only piece of hard
evidence they've got against me.

515
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,160
So whatever you're trying to do...

516
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,920
Whatever you're trying to do
to save yourself, it's over.

517
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
It's done.

518
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,856
You're not answering my question.

519
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,960
I think I am!

520
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,096
But if you didn't do it,

521
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,880
how could there be
any hard evidence against you?

522
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,680
- How's that possible?
- What are you trying to say?

523
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,560
I've spoken to the doctors, John.

524
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,000
And what's happening to you
is called a dissociative state.

525
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,120
It's the mind distancing itself

526
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,560
from things that are
too much for it to process.

527
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,560
You're blaming me because you can't
bear to confront what you've done.

528
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,880
You're in pain, you're distressed.

529
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,800
You need help. So come home. All right?

530
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Let us help you.

531
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,600
Thing is, Ian,
you didn't come alone, did you?

532
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,640
Wouldn't have the balls.

533
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,920
No, you came with CO-19, who, right now,

534
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,920
have their assault rifles
trained on my centre of mass.

535
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,400
And we do not shoot to stop.

536
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,320
Not in our game, no. We shoot to kill!

537
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,720
Ain't that right, fellas?

538
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,080
- Sergeant?
- Still clear and good to go.

539
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Ain't that right, boss?

540
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
You got the centre of mass, right here.

541
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,200
‘Cause that's what
we're here for, isn't it?

542
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,800
You prod me, you wind me up,

543
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,240
I lose it, I threaten your life.

544
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,200
And then you have
a legal reason to shoot me.

545
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,920
Bang, bang, bang. There goes your
problems, all out of the window.

546
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,640
Oh, Luther, couldn't contain his temper.

547
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,400
John, John, listen to me. You're ill.

548
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,640
And you're sick!

549
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,680
I wonder,

550
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,656
are you even interested
in why I've come here

551
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,840
if I knew what you was up to?

552
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,800
I don't know. Maybe you wanted to
get something off your chest.

553
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,680
About something you did
to Henry Madsen, maybe?

554
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,440
Oh, nice try, no, no.
I've got nothing to confess.

555
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,640
Henry Madsen fell. And you know
how hard I tried to save him.

556
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,040
I know how hard you tried.

557
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
No, I...

558
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,440
I came out here...

559
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,600
Still clear, still clear.

560
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,520
...to get you away from
the locker rooms.

561
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,480
What's he saying?

562
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,200
Where you're keeping the diamonds.

563
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,600
Or where you were,
up until about five minutes ago.

564
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,880
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

565
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,920
Tick tick tick.
I wonder where they could have gone.

566
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,520
I didn't hurt Zoe, John.

567
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,520
- Ian, you do me a favour.
- What?

568
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,080
Don't say her name.

569
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,840
Not any more.
No more. All right? It's over.

570
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,840
What can I do to prove it? Just tell me.

571
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,440
Tell me, tell me what I can do.

572
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,736
I actually thought
I could listen to this.

573
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,080
I thought I could stand here
and listen to you lie!

574
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
To my face! Even now!

575
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,616
How can you stand there
and lie like it's nothing?

576
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,736
Because I didn't do it!

577
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,360
He goes for a weapon, you take the shot.

578
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
I didn't do it.

579
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,080
I loved Zoe, John.
She was like family to me.

580
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
Wait to see a weapon,
wait to see a weapon.

581
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,600
So please, for her. For Zoe.
Please just come home.

582
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,240
- Don't!
- I love you too, man.

583
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,200
Don't say that! You piece of shit.

584
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,616
All I want to do is hear you say it.

585
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,360
Just say it one time.
Just say what you did.

586
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,240
Say it to me.

587
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,480
Ian, mate, say it to me now!

588
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,200
- I can't!
- Say it!

589
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,600
No, because I didn't do it, John!

590
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,960
You did.

591
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,680
- He's got a knife.
- You killed her.

592
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
It's your fault!

593
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,640
- Do it. Take the shot.
- John! Run!

594
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,240
Run!

595
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,000
Got a shot, ma'am.

596
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,560
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.
Don't shoot him in the back.

597
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,320
All units, be alert.
Suspect John Luther leaving the area

598
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,440
on foot, heading south-east, fast.

599
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,800
- Shit!
- Head him off! Stop him.

600
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,200
Do you know what you've done?

601
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,160
- Yes, I do, ma'am.
- Don't "ma'am" me.

602
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,320
Badge!

603
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,120
Arrest this man.

604
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,560
- Come on!
- Ah!

605
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,400
Come on!

606
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,240
- Ah!
- How'd it go?

607
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,560
I got what I wanted.

608
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,040
And how close did you come
to getting shot for it?

609
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,440
I didn't get shot.

610
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,960
Fine. Your funeral.

611
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,040
That dick!

612
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,720
- Let it go.
- Would you?

613
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,040
"Run, John". What was he thinking?

614
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,720
He thought he was being John's friend

615
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,640
and it's already cost him everything.
So let it go.

616
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,880
What, you suspended him?

617
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,560
And charged him as an accessory.

618
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,480
Ripley's finished.

619
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,080
Yeah, that's what being John's
friend does for you in the end.

620
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,360
We all paid a price for it.
Come on, let's get back.

621
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,200
Just, um,

622
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
once more, if I may.

623
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,240
Um, Luther came to see you,

624
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,080
- uh, he was distressed...
- He was greatly distressed, yeah.

625
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,160
It feels unseemly to keep probing this,

626
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,760
such a raw wound, so soon.

627
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,440
I must ask what he said.

628
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,120
He said he didn't do it.

629
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,520
Well, I suppose all things are possible,

630
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,960
although not equally.

631
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,560
Is this going to take much longer?

632
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,040
No, I, uh,

633
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,240
think I've got everything
I want from you.

634
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,160
If I could just ask you
to wait a little bit longer.

635
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,400
The insight you've given
into his mental state,

636
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,656
- it may be of value...
- Can I please use the bathroom?

637
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,120
Of course.

638
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,960
All right. Get on with it.

639
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,320
Ian?

640
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,800
Thank you.

641
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,120
I'm sorry the... Um, um, bathroom?

642
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,840
- I was...
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

643
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,160
Yeah, it's out there, on the right.

644
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,000
The, um, flush is broken
on the cubicle nearest the wall.

645
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,320
You might want to watch that.

646
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,080
I will, thank you.

647
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,720
Listen, uh,

648
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,120
I'm sorry

649
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
for your loss. She was very special.

650
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,240
That's very kind. She was.

651
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,960
Excuse me.

652
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,480
I, uh, I need to be away from here.

653
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,280
Oh, yes, possibly that's the best thing.

654
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,120
We could arrange an escort,
a protective detail.

655
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,560
I don't think Luther will be back.

656
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,960
Even so, I, uh,
I hope you're not on your own.

657
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,720
It isn't healthy.

658
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,880
Yeah, I, uh, I have somewhere to go.

659
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,080
As you wish.

660
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,200
Come on. Come on.

661
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
It's Mark. I'm on my way.

662
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
All right.

663
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,640
Hi, this is DCI Reed.
Can you do me a favour?

664
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,920
Uh, can you run me a trace and track?

665
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,040
Okay, it's Mark North.

666
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,240
Tick tick tick.
I wonder where they could have gone.

667
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,040
John! Run! Run!

668
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,160
John! Run! Run!

669
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,960
How long did you want to
become a police officer, Justin?

670
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,040
Since I can remember.

671
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,480
And why?

672
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,360
Why a police officer?

673
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,840
What does it matter?

674
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,320
Big family?

675
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,320
- Yeah, pretty big.
- They're proud of you?

676
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,040
Yes.

677
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,200
Family's important to you, isn't it?

678
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,920
Family,

679
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,680
loyalty, trust.

680
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,440
And rules are important, too.

681
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,880
- Aren't they?
- Yes.

682
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,080
Yes!

683
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,680
So why throw it all away for nothing?

684
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,200
You're not a fool.

685
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,880
What have you got to lose?

686
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,360
Your pride, your self-respect?

687
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,480
Your job?

688
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,040
Well, they're all gone!

689
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,480
Something's happening
that no one else can quite see.

690
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,400
Well, I want to see it!

691
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,120
What's happening?

692
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,320
- Excuse me.
- What is it, Martin?

693
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,640
We need to find
Detective Chief Inspector Reed.

694
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,640
Most urgently.

695
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,320
Shh.

696
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,840
So you've got North
doing your dirty work for you.

697
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,000
Your dead wife's boyfriend,
stealing evidence.

698
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,960
What is it about you, John?
You corrupt everything around you.

699
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,520
You turn everything to shit.

700
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,360
All this.

701
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,640
All this, what you did...

702
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,720
For what? For greed?

703
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,600
Because you were scared?

704
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,720
Well, now, look.

705
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,120
What do you want me to say, John?

706
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,920
Huh?

707
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,440
What, I wish I hadn't killed Zoe?

708
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,400
I do.

709
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,000
I wish I hadn't.
I didn't go there meaning to.

710
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,560
But I did.

711
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,960
And so, now we're here,
just do what you got to do.

712
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,920
All right, just commit.

713
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,560
She begged you.

714
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,880
Come on! Just get it over with.

715
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,400
It'll be a relief. I'm sick of this.

716
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,440
I know.

717
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,320
I didn't come to kill you, Ian.

718
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,040
What I wish I hadn't killed Zoe?

719
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,240
Ido. I wishl hadn't...

720
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,440
What, so all this,

721
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,160
bringing me here,
sending her boyfriend to the station,

722
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,200
stealing the diamonds,
that was all a play?

723
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,040
You set me up for a confession?

724
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
Pretty much.

725
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,456
If I was you, I'd have killed me.

726
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,656
There's nothing I'd like to do more.

727
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,280
Do it, come on.

728
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,480
I've come so far, I don't even care.

729
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,520
You know this is the end for me.

730
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,040
No.

731
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,240
- Why not?
- Because I choose not to.

732
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,480
Did she ever tell you
about her and me? Zoe?

733
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,760
Oh, no, she didn't.
Of course she didn't. I knew that.

734
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,120
What do you mean?

735
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,040
It started one night...

736
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,080
You'd stayed away working
once too often.

737
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,280
That's not going to work, Ian.

738
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,920
She cried afterwards.

739
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,400
Yeah, washed the sheets.

740
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,760
That's one of the memories
I've got of her, crying,

741
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
naked, stuffing the sheets
into a machine.

742
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,040
Calling me an arsehole, a bastard.

743
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,880
Still made me do it again before I left.

744
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,160
It's not going to work.

745
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,936
She told me I taught her
how to really come.

746
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,400
You know, Ian, you can't play me.

747
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,040
You can't make me shoot you.

748
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,600
You can't choose...

749
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,280
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I can't play you!

750
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,600
You're John Luther!
Who sees all, knows all!

751
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,840
Come on, John,

752
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,800
after a marriage that long,
that unhappy, with a woman that needy?

753
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,376
Oh, there must have been quite a few.

754
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,200
Maybe you knew
about some of them deep down.

755
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,680
But you know what?

756
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,840
- I think I was her favourite.
- No more, Ian!

757
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,240
Because I was her revenge.

758
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,120
Every orgasm she took from me
was to pay you back.

759
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,240
Enough!

760
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,160
How does it feel, eh? You murderer.

761
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,160
Come on, how does it feel, tell me?

762
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,640
No.

763
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,040
No.

764
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,960
Ian Reed,

765
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,600
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Zoe Luther...

766
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,080
You should have done it, John!

767
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,320
Now, look what you're
making me do. Look!

768
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,640
Don't...

769
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,840
Now, look what you're making me do!

770
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,080
Ian...

771
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,240
You should have stopped me, John!

772
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,880
Ian!

773
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,880
Are you?

774
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,440
Yeah.

775
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,080
He swore he wasn't going to kill you.

776
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,920
He thought the humiliation
of prison would be worse.

777
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,920
The beatings, the rapes,

778
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,576
the incessant fear for your life,
but I told him,

779
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,800
"No, John, you're wrong.

780
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,520
"Dying would be worse."

781
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,800
Because, well,
honestly, it is, isn't it?

782
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,880
Dying's just worse.

783
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,480
So...

784
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,480
Do I pull the trigger or not?

785
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,680
No! Alice!

786
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,600
Well, I'm in favour.

787
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,320
Which leaves us 50-50,
with one vote left to cast.

788
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,840
Mark?

789
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,760
What do you think?

790
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
You're a liar.

791
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,400
- He is a liar.
- Deciding vote, Mark.

792
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,800
Alice. Alice, don't.

793
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,120
Wasn't it enough to take her life?
Where is your respect?

794
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,200
Where is your shame?

795
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,576
She didn't look like a whore,
though, did she?

796
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,760
Don't listen to him.

797
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,480
Don't listen to him.

798
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,560
I mean, not dressed, anyway.

799
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,440
But strip her down,
roll her around a bit.

800
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,800
. -Oh!
Top, stop, stop!

801
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,600
Okay, listen!

802
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,640
Ian, stop! Mark, I know
how much you want

803
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,280
to see him die, but don't do it.

804
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,200
I mean, she had
a few good rides left in her.

805
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,120
Do it! Do it! Do it!

806
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,600
No, no, no!

807
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, no!

808
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,560
Now what?

809
00:57:40,584 --> 00:57:48,584
