1
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,527
- Crowds have gathered today
to hear the verdict

2
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,529
of the Swedish
police investigation

3
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,449
into celebrity surgeon
Paolo Macchiarini,

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,784
who has been accused
of medical misconduct.

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,870
Officials are hoping
for an indictment

6
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,788
to be issued today in the case

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,292
that has taken the global
medical community by storm.

8
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,674
* *

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,056
- Do you trust me?

10
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:03,229
* *

11
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,290
* *

12
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,337
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness!

13
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:34,511
* *

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,945
- Hello, Keziah.

15
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:55,323
* *

16
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,951
- The recellularization
is complete, Doctor.

17
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,369
- Wonderful.

18
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:05,625
* *

19
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,962
Now I need you
to count back from 100.

20
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,549
* *

21
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,217
Knife.

22
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,935
- * She was the one,
she was the one *

23
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,146
* She was the one.
she was the one *

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,237
- * She was the one,
she was the one *

25
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,495
* *

26
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,457
- I'm not here
to talk about politics.

27
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,125
- Benita?
- Yeah?

28
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,835
- Have you seen our girl?

29
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,463
- Shoot!
Mm.

30
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,174
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

31
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,265
Oh. You're ringing.

32
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,267
- Oh.

33
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,810
Hello?

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,980
* *

35
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,989
- Always making
such a racket, B.

36
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,284
- Says the guy dragging me
to the hospital at 1:00 a.m.

37
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,870
What happened?

38
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,163
- Ask him.

39
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,373
- Hi.

40
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,750
Is he okay?
- Yes.

41
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,169
Uh, is this your wife?
both: Ex.

42
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,338
- Okay, well, John was admitted

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,548
after he was found unconscious
in his apartment.

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,967
I've left word
for your oncologist,

45
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,137
but this is likely caused
by the brain tumor.

46
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,640
- So does that mean
the treatment is not working?

47
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,767
- It doesn't mean
anything for sure.

48
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,562
But your doctor has discussed
your prognosis?

49
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,648
- Yeah, we know.
My chances are slim.

50
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,025
- 6%. 6%.

51
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,569
That's the number they love
to throw around all the time,

52
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,198
but someone's got
to be the 6%, right?

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,575
Right.

54
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,661
Well, I'll go check
your bloodwork.

55
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,831
Just, uh, sit tight.
- Yeah, I'll be right here.

56
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,420
- You look good, B.

57
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,465
- It was
Kimmy's birthday tonight.

58
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,592
- Well, I saved you
from a wicked hangover.

59
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,388
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,933
So what do we tell Lizzi?

61
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,935
- We wait.

62
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,312
You just started
this round of treatment.

63
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,689
We don't have
any of the answers yet,

64
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,275
so I think we wait.
- Okay.

65
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,485
Okay. Yeah.

66
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,363
But, Benita...

67
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,324
I'm sick.

68
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,244
- Someone's got to be
the 6%, John.

69
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:56,379
* *

70
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,783
- Morning, Benita.
- Morning, Larry.

71
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,201
This is for me, right?
- Yep.

72
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,410
- Thank you.

73
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,329
- Morning, Benita.
- Good morning.

74
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,997
Oh, I have pitches for you.
- Great.

75
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,374
- Lunch?
- Sure.

76
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,584
Meet you in the commissary?
- Yuck. See you then.

77
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,628
Oh, you have my fugitive story?
- Uh...

78
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,880
- Tomorrow. I mean it.

79
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,217
Ah, good morning to you.
- I did shots.

80
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,843
Yeah, you did.

81
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,137
- Sorry I had to take off.
- Oh, God, please.

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,430
You don't need--

83
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,140
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,685
How is he?
- The same.

85
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,270
We can skip the condolences.

86
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,564
- Sure, whatever you need.

87
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,441
Aw, that's pretty.

88
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,026
- Those are John's.

89
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,654
He asked me to look after
them while he's, you know...

90
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,114
Those are his favorite.

91
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,327
Work is good.
Work is good. Work is good.

92
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,079
- Copy that.
Work is good.

93
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,872
- I've been trying
to get an angle

94
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,333
on this medical piece
for a TV special I'm producing.

95
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
- Generational medicine?

96
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,878
- Regenerative medicine.
- Sure.

97
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,630
- I read this piece
in "The Times"

98
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,799
about this little girl
who needs a new windpipe,

99
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,884
and her family's working
with this doctor in Europe

100
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,053
who's developing
artificial organs.

101
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,555
- Medical miracles?

102
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,849
- Ooh, I hate that word--
"miracle."

103
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,060
- I don't hate this guy.
- That's the doctor.

104
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,062
He's actually got
a pretty impressive CV.

105
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
He's worked
all around the world,

106
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,733
published in "The Lancet,"

107
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,735
research grants
out of Karolinska.

108
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,570
It's where they give out
the Nobel Prize.

109
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,572
- Hmm.
- And he's Italian.

110
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,240
- Mm.
Roma or Olive Garden?

111
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,825
- I don't know.

112
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,368
- So...

113
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,120
who are we today?

114
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,748
Oh.
Bina.

115
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,625
That's cute.
- So this little girl--

116
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,587
she lives in this tiny town,
Yongsan-gu.

117
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,380
- Korea?
- Yeah.

118
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,549
But she's coming to the States
for her surgery--that's her.

119
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,301
That's Hannah Warren.

120
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,262
- This is
a really good story, B.

121
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,472
- It is, right?
- Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,266
- I like it. It's...

123
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,060
it's really hopeful.

124
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:21,941
* *

125
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,964
- Yeah, this is worth
missing lunch for.

126
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,716
- Fuck off.
This guy's brilliant.

127
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,594
Did you read the material?
- I'm getting there.

128
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,138
- It's really interesting.

129
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,974
- You having trouble there?
- A little bit.

130
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,227
- I think it's this one here.
- Ah, this one, yeah.

131
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,645
Okay.
- There you go.

132
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,480
All good?
- Yeah, all good, yeah.

133
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,107
- It works.
- Awesome. Thank you.

134
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,400
- Okay, great.

135
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,653
uh, colleagues, good afternoon.

136
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,530
It's great to see

137
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,700
such a wide spectrum of fields
represented here today.

138
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,868
I only wish some
of my own lectures

139
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,704
could get crowds like this.

140
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,039
Now, I'm sure
you're all eager to hear

141
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,333
from Karolinska's
newest addition.

142
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,170
He is a professor, researcher,
and thoracic surgeon--

143
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,132
Dr. Paolo Macchiarini.

144
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,597
- Thank you, Provost Hedley.

145
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,725
I'm simply happy
that you will have me here

146
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,561
working in this
incredible institution.

147
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,358
"God breathed into Adam
the breath of life,

148
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,443
and he became man"--

149
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,028
Genesis 2:7.

150
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,031
Breath is the essence of life,

151
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,199
the one thing
that comes naturally

152
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,162
to all of us from birth--
to breathe.

153
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,123
When a patient has
a damaged trachea,

154
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,418
our options, unfortunately,
have been very limited.

155
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,381
Tracheostomies allow patients
to live, yes,

156
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,759
but with what quality of life?

157
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,720
The focus of my research
is tracheal transplants

158
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,972
with the help of stem cells--

159
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,267
"the God cells" as they
have been called recently.

160
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,479
We harvest the donor trachea
from a cadaver

161
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,065
and strip it
of the donor cells.

162
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,735
Then we reseed the organ
with the patient's stem cells,

163
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,779
preparing it for implantation.

164
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,698
I have successfully applied
this technique

165
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,283
to multiple patients
around the world--

166
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,869
most recently
to a 19-year-old patient

167
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,455
named Keziah Shorten in London.

168
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:45,001
She was diagnosed
with adenoid cystic carcinoma

169
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,961
and only had months to live.

170
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,547
Now, two months
after the operation,

171
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,300
she's healthy and happy
with her donor trachea.

172
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,261
* *

173
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,721
This is an exciting step,

174
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,599
but it is still
a very flawed process.

175
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,476
Why?
Because of the donors.

176
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,105
We always have to wait
for the perfect-size trachea.

177
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,858
So I thought,
what if we skip that step?

178
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,445
And so we did.

179
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,323
We were able to eliminate
the donors altogether

180
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,993
by developing
biosynthetic tracheas--

181
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,205
custom-designed
to fit the individual patient.

182
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,792
Using the same process,
we seed the trachea

183
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,336
with the patient's stem cells,

184
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,423
transforming it
into a living organ.

185
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,301
We have conducted swine trials
with just incredible results.

186
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,805
Look at those happy pigs.

187
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,349
And that brings us here today,

188
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,476
where I'm happy to announce

189
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,855
the final phase of our work--

190
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,693
the very first human
biosynthetic transplant

191
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:56,114
to take place
right here at Karolinska.

192
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,033
Once we conquer the trachea,

193
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,827
we'll be able to expand
our work to heart valves,

194
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,164
blood vessels,
even entire organs.

195
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,250
The potential
for this technology is endless.

196
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,504
Imagine for a moment
buying a 3D-printed organ

197
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,340
off the shelf,

198
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,092
like groceries
from a supermarket.

199
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,347
Imagine a world where
no human being will ever die

200
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,807
while waiting
for an organ donor.

201
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,352
Imagine this...

202
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,146
the future of medicine...

203
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,316
the future
that we will build together.

204
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,777
* *

205
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,153
Thank you.

206
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:48,208
* *

207
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,006
- Ah, Dr. Lasbrey,
let me introduce you.

208
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,175
- Dr. Macchiarini.
- Oh, please call me Paolo.

209
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,552
- Paolo, wonderful to meet you.
- Thank you.

210
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,554
- I've been following
your research closely,

211
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,057
since your first bronchus
transplants in Barcelona.

212
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,267
- Oh, thank you.
That's very flattering.

213
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,561
- Uh, Dr. Lasbrey's
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

214
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,979
Uh, she's been working

215
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,815
on some stem-cell-regeneration
research of her own.

216
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,400
- Oh.

217
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,360
- My focus is vascular repair--
blood vessel regeneration.

218
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,404
I've had some progress,
but I never thought

219
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,739
to recellularize
a bioartificial graft.

220
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,534
Do you build the scaffolds
to replicate the porousness

221
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,078
of real tracheal cartilage?
- Exactly.

222
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,996
- So you're basically tricking
the body

223
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,957
into thinking the implant's
already a part of you.

224
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,500
Well, I haven't really thought

225
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,003
about it that way, but, yes,
that's exactly it, yeah.

226
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,504
- It's brilliant.
- Oh.

227
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,923
- The broad applications
for technology like this--

228
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,384
- How?
H-h-how do you trick them?

229
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,011
More specifically,

230
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,847
h-how does a synthetic cell
create blood vessels,

231
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,932
uh, basal layers,
and fend off bacteria?

232
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,934
- And this is Dr. Gamelli,

233
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,228
also one
of our cardiothoracic surgeons.

234
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,897
He'll be in charge
of post-operative care

235
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,941
for any patients you bring
to Karolinska.

236
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,193
- What's up?
- Very nice to meet you.

237
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,405
Dr. Gamelli, I could walk you
through the research again,

238
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,698
if you like.

239
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,283
- That's very thoughtful
of you.

240
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,452
- Yes, well, we are hopeful
that Dr. Macchiarini's research

241
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,703
will establish Karolinska

242
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,372
as the world leader
in regenerative medicine.

243
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,375
Perhaps he'll even bring
the Nobel home.

244
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,211
- Oh, well, we're just
at the beginning of our work.

245
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,297
- But the implications
for future transplants

246
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,256
are historic.

247
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,178
- Dr. Lasbrey, would you--
would you be interested

248
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,556
in assisting on
the first transplant patient?

249
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,477
- "Interested" isn't exactly
how I'd put it.

250
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,145
- Then it's done.

251
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,356
- Oh, thank you, really.
I-I'm honored.

252
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,275
Welcome to the team.

253
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,072
- I do wonder,
as it relates to my research,

254
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,824
how are the grafts transformed
into living cells?

255
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,994
How do they come alive?

256
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,373
It's, uh...

257
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,667
it's like magic.

258
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,932
* *

259
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,397
* *

260
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,529
* *

261
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,698
- Benita.

262
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,283
- You were supposed to be here
at 3:00, Dr. Macchiarini.

263
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,286
- I'm so sorry. I was riding,
and I went over a bridge

264
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,163
that was supposed
to take me to Brooklyn,

265
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,207
when, in fact, I was already
in Brooklyn.

266
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,418
So that bridge took me
to Staten Island,

267
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,503
which was very interesting
but very far away.

268
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,297
So I'm deeply, deeply sorry
to keep you waiting.

269
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,008
- I guess picturing you
on that bike

270
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,511
crossing the Verrazzano Bridge
might be punishment enough.

271
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,389
Verrazzano Bridge is the name?

272
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,267
- Can I get you something, sir?
- Um, an espresso with sugar.

273
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,478
- Regular sugar or, um...

274
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,981
Uh, sorry.

275
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,567
Ah, oui.

276
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,946
Okay.

277
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,826
I mean, sugar is sugar,
as long as it's sweet, okay?

278
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,286
Merci beaucoup.

279
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,330
- How many languages
do you speak, Dr. Macchiarini?

280
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:19,210
- Um, one I speak okay,
six very poorly.

281
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,255
- Which one is okay?
- No one will tell me.

282
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,509
Do you bring that
everywhere you go?

283
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,888
- That is rented--
guilty pleasure.

284
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,014
- Why guilty?

285
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,265
- Do you ride?

286
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,060
- Uh, I did,
a long time ago.

287
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,562
- Well, maybe you
will ride again.

288
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,232
- As I said on the phone,

289
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,693
I'm producing a special
on regenerative medicine,

290
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,236
and I'm very interested

291
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,906
in your upcoming operation
on Hannah Warren.

292
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,158
Is this okay?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,659
- Tell me about it.

294
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,870
- She was born
with a congenital anomaly

295
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,789
called tracheal agenesis.

296
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,749
Very rare.
- Mm.

297
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,543
- Her windpipe
never fully developed,

298
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,505
so she's never been able
to breathe on her own.

299
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,300
She's never been able
to even leave the hospital.

300
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,593
It's a tragedy.

301
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,346
She's stuck in a bed,
not being able to--

302
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,057
to go outside, to play,

303
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,894
to--to run, to eat lollipops...

304
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,604
to be a kid.

305
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,066
Do you have children?

306
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,735
- I have a 9-year-old daughter.

307
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,070
- Can you imagine

308
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,823
if your daughter
never tasted a lollipop?

309
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:34,828
- No. No, I can't.
- Yeah, that's--that's Hannah.

310
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,413
Do you mind if we--

311
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,790
Should we take a walk outside?

312
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,833
- Sure.
- Yeah.

313
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,626
I think it's better, yeah.
- Okay.

314
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,379
So this is the first artificial
trachea transplant in the U.S.,

315
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,465
and you chose Chicago because
of Hannah's pediatrician?

316
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,426
- Yes. He works
at a Catholic hospital,

317
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,011
and they're funding
the operation.

318
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,221
- The Catholic Church
doesn't mind supporting

319
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,764
stem cell research?

320
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,850
- Well, actually there is, uh--
there is a high commission

321
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,769
at the Vatican involved
in stem cell research.

322
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,104
- Really?
- Yeah.

323
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,439
It's not only that.

324
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,066
They really want
to help Hannah.

325
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,111
They--they believe
she's been sent to us by God.

326
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,906
- Sent to you for a miracle?

327
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,826
Is that what you want to be
known for--performing miracles?

328
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,286
Well...

329
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,663
That sounds a little--
a little too--

330
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,292
What's the word you use here?
Um, h-hokey?

331
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,127
- Hokey, yeah.
- Hokey, yeah, sounds--

332
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,712
- Just a little hokey,
Dr. Macchiarini.

333
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,130
- Too much.
- So, even though

334
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,798
you've performed
this operation before,

335
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,675
Hannah will be the youngest
patient of yours

336
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,761
to ever receive
a biosynthetic transplant.

337
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,262
- That's correct.

338
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,805
- Does that give you pause?

339
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,433
- I've been thinking lately
that my entire career,

340
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,894
maybe even my entire life

341
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,271
has led me here...

342
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,856
to this little girl,

343
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,359
who definitely needs this
more than anyone.

344
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,527
- It's still an extremely
experimental procedure.

345
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,613
- Yeah, it is.
It's new. It's complicated.

346
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,365
It's a little controversial.

347
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,617
We have to fight really hard
to get permission

348
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,285
to operate here in the U.S.

349
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,497
But without it,
Hannah will certainly die.

350
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,667
So, if there's one chance
to save one person,

351
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,794
I think it's worth the risk.

352
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,005
- So I'm doing a story,

353
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,842
and I want Hannah's journey
to be the focus of the piece.

354
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,512
Actually, I was hoping that you
might be able to put me

355
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,348
in touch
with the Warrens directly.

356
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,934
- Okay, I'll see what I can do.
- Great.

357
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,688
All right, Doctor, it's
officially after work hours.

358
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,523
I have to go pick up
my daughter.

359
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,025
- What's her name?
- Her name is Lizzi.

360
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,026
- Lizzi.
- Mm.

361
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,361
- Well, I hope I get to hear

362
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,363
more about her
next time we meet.

363
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,615
- I hope you're on time
next time we meet.

364
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,034
Okay.

365
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:55,593
* *

366
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,729
- Huh.

367
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,733
Okay, driving car,
honking, beep, beep.

368
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,152
- Cars, uh, traffic?
Traffic! Traffic.

369
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,486
Okay, traffic.
- Okay, okay.

370
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,030
- Wait, where'd we go?

371
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,282
- Butter bread?
Toast?

372
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,825
- Peanut butter?

373
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,869
- Traffic--
traffic peanut butter!

374
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,412
- Okay, time's up.

375
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,956
- Traffic jam!
all: Oh!

376
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,000
- Traffic jam!

377
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,419
I love traffic
peanut butter, though.

378
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,921
But she was like, yes.

379
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,716
- All right, it's bedtime
for one of us.

380
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,884
- Mom.

381
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,345
- No, I gave you
an extra half hour, kiddo.

382
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,763
Come here.

383
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,973
Mom, I can't breathe.

384
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,767
- I know, but I'm gonna be
at the airport

385
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,268
when you wake up
in the morning,

386
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,770
and Laura's gonna
take you to school.

387
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,937
- Why can't Daddy just take me?

388
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,023
- 'Cause he's still
not feeling well.

389
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,983
But we're gonna go visit him
as soon as I get back.

390
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,110
I promise you, okay?

391
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,822
All right, brush, jammies,
wash, bed, please.

392
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,990
I'll be right in.

393
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,158
- Night.

394
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,452
- I'm a monster.
- Stop it.

395
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,204
How long are you gonna be
in Chicago?

396
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,538
- Too long.

397
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,749
You would think that leaving
would get easier,

398
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,292
but it does not.

399
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,630
- Well, maybe you can distract
yourself by playing doctor.

400
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,299
Oh, stop it.

401
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,385
Is he single?
- Divorced.

402
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,012
- Ah, see?
Look at you checking his stats.

403
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,348
- Don't be ridiculous.
He's a source.

404
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,225
- Not even a sexy,
charming doctor source

405
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,893
is worth getting fired over.

406
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,813
- Uh, if I can handle myself
around sexy, charming Obama,

407
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,273
I can handle myself
around sexy, charming doctor.

408
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,484
- I know, I know.
I'm just kidding.

409
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,361
both:
You don't fuck your sources.

410
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,821
- Thank you.
- Well, he's not my source.

411
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,281
So, if you need
an Italian translator,

412
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,991
just put in a good word for me.

413
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,493
- Oh.
- If it comes up naturally.

414
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,744
- If it comes up naturally.
- I'm just saying.

415
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,870
Yeah.

416
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,582
- Hey, that doesn't sound
like brushing to me.

417
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,126
- Okay, okay.

418
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,047
- How's John?

419
00:20:58,842 --> 00:20:59,801
- You know.

420
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,011
- Getting worse?

421
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,806
- I don't know
what I'm gonna do, Kim.

422
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,476
- You're a great mother, B.
Just...

423
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,271
follow your instincts.

424
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,689
- I don't think
I have instincts

425
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,899
when it comes
to something like this.

426
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,946
* *

427
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:36,504
* *

428
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,778
Svensson--scientist.

429
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,114
Macchiarini--genius.

430
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,118
Well, that is an interesting
way to say hello.

431
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,120
Hi, I'm Paolo.

432
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,580
Not so much a genius.

433
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,957
- Anders Svensson,
not so much scientist.

434
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,918
He's a little shit.

435
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,045
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you,
Dr. Macchiarini.

436
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,588
- Thank you.

437
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,049
- The whole building is--zzz--
buzzing about your arrival.

438
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,759
I'm sorry to have missed
your lecture.

439
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,719
I've been busy with my friends
here, I'm afraid--

440
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,763
a heart study.
- Yeah, yeah, not at all.

441
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,306
I'm actually very glad
to meet you.

442
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,184
I read your research
on progenitor cell functions

443
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,686
in skin regeneration--

444
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,896
very interesting.
- Thank you.

445
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,023
- So these are your friends.
- Yes.

446
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,733
- Eric, Gunnar.

447
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,569
So you give them names.
- Ah, busted!

448
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,363
Well, I...

449
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,365
I know maybe I shouldn't,

450
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,991
but sitting
in these labs all day,

451
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,202
it all quickly become numbers,
gene strains in your head.

452
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:52,539
It's easy to forget we deal
with real life and death.

453
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,000
So I name the rats.

454
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,086
So here's Mikael 7.
He's a bit of a rascal.

455
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,921
Lost his appetite.

456
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,965
- So, Doctor, um,
I'm very sorry

457
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,676
to come to you right away
with a favor, but here I am.

458
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,094
- No, uh, please.

459
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,096
- I was wondering
if you would be interested

460
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,433
in collaborating on rat trials
to test our tracheas.

461
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,393
Wow. I--

462
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,271
Ooh, I'd be honored. I--

463
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,814
But if I've heard correctly,

464
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,941
you've already completed
swine trials.

465
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,651
- Yeah,
and they went very well,

466
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,570
but, you know, the more trials,
the better.

467
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,779
- I couldn't agree more.

468
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,948
Ah, methodology is a lost art.

469
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,701
- So you will be interested
in conducting the trials?

470
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,661
Ooh-cha-cha!

471
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,204
- Absolutely.
I'd be honored.

472
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,248
- Yeah, fantastic.
Welcome to the team.

473
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,167
- Ah.

474
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:53,266
* *

475
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,268
- Hey.

476
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,561
- Hi.

477
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,024
My key card's not working.
- Mine neither.

478
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,151
- Well, the woman said
she'd be right back.

479
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,278
I don't know--I thought I'd try
to get a little work done

480
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,654
in the meantime.

481
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,615
- Gambling?
- What?

482
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,534
- Are you a gambler?
- Oh, no. No.

483
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,621
These are--these are
conversation cards.

484
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,955
- What is that?

485
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,333
- They're kind of like
conversation starters.

486
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,585
- May I?
- Yeah, yeah.

487
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,962
I...I found them
when I was young.

488
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,507
They were my grandmother's,
I think.

489
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,092
My family's a little...

490
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,720
But, uh, they're kind of my
secret weapon for interviews.

491
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,972
- Mm, they are?
both: Mm-hmm.

492
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,016
Yeah, people get nervous when
they have to answer questions.

493
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,351
- Ah, of course.

494
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,019
- And this kind of makes it
like a little game.

495
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,022
I just say, pick a card.

496
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,524
- I don't know.
I think it works.

497
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,692
- Ah, I'm sure they do.

498
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,235
Your subjects are so relaxed,

499
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,570
it's like they're
not even on camera.

500
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,905
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

501
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,658
- You are very good
on camera, you know.

502
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,243
- No, no, not at first.

503
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,577
I could use your cards.

504
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,038
- Actually, I-I did.

505
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,957
I did use one of them
on you already.

506
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,126
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

507
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,586
Mm, yeah.

508
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,928
"If you could be famous for
one thing, what would it be"?

509
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,763
- And you never answered
the question.

510
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,807
- And I'm never going to.
- Okay.

511
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,726
Well, then go ahead
and pick another card.

512
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,310
Go for it.

513
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:26,276
"Tell me a story
about your childhood fear."

514
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,986
Okay.

515
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,866
Well, life was difficult
when I was a boy.

516
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,284
My mom is Italian,

517
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,412
but I never really felt
Italian myself.

518
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,247
It was just the two of us.

519
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,957
We moved very often.

520
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,585
Spain, of course, but before
that, it was Switzerland.

521
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,503
And that was lonely.

522
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,423
That feeling,
that was my fear--

523
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:53,178
being an immigrant,
underestimated, isolated.

524
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:57,599
I held on to that feeling
for a very long time,

525
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,852
and--and I never wanted
to feel that way ever again.

526
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,940
- Miss, I'm so sorry
for the delay.

527
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,151
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

528
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,945
- Uh, miss, sorry,
could you help me, too, please?

529
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:14,115
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

530
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,534
- I thought you were gonna
say spiders or something.

531
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,869
- Mm.

532
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,209
- Yeah, here's the pink one.

533
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,296
Or should we do that?

534
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:32,884
She was, um--she was blue
when she came out.

535
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:37,972
And, uh, we, uh--we just--
we begged her.

536
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:42,018
We said, cry, baby girl, cry.

537
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,439
And, um, they were able to find
a, uh--a tiny hole

538
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,149
leading to her lungs there,

539
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:51,528
but they said she would never
leave the hospital, you know,

540
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,655
that she wouldn't survive.

541
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:57,200
So I, um--I did a, uh, uh--

542
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:00,704
I did--I did a Google search
on--on trachea surgeries,

543
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,206
and I just started
seeing more and more

544
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,834
about Dr. Macchiarini's
groundbreaking transplants--

545
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,753
you know, the Miracle Man.

546
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:15,510
So she just needs
one thing, right?

547
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:16,845
Yeah.

548
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,597
And that's a windpipe
right there.

549
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:23,018
And then everything's
going to be fine, okay?

550
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,188
- We will monitor her
for a few more days

551
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,274
while we prepare the trachea.

552
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,860
We have discussed
the details...

553
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,529
at length, the risks.

554
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,489
It is a very difficult surgery.

555
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,159
- We have tried everything.

556
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,202
You were the only one willing.

557
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,164
You were the only one
who gave us hope.

558
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,792
You are the one who will give
her a chance to live.

559
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,254
Yeah.

560
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,173
I will try my best.

561
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,883
- Believe me.
- Okay.

562
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,260
- Hmm.
- Yeah, thanks.

563
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,970
- Hmm?

564
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,722
Hello, Hannah.

565
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,516
Right?
Hmm, Hannah?

566
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,559
Hmm?

567
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,067
* *

568
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,903
I have sort of a tradition
when I travel.

569
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,279
I like to eat paella.

570
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,032
It's kind of like
a good-luck thing.

571
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,992
It reminds me of home.

572
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,495
Anyway, there's a restaurant,
a good one, close by.

573
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,829
Maybe you want to join me?

574
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,499
- Yeah.

575
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,875
- Yeah?
- That--that sounds great.

576
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,251
Hey, guys?
- Hmm?

577
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,462
- You want to join the doc
for dinner tonight?

578
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,255
- Sure, sounds good.
- Let's do it.

579
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,883
- Okay, yeah, just text me
the address.

580
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,593
- Okay.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,970
All right, let's go.

582
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:53,525
* *

583
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:26,850
* *

584
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:36,067
* *

585
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,673
- You didn't eat tonight.

586
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,842
- You were watching me eat?

587
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,136
- No, I was watching you
not eat.

588
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,015
- Is there anything I can do

589
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,100
about what is making you
so sad?

590
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,019
- How do you know I'm so sad?

591
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,897
- Anyone who's really looking
could see.

592
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,361
- It's my ex-husband, John.

593
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,112
It started with the headaches

594
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:25,784
and then the fainting
and forgetting, and...

595
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,370
and then they started throwing
around the word "terminal."

596
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,705
- Glioblastoma?
- Yeah.

597
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,207
- Is it operable?

598
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:36,586
- No, the--the tumor is
too deeply embedded in the--

599
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,672
No, it's not.

600
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:39,839
- I'm sorry.

601
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,883
- And, you know,
with our daughter...

602
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,010
- Lizzi.
- Lizzi, yeah.

603
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,887
You know, even though
we're not together,

604
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,181
it's always been
the three of us.

605
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,016
- Mm, I understand.

606
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,559
I have two children.

607
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,604
They're grown now, but when
their mother and I divorced,

608
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,314
it was difficult.

609
00:30:56,356 --> 00:31:00,235
But, you know, children are
much stronger than we think.

610
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,945
Look at Hannah.

611
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,407
- I just keep
second-guessing myself--

612
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,575
what to tell her,
if I should tell her.

613
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,160
And then I get pissed

614
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,454
because I don't want to have
to tell her anything, you know?

615
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,289
And then I think,
maybe I shouldn't,

616
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,542
because I've been
doing all of this research.

617
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,211
And, you know, 6%--

618
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,005
that's what they
keep telling us, 6%.

619
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,716
Someone's got to be
the 6%, right?

620
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,260
- Benita...

621
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,805
I have seen
far too much death...

622
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,307
sudden, expected, certain.

623
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:35,395
You know your daughter,
so you know what's best.

624
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:38,898
But to be able
to say goodbye...

625
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,650
that is a gift.

626
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:50,660
* *

627
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:19,272
- Hi.
- Hey, welcome back.

628
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,940
She's in her room.

629
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,734
Mom, you're home early!

630
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,653
- Yeah. Just for the day.
I have to go back tomorrow.

631
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,489
- Oh, my God,
so I have to tell you this,

632
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,282
'cause I was going to tell you
this last night

633
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:30,492
whenever we talked.

634
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,160
But I wanted to see
what happened today

635
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,703
so I can tell you
the whole story.

636
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,872
I can't wait to hear
all about it.

637
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,792
But first, I wanted to talk
to you about your dad.

638
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,586
- Okay.

639
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,962
- Okay.

640
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:47,258
* *

641
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,636
It's that first door up here.

642
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:56,601
* *

643
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,107
Knock, knock.

644
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,612
- Hi, sweetheart.

645
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:18,123
- Vasilyev to Orlov,
to Orlov again.

646
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,093
- You losing?
- Hey, there you are.

647
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,469
No, no, no, we're ahead.

648
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,347
Those Russian bastards,
they can't stop Zlatan.

649
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,099
- Skol.
- Cheers.

650
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,893
- Happy Hump Day happy hour!
- You're embarrassing.

651
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,232
Mm.

652
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,775
Marja?

653
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,828
You want me to ask
her out for you?

654
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,164
- No, don't--
- Hey, hey, hey.

655
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,498
It would be nice

656
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,375
for Wilma and I to have couples
for dinner.

657
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,294
- Well, I'm washing
my hair that night, so...

658
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,173
Oh.

659
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,302
- I heard you joined
Macchiarini's research team.

660
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,679
- Yes, new rat trials.

661
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,516
Uh, he, uh--uh...
- What?

662
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,352
- Well, I thought the point
of our...

663
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,978
Hump Day happy hour...

664
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,189
Is that you
don't have to talk about work.

665
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,149
- I'm a complicated man,
Anders.

666
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,447
Sorry. Apologize for that,
my language.

667
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,032
- Macchiarini.

668
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:36,618
- Yeah, his work
is exciting, no?

669
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,036
- Meh.

670
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,455
- "Meh"?

671
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,208
Your lack of interest
is decidedly uninteresting.

672
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,459
You think everyone is "meh."

673
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,419
- The science
doesn't seem sound.

674
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,213
- Well, you know,
it's not exactly

675
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,048
your kind of science--
no offense.

676
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,510
I said, no offense.

677
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,470
- I will admit I don't get it.

678
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,390
I don't understand
how a-a plastic trachea

679
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,517
can produce
its own blood supply.

680
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,602
- Well, stem cells.
- That's just it.

681
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,230
Stem cell research,
regenerative medicine--

682
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,981
it's--it's like an arms race.

683
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,443
Everybody's scrambling
for the most patents,

684
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,362
the most grants,
who can make the most money.

685
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,823
That's not how medicine works.
It's not how it should work.

686
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,574
If I wanted that world, I could
have stayed in New Jersey.

687
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:23,498
That's a penalty
every day in the week.

688
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,667
Oh, sorry, you were--
you--you were talking to me?

689
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,419
- Mm.

690
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,005
- Hey, I agree with you
on the science.

691
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:31,631
But this is the way it works.

692
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,676
Competition fuels progress.

693
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,638
- Now a lovely play,
through across...

694
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:43,101
- I-I...
Hey, oh, oh, hey!

695
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,023
All right.

696
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,066
I'm cool.

697
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:54,446
- I'm going--I'm going to make
it warm because it's cold.

698
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,699
See, it's cold.

699
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,952
Okay, Hannah, breathe.

700
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,289
Breathe in with me.

701
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,626
* *

702
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,879
You want me to check her, too?

703
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,255
Yes?

704
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:17,093
* *

705
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,095
Mm.

706
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,390
You want me to take that out?

707
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,351
Hmm? Yeah?

708
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,061
Hmm?

709
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,482
* *

710
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:33,568
We will tomorrow, yeah?

711
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,246
- Hi.

712
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,540
Uh, could I get
a glass of Malbec

713
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,417
to take up to my room, please?

714
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,127
Thanks.
- Sure.

715
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,299
- Hi.
- Hi.

716
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,884
- Is that Hannah's file?

717
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,969
- Yeah.

718
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,347
Just going through
the details again.

719
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,766
- You seem to have
a lot of rituals.

720
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:08,561
I didn't realize surgeons
were so superstitious.

721
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,772
- It's more like a prayer.

722
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,275
It doesn't matter
how many times

723
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,820
I perform these operations,
I always get nervous.

724
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,822
You think you're prepared,

725
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,532
but there can always be
something that you miss

726
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,992
that can cost a life.

727
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:25,412
- I...

728
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:28,540
cannot imagine the stress.

729
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:31,501
Someone's life in your hands...

730
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:37,132
But I have watched you
for a while now,

731
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,592
and the people around you,
your patients--

732
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,512
you really give them hope.

733
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,264
They trust you.

734
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:47,559
Maybe you should trust you.

735
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,898
* *

736
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,443
Good night, Doc.

737
00:37:56,484 --> 00:38:01,281
* *

738
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,077
* *

739
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:16,046
* *

740
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,758
- Knife.

741
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,932
* *

742
00:39:54,728 --> 00:40:01,860
* *

743
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:12,954
* *

744
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,559
* *

745
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:17,894
- Hey.

746
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,813
- She's okay?

747
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,732
* *

748
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,067
- The surgery went well.

749
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,528
Oh.

750
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,029
- There were no complications,

751
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:30,407
but she'll be asleep
for a while longer.

752
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,450
- What do we do now?

753
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,412
- Now we wait.

754
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,588
- Okay, Hannah, you're going
to give us a deep breath.

755
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,636
Another one.

756
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,518
* *

757
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,645
So how
are you feeling, then, huh?

758
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:04,441
Good!

759
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:05,692
She's feeling good.

760
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,403
We have a little present
for you.

761
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,405
Look, look.

762
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:15,035
Ah, what's that?

763
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,122
Oh, wow.

764
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,332
- Go ahead, honey.
Yeah.

765
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:23,626
* *

766
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,128
Good.

767
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,755
It tastes good, yeah?
- Oh.

768
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:29,466
She loves it.

769
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:30,759
- It tastes good.

770
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,889
* *

771
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,726
- Hey.
- Hi.

772
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,311
- Hi.

773
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:45,065
- Got some ice, huh?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

774
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:47,317
- Today was...

775
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,819
Unlike anything
I've ever seen.

776
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:51,321
I...

777
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,615
- So you're happy
with the ending of your story?

778
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:57,660
- It's hopeful, which is
what I was hoping for, yeah.

779
00:42:57,702 --> 00:43:00,580
What you did...

780
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,582
It was a miracle.

781
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,921
- I wanted to say thank you...

782
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,425
For what you said to me
the night before the operation.

783
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:16,721
Those words...

784
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:19,432
they were more important
than you could possibly know.

785
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:32,904
* *

786
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,700
Paolo, I shouldn't.

787
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:43,623
* *

788
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:23,223
* *

789
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:42,200
* *

790
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:54,254
* *
