1
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,975
- You're here
for a consultation, I see.

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,893
- They recommended
Dr. Macchiarini.

3
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,395
He's the best in the world.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,273
- These are the brave patients
who are stepping up

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,442
in the name of science.

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,403
And he is the daring doctor
who is determined

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,572
to give them that chance.

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,574
- We're shackled
by compassionate use.

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,994
- Well, that is quite an ask
to have Karolinska

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
hand you over to Russia.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,707
- I was hoping to have
Dr. Lasbrey set up

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,542
and run a lab there.

13
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,299
How could he say those things
when I feel like this?

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,551
- I could be fired
for coming to you,

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,263
breaching an ethical wall,
crossing enemy lines.

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,307
- My trials failed.

17
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,517
They were doomed to fail.

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,270
- Because they never did
any trials in the first place.

19
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,065
- The patients are the trials.

20
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,734
He's experimenting on people.

21
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:28,213
* *

22
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,104
- Hey, hey, hey!

23
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,690
* *

24
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,275
Hey, hey, hey!

25
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,652
* *

26
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,154
Hey, hey, hey!

27
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:26,331
* *

28
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,409
- What we're trying to do is a
very risky surgical procedure.

29
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,244
- Why I come
to Dr. Macchiarini.

30
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,413
He is the best in the world.

31
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,251
- There's my lovely
young patient.

32
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,795
So good to finally meet you
in person, Yesim.

33
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,422
Welcome to Karolinska.

34
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,757
This is Dr. Lasbrey.
- Hello.

35
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,301
- Dr. Gamelli,
thank you very much.

36
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,934
It really pains me
to see someone as young

37
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,603
and beautiful as you are
suffering like this.

38
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,897
But we're also very happy
that you're here with us today.

39
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,441
- Absolutely.

40
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,277
- And we're also very lucky
that the talented Dr. Lasbrey

41
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,446
is with us
for one last procedure.

42
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,322
- Where are you going,
Dr. Lasbrey?

43
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,783
- I'm headed to Russia
to set up another facility

44
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,076
for Dr. Macchiarini.

45
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,370
- My baba would ask
if you've packed a jacket.

46
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,914
- I packed two.

47
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,001
- So based on the notes
from your doctors in Turkey,

48
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,628
this all started for you
after a surgery you had

49
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,797
to address excessive sweating.

50
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,215
Is that correct?

51
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,384
- And from what we understand,
there was a tiny piece

52
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,470
of metal stuck in the machine.

53
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,639
When the oxygen was turned on,
the force shot it out

54
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,684
through your cannula tubing
into your throat,

55
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,312
and this caused severe damage
to your trachea,

56
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,522
which is where
the trach is placed now,

57
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,317
and also your lung.

58
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,943
A freak accident.

59
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,488
- And your doctors tried
a corrective graft.

60
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,656
That didn't work, right?

61
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,910
- It also hurts when I cough.

62
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,704
- We're so sorry,
really, for all of this.

63
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,707
As we discussed on the phone,
the biosynthetic tracheas

64
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,585
are still to be approved
for elective surgery.

65
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,880
So we will have to determine
if your case warrants approval

66
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,965
for compassionate use.

67
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,761
To be honest, I would have
preferred 3D digital scans

68
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,846
because with these,
it's very difficult

69
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,724
to see the extent
of the damage.

70
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,312
To assess candidacy, we need
to see it with our own eyes.

71
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,731
- What exactly does that mean?

72
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,484
- Well, after a little bit
of anesthesia,

73
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,571
we will make a tiny incision
in your abdomen,

74
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,990
run a camera inside,
and take a look.

75
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,035
That way, we can be sure
that a biosynthetic trachea

76
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,079
is a viable option for you.

77
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,708
- That is surgery?

78
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,253
Maybe I should wait
for my father.

79
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,714
- Well, it is
a very simple procedure.

80
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,425
You should be back in your
hotel by dinnertime tomorrow.

81
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,218
- That way,
we can assess the site,

82
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,720
and when your father gets here,

83
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,764
then we can all decide
on next steps together.

84
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,474
Eh?

85
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,894
- I'm telling you,
the guy doesn't like me.

86
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,606
- Bjorn is Swedish, which means
he's a little complicated.

87
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,110
- So are you saying
that he was "bjorn" that way?

88
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:46,239
* *

89
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,451
It's just every time I talk
to him, I get so "bjored."

90
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,371
- If he didn't like you,
this might be why.

91
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,206
- Look at you.

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,334
You were "bjorn" to run.

93
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,421
- I like this on you.

94
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,131
- Good, because
I am keeping it.

95
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,091
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

96
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:12,057
* *

97
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,106
- Sotnos?

98
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,609
It's Svensson.

99
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,152
He wants to meet me.

100
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,820
It's about Macchiarini.

101
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,614
- But my friends
will be here any minute.

102
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,325
- I know. I'm sorry.

103
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,827
I'll come back
as soon as I can.

104
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,998
- Should I be worried
about this Dr. Macaroni?

105
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,334
It's all you talk about.
- Absolutely not.

106
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,711
That dude's got
ridiculously hairy arms.

107
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,630
Bjorn, on the other hand, is--
- Mm.

108
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,964
You're not funny.

109
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,427
You think you're funny,
but you're not.

110
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,304
Nate.

111
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,140
* *

112
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,558
Hurry back.

113
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,774
* *

114
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,615
- The patients are the trials.

115
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,037
He's experimenting on people.

116
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,505
- I thought--but this--

117
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,388
Oh, his claims of the tracheas
regenerating blood supply,

118
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,473
epithelium in animals,
blah, blah, blah,

119
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,225
it was all made up.

120
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,394
- Jesus Christ.

121
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,855
Christopher Lyles.

122
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,816
- I'm sorry.

123
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,527
I can't imagine
what he went through.

124
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,280
- I can.

125
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,865
Your rats.

126
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,034
They all had
different causes of death--

127
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,412
suffocation,
heart attack, shock.

128
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,873
But they had one thing
in common: they all suffered.

129
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,876
Chris Lyles suffered.

130
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:07,005
We have to show this to Hedley,
all of this.

131
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,842
- Yeah, I agree.
We must inform Hedley.

132
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,637
But we cannot use
Dufort's data.

133
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,972
- What are you talking about?

134
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,849
We need as much damaging
information as possible--

135
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,393
- I crossed serious lines
by going to her,

136
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,729
breached patient
confidentiality.

137
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,398
I could get fired or worse.

138
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,526
- We need this.
- No, we don't.

139
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,071
My trials are enough.

140
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,907
* *

141
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,242
- Fine.

142
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:46,211
* *

143
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,315
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.

144
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,239
- Come in.

145
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,078
- Her pain and persistent cough
are coming from somewhere.

146
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,038
- Could be unseen damage
to the membrane

147
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,791
along her tracheal cartilage.

148
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,094
- Dr. Macchiarini?
- I see it.

149
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,345
What is she on?

150
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,139
- Standard cocktail.

151
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,598
BP's stable.

152
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,267
She's got no allergies listed.

153
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,768
- It's not the medication.

154
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,228
Check the vent quickly.

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,479
- It's not the vent.

156
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,773
- Then it must be
an air leak in her trachea.

157
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,983
- But it just--

158
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,820
There's a bleed
in her right lung.

159
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,822
I need to open up her chest.

160
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,282
- But we're not prepared.

161
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,783
- Just do it!

162
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,457
- Stat thoracotomy OR three.

163
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,208
Thoracotomy OR three.

164
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,811
- Blood's pooling
in the right lung.

165
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,231
Blood pressure, O2's dropping.

166
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,943
Oh, my God.
There's infected tissue.

167
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,656
We can't suture.

168
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
What do we do?

169
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,954
* *

170
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,917
- My report supports
our concerns, Dr. Hedley.

171
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,713
- Well, it says here these rats
died of various complications:

172
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,549
heart failure,
stroke, infection.

173
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,676
- And the one thing
in common?

174
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,052
The trachea.

175
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,346
- The results
are not definitive,

176
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,724
but we would argue
they may be enough to justify

177
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,560
running additional trials
before continued use

178
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,937
on our patients.

179
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,563
- These are
experimental treatments,

180
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,565
and they're used
to care for patients

181
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,234
with no other options.

182
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,195
I see a great deal of evidence
of positive results,

183
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,157
certainly nothing that could
be outweighed by one rat trial

184
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,954
that you yourself
defined as inconclusive.

185
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,207
Do you have any further data?

186
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,251
- Actually--

187
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,003
- No, Dr. Hedley,
not at this time.

188
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,255
- Isn't this enough?
This guy's a hack.

189
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,923
I've had a bad feeling
about him since he set foot--

190
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,301
- Dr. Hedley, we're urging you
to review the data,

191
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,429
come to your own conclusion.

192
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,596
- Sorry.

193
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,598
Hedley.

194
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,145
Right.

195
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,689
* *

196
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,441
Yep, yep.

197
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,109
Okay.

198
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,777
* *

199
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,195
Thank you, gentlemen.

200
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:04,159
We will review
your concerns internally.

201
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,495
* *

202
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,955
- What the hell was that?

203
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,498
You didn't give me a chance
to get my point across.

204
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,417
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had one.

205
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,046
- He needs all the information.
- At the expense of my career?

206
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,006
And he doesn't need
your opinion.

207
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,258
What do you expect to achieve
by making personal attacks?

208
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,969
- Well, can you blame me?
Hedley's full of shit.

209
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,637
"We'll review
your concerns internally."

210
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,931
His only priorities are
making money for Karolinska

211
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,391
and keeping money
for Karolinska.

212
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,310
- Well, we brought our
suspicions to his attention.

213
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,270
- So?
- So that's all we can do.

214
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,814
- That's not all we can do.
- That's all I can do then.

215
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,940
- You were the one who went

216
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,025
after Dufort
in the first place.

217
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,234
You're the one
who went digging.

218
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,361
What was the point
if you're not gonna use

219
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,570
everything you found?

220
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,072
- We live in two
very different worlds, Nate.

221
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,532
I have to take care
of my family.

222
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,784
- Fine.

223
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,993
You stick to your world.

224
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,536
I'll deal
with Macchiarini in mine.

225
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,921
- Ana?

226
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,049
Are you okay?
- Hey, what's wrong?

227
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,512
- He just took it out.

228
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,555
- Who took what out?

229
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,683
- Paolo.
Her lung, he just--

230
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,810
- Lung?

231
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,353
Wait.

232
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,647
Yesim Cetir?

233
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,024
But she's--

234
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,068
She's only in for a consult.

235
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,988
- It was supposed to be
a simple exploratory...

236
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:35,583
* *

237
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,257
- Hey!

238
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,050
What the hell did you do?
- Excuse me?

239
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,176
- Dr. Gamelli--

240
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,553
- Yesim Cetir,
in for a consult.

241
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,054
- Yes, that's right.

242
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,348
- Yeah, how does that end
in a fucking pneumonectomy?

243
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,184
- I saved her life.
- Are you out of your mind?

244
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,562
What was it,
a bleed, infection?

245
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,105
You could have cauterized,
controlled it.

246
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,314
- Dr. Gamelli--

247
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,524
- Run her through antibiotics,
steroids.

248
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,900
- Calm down.

249
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,110
- Not just take her fucking
lung out, God damn it!

250
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,570
- Take it easy.

251
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,071
- I guess that makes her
a perfect candidate

252
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,448
for one of your tracheas
now, huh?

253
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,657
- Dr. Gamelli.

254
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,783
- Do you have any idea what

255
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,410
those fucking slinkies
do to people?

256
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,537
- I'm sure Dr. Macchiarini
did what

257
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,747
was right for the patient.

258
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,540
- Oh, I bet you are.

259
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,292
- Careful, Nate.

260
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,127
- Dr. Gamelli, I apologize

261
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,004
if things seem confusing
to you.

262
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,130
- Don't give me that bullshit.

263
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,465
- Unfortunately,
me and my team deal

264
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,507
with very extreme cases.

265
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,967
- Yes,
just the ones extreme enough

266
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,010
that nobody will notice
when you kill them,

267
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,428
you reckless son of a bitch!

268
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,889
- That is enough!

269
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,975
Dr. Gamelli,
perhaps you should think

270
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,101
about taking some time off.

271
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,603
- Are you kidding? Me?

272
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,605
Yes, you.

273
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,273
- And I hope you show
enough self-control

274
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,318
to leave
the hospital unescorted.

275
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:55,121
* *

276
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,542
- You got anything else to add?

277
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:06,549
* *

278
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:30,990
* *

279
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,913
- Otherwise, you would have
been at great risk,

280
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,625
a risk that you
would bleed to death.

281
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,713
- I'm sorry, Dr. Macchiarini.

282
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,216
Can you say again, please?

283
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,095
- This must be a shock
for you to wake up like this,

284
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,056
but unfortunately,
we discovered several issues

285
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,350
when we went in,
existing damage

286
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,936
that we could not
have anticipated.

287
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,772
And we had to remove
your right lung.

288
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,735
This problem was always there.

289
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,903
Actually, we were very lucky
that you went critical

290
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,864
on the table
instead of at home,

291
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,658
because without immediate care,
you would have--

292
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,118
you would have certainly died.

293
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,042
I spoke to your father,
and he's on his way.

294
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,711
And regarding
your biosynthetic trachea,

295
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,671
the procedure
is already approved

296
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,591
under compassionate use.

297
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,968
I know this is frightening,

298
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,430
but this was what
we were hoping for.

299
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:42,645
* *

300
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,901
- All right.

301
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,278
Thank you, Dr. Macchiarini.

302
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,243
* *

303
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,964
- I can't believe you've
never played this before.

304
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,050
I used to play it all the time
with my little sister.

305
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,343
- Shh, doctor!

306
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,844
You're going to make me--

307
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,304
Oh, damn it!

308
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,474
Why is this game so stressful?
I don't like it.

309
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,227
Do you want to play again?

310
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,604
- Yeah.

311
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,690
- Oh, okay.
Only if you're sure.

312
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,317
- Sorry. I'm distracted.

313
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,320
I just--I can't--

314
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,572
I can't stop thinking
about what Macchiarini

315
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,241
did to that poor girl.

316
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,159
- You said the body
is resourceful,

317
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,621
that you can lose a lung,
organs, and still be okay.

318
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,832
- Yeah, you can.

319
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,667
She's young.
She's strong.

320
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,796
I just--I know
there was another way.

321
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,092
- It's your turn.

322
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,301
- Sorry.

323
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,553
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,680
- No, no, it's nothing
to apologize for.

325
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,725
Worrying about your patients is
what makes you a good doctor.

326
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:09,357
But Macchiarini, work,

327
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,484
it's all you talk about.

328
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,865
You only have one day left
on this little forced vacation.

329
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,867
Maybe you should enjoy it.

330
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,660
- I can't get my mind
off the hospital.

331
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,328
- Hmm.

332
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,706
Can't imagine why.

333
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,168
Ah!

334
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,253
Or maybe you could call
your wingman.

335
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,547
He was waiting for you
at the pub the other day

336
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,673
all by himself.

337
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,717
It was pitiful.

338
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,096
I almost felt bad enough
to sleep with him too.

339
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,435
Have you spoken to him at all?

340
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,230
- I have nothing to say to him.

341
00:19:55,236 --> 00:20:02,202
* *

342
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,847
- Welcome back.

343
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,724
- I assume Macchiarini's
halfway around the world

344
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,935
now that his work here is done.

345
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,106
You're ambitious, Ana.

346
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,108
I've always liked
that about you.

347
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,151
- I believe in our work.

348
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,862
You weren't there, Nate.
You don't know.

349
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,324
The biosynthetic trachea
was the best option for her.

350
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,368
- Good luck in Russia.

351
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,843
- Oh, be careful.
Don't pop a stitch.

352
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,636
- Hello, Dr. Gamelli.

353
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,971
This is my baba.

354
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,472
- Hi, Baba.

355
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,182
- It's Hayrullah, actually.

356
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,350
- Oh, nice.

357
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,980
You know what they say
about being an artist?

358
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,649
It's the closest thing
to immortality.

359
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,318
- I'm half the artist
my father is.

360
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,154
I'm going to teach
young students

361
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,322
about those immortals.

362
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,284
* *

363
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:28,246
- So, Yesim, your tracheostomy
has been removed,

364
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,165
and your damaged trachea
has been replaced

365
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,543
with one of Dr. Macchiarini's
biosynthetic tracheas.

366
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,338
I will keep him informed of our
progress, but moving forward,

367
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,215
I'll be on the front lines
to take good care of you.

368
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:42,844
And I will take
good care of you.

369
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:46,181
* *

370
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,558
- It's something
I do with my siblings.

371
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,561
When we make a promise,
we put our thumbs together.

372
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,021
It makes a heart.

373
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:56,483
It seals the contract forever.

374
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,568
- A promise, huh?

375
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,196
- A promise is a promise,

376
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,865
unless someone's
getting surgery.

377
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:11,081
* *

378
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:41,069
* *

379
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,532
- How is she?

380
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,867
- How the hell
do you think she is?

381
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,912
- I hope you understand.

382
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:54,374
I want to change things,
to do the right thing,

383
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,002
but the right way.

384
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,296
- It doesn't make much fucking
difference now, does it?

385
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,348
- We found her cyanotic and
unresponsive two minutes ago.

386
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,891
- Her vitals
were stable all day.

387
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,102
Last PTT, pulmonary scan
and function tests?

388
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,311
- PTT normal, pulmonary scan

389
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,771
negative for clots
of the left lung.

390
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,398
- Chest echo and cardiac labs?
- Echo and labs normal.

391
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,067
No signs of heart failure.

392
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,402
- We're pumping her
full of oxygen,

393
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,279
and her O2 stats are still low.

394
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,448
Her airway is blocked.
She can't be intubated.

395
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,575
I need ECMO support and X-ray!

396
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,785
Let's go!

397
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,204
All right, we've got
five minutes until brain death.

398
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,081
We're already 2 1/2 minutes in.

399
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,916
- Somebody contact
Dr. Macchiarini.

400
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,422
- Stop compressions.

401
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,341
Where's X-ray?
- En route, doctor.

402
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,571
- X-ray, clear.

403
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,990
- All right.
We're all set, five minutes.

404
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,825
Start the machine.

405
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,908
Mucus plugs are forming in your
airway, causing a blockage.

406
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,703
It's a side effect
from the synthetic trachea.

407
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,538
We'll need
to suction every few hours

408
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,123
to make sure
that it stays clear.

409
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,250
- Suction?
- Yes.

410
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,293
We place a catheter tube
through your nose

411
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,586
into your throat.

412
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,921
That's attached
to a vacuum in the wall

413
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,923
that'll draw out anything
that your body

414
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:10,010
can't expel on its own.

415
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,011
- Will it hurt?

416
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,598
- We'll make sure she's
as comfortable as possible.

417
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,767
- Dr. Macchiarini knows this?

418
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,102
- Yes.

419
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:22,063
I send him reports
on anything that happens here.

420
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,651
Yesim, your body
has been through a lot.

421
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,904
It is possible that we could
see some problems arise.

422
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:33,825
But whatever comes,
we'll handle it.

423
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,535
Okay?

424
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,042
Oh, hey.

425
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,626
Why classic rock?

426
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:48,173
Why not something more modern
like Bruno Mars?

427
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:57,599
- In the '60s, '70s, young
people protested against wars.

428
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,351
They questioned
their government,

429
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,561
fought for basic rights.

430
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,897
The music reflects
the same things

431
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,816
we are going through now
in Turkey.

432
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:12,238
I guess,
when I hear those old songs,

433
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,699
I don't feel so alone.

434
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,039
- Fair enough. Okay.

435
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,501
Let me know what you think.

436
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:40,475
* *

437
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,091
- You all right?

438
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:17,512
- If this is something I have
to do to get out of here,

439
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,932
I'll be okay.

440
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:24,227
- Her spleen has to be removed
because of a blocked artery,

441
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,147
but the good news is,
she can live without it.

442
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:30,775
- Why is this happening?
Is it the trachea?

443
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,988
- Her body's been
through a lot.

444
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,991
The mucus plugs--
when you struggle for oxygen,

445
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,409
well, that kind of trauma
can lead

446
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,578
to any number of complications.

447
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,339
* *

448
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,143
So what'd you think?

449
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,228
It's good shit, huh?

450
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,566
Do not light
anything on fire.

451
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,277
- I promise you nothing.

452
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,238
- Fuck.

453
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,115
Her gallbladder
is almost completely black

454
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,701
from gallstones.

455
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:31,336
* *

456
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,980
It's Whack-a-Mole.

457
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:53,733
You solve one problem,
something else pops up.

458
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,694
It's all because
of that synthetic trach.

459
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,530
Those mucus plugs
are choking her to death.

460
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,031
She's not getting
enough oxygen.

461
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,825
It's putting too much stress
on her body.

462
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,493
Her organs are shutting down,
and it's getting worse

463
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,911
with each surgery.

464
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:05,995
- We can remove the trachea.

465
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,872
- And replace it with what?

466
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,917
Even if we had the donors,
the area--it's too damaged.

467
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,545
We just need to get a handle
on these complications,

468
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,088
stabilize her.

469
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,383
She's young, strong.
She can make it through this.

470
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:25,390
* *

471
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,322
- Good morning, Dr. Gamelli.

472
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,074
- Fuck off.

473
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:50,081
* *

474
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,633
- These are the brave patients
who are stepping up

475
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,552
in the name of science.

476
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,847
And he is the daring doctor
who is determined

477
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:09,225
to give them that chance.

478
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:13,104
- Even in the face of failure,
we should keep hope alive.

479
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:19,903
* *

480
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,905
- Hold on, listen.

481
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,877
- She's losing her hair,
her vision.

482
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,754
Half of her internal organs
are gone.

483
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,757
It's all because
of that fucking trachea.

484
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,176
Where is Macchiarini?
In the U.S., Russia?

485
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,428
We send these updates--
nothing.

486
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,138
This shit is on him.

487
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,308
Why are you not
holding him accountable?

488
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,812
- Boston.

489
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,689
- What?

490
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,107
- Boston.

491
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,817
That's where I'll go next.

492
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,777
America.

493
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,321
- Boston's great.

494
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,366
- The band Boston
is playing there soon.

495
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,826
I looked it up.

496
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,495
Heaven on Earth tour.

497
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,875
- Boston in Boston.
- Boston in Boston.

498
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:27,429
* *

499
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,328
- I made her a promise.
- You promised her this?

500
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,330
- That I would
take care of her.

501
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,541
- How?
How can you take care of her?

502
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,961
How can you do anything for her
when you are too exhausted

503
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:03,298
to take care of yourself?

504
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:12,098
* *

505
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,708
- I figured CDs
are out of style,

506
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,920
so I got you an iPod.

507
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,798
I'm sorry it's not wrapped.

508
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:47,175
I put some albums on it.

509
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:50,887
"After the Gold Rush,"
"Darkness on the Edge of Town."

510
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,722
Your dad said it was cool,
so...

511
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,432
- Thank you.

512
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:26,965
* *

513
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,701
- 200 joules, clear!

514
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,668
Clear. Clear.

515
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,419
Clear.

516
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,088
Clear!

517
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:54,969
* *

518
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:09,067
- What happened?

519
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:18,993
- Your heart stopped,
but we brought you back.

520
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,329
You're okay now.

521
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,461
- Why?

522
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,008
- Abnormal impulses
can override the system.

523
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,843
- No.

524
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,763
Why did you bring me back?

525
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:55,113
* *

526
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:13,798
* *

527
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,871
There's a fistula
in her esophagus.

528
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:32,794
- What about
a two-layer closure?

529
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,171
- I've gone through all
the routine options.

530
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,423
They won't take hold
on Macchiarini's

531
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,008
biosynthetic trachea.

532
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,342
- Well, if we remove it,

533
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:41,553
she won't be able
to eat ever again.

534
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:48,560
* *

535
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,192
- Where is she?

536
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,444
- She's okay.
She just left.

537
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,029
She's getting transferred.

538
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,239
- Hey!

539
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,200
What the fuck is going on?

540
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,578
Who authorized her move?
Who the hell are you?

541
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,122
- Dr. Hedley signed
a transfer order.

542
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,041
She's going to private wing.

543
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,251
- They wanna hide me.

544
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,878
* *

545
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,421
They want to hide me.

546
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,684
- What do you want?

547
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:33,229
- Just checking out
the real estate.

548
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,832
Hm.

549
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,591
I'm a medical scientist,
so I'm not intrinsically good

550
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,636
at this bedside manner.

551
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:08,598
But being able
to express feelings,

552
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,434
it's essential.

553
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,353
Axel taught me that.

554
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:19,150
So I just came by
to see how you are.

555
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,950
- One of the first things
they teach you in med school

556
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:30,829
is never promise anything
to your patients.

557
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,748
- The gods are a fickle bunch.

558
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:40,088
- I promised I would take care
of her, and I failed.

559
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,091
- She's alive, Nate,
against all odds,

560
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,635
and we both know,
if she was anywhere else,

561
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,387
being treated by anyone else--

562
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,180
- I don't just want her alive.

563
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:53,184
I want her to live.

564
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,316
This all started
with that trachea.

565
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,652
She should have never been
opened up in the first place,

566
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,030
but now...

567
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,369
I need to get her
away from here.

568
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,997
I need to get her away from me.

569
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,463
I found a surgeon in the States
who might be able to help,

570
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,966
because... I can't.

571
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,418
...by Strider,

572
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,504
maybe a life-saving tactic.

573
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:05,215
Edwin felt he was fouled,
but Germany moving hard,

574
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,884
and they've been caught
on the counter.

575
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,928
Dahl's burned.
Gone.

576
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,596
Gonna get it down the field.

577
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:21,773
* *

578
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:28,446
- We are here today
to review the complications

579
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,157
of your patient, Yesim Cetir,

580
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,119
before she's transferred
to the United States.

581
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:39,457
- Yesim Cetir
suffered immensely.

582
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,586
And we offered her
another chance at life

583
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,964
with a biosynthetic trachea.

584
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,802
- Dr. Macchiarini
is here today.

585
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,804
I want to look nice.

586
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:55,306
- Then she was left
in the hands of others.

587
00:41:56,808 --> 00:42:00,937
I read Yesim's updated chart
and sat in horror

588
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,690
of what these doctors
put my patient through.

589
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,317
You removed her esophagus,

590
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,486
condemning her
to what kind of life?

591
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:09,946
And then you summon me here.

592
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:13,033
The issues
that arose afterwards--

593
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:15,910
blood clots,
organ failure, and infections--

594
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:19,247
are completely unrelated
to my procedure.

595
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,792
As I expanded our work
in Russia and America,

596
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:25,795
I trusted Karolinska
to care for the patients

597
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:28,506
that we have helped together.

598
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,803
I will never again
leave any of my patients

599
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,264
in the care of another, ever.

600
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:43,271
* *

601
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:00,622
- I didn't know
he was back here.

602
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,540
- Back?

603
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:04,501
He never left.

604
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,610
- Dr. Macchiarini's not coming.

605
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:36,324
- No, he's not.

606
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,917
But I spoke
with your new team in the U.S.,

607
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,461
and they're gonna take it out.

608
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:52,340
The trachea,
they're gonna take it out.

609
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:03,184
- Look at you.

610
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:09,858
You stand there,
thinking you're my savior.

611
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:12,569
- What?

612
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,654
No, I--

613
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:17,032
- What did you save?

614
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,325
What of me is left?

615
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:23,580
- I tried.

616
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,250
Yesim.

617
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,590
- I hate you.

618
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:37,135
I can't stand to look at you.

619
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:40,597
I hate you.

620
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:42,515
Do you hear me?

621
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:44,059
I hate you.

622
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:51,691
I hate everything about you.

623
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,110
You're nothing to me.

624
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,119
You're just a pair
of blue scrubs.

625
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:06,081
I can't even see anymore.

626
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:09,584
- I'm sorry.

627
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:18,593
Get the hell out.

628
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:21,012
Get out.

629
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:32,607
Toz ol.

630
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,443
Toz ol.

631
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,488
Toz ol.

632
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:41,074
Toz ol.

633
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:51,209
* *
