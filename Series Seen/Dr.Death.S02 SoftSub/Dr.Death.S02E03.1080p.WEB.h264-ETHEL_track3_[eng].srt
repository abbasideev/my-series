1
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,722
- I can handle myself around
sexy, charming doctor.

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,432
- I know, I know.
I'm just kidding.

3
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,392
both:
You don't fuck your sources.

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,311
- Hannah's gone.
She just kept getting worse.

5
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,148
- Hey, how's that piece
coming along?

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,608
- It's not.
It's supposed to be hopeful.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,985
- What about him?

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,570
Shift the focus
to him, you know?

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,114
- It could cost me
my job, my reputation,

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,782
but I think
it's worth the risk.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,534
- May I ask, is there
anything in particular

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,078
that is concerning you?
- Oh, no, not at all.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,372
I have complete faith
in your research, Doctor,

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,915
as well as my own.

15
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,209
Maybe we can build
something together

16
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,670
that will make it
all worthwhile.

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,213
- I think we can.

18
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,840
- But we need more patients.

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,885
- Then let's find
more patients.

20
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,865
* *

21
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,831
* *

22
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,168
- I was raised to believe
that if you have a chance,

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,505
even one, you should take it.

24
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,216
- These are the brave
patients who are stepping up

25
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,259
in the name of science,

26
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,512
and he is the daring doctor

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:39,391
who is determined
to give them that chance.

28
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,226
- I think Hannah...

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,502
All I need is to--
to help my patients.

30
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,131
And even in the face
of failure,

31
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,216
we should keep hope alive.

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,977
Thank you.

33
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,104
Thank you all so much
for coming tonight.

34
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,689
It really means a lot.

35
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,315
Um...

36
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,526
I think a speech
is in order.

37
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,696
And since our protagonist is
in the house,

38
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,949
Dr. Macchiarini, do you want
to come say a few words?

39
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,993
Come on!

40
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,329
Come on.

41
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,712
- You must be tired
of listening to me already.

42
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,716
Um, "A Leap of Faith" is about
the patients other doctors

43
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,593
have given up on,

44
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,929
patients like Hannah Warren.

45
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,222
Her memory is the reason

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,768
why I will never,
ever, ever give up this work.

47
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,353
She is with me.

48
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,689
She's always with me.
She's with us.

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,401
She is this beautiful angel
on my shoulder.

50
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,947
So many people think that...

51
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,951
when you're exposed to death
and suffering every day,

52
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,370
you become immune.

53
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,789
But it's quite the opposite.

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,669
Every time I lose a patient,
my heart breaks into pieces.

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,796
But luckily,

56
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:37,550
I met someone who
was able to take those pieces

57
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
and put them back together.

58
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,346
And on Christmas night,

59
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,516
when I bent my knee,
she said yes.

60
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,227
all: Aw.

61
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,813
- And, Benita,
I have to tell you,

62
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:53,817
the title of this special
is so fitting,

63
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,736
especially because
it brought us together--

64
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,780
you and me.

65
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,450
You made me whole again,
Benita.

66
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,537
You have given me the strength
to continue to give hope

67
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,080
to those who need hope

68
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,083
and to continue to try to save
those who can be saved.

69
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,502
And I thank you for that.

70
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,087
And I love you.

71
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,006
* *

72
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,217
To "A Leap of Faith,"
and to you, my love.

73
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,595
* *

74
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,101
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you. Thank you.

75
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,815
- Kim, can I talk to you?

76
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,901
Thank you so much.

77
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:42,699
* *

78
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,368
- Thank you.
Ah.

79
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,291
- Kim!
Come on.

80
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:55,837
Wait a second. That is not
how I wanted you to find out.

81
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,590
- How exactly did you
want me to find out?

82
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,008
- I don't know. I don't know,
but not like that.

83
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,926
- Yeah, seems like you've
really thought

84
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,136
this all through.

85
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,847
And I knew it!
I knew there was something.

86
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,850
You've been MIA.
You've been evasive.

87
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,478
I haven't seen
Lizzi in forever.

88
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,605
I should have just--

89
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,483
I feel so fucking stupid.
- Okay.

90
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,276
I don't want you
to think that--

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,903
- I already think it.

92
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,949
You are a mentor to half
those kids at 30 Rock.

93
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,576
They look up to you.

94
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,328
God damn it, Benita.

95
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,663
What the hell
were you thinking?

96
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,499
I never would have thought it,
not you, ever.

97
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,334
- Okay, I get it.
I get that you're pissed.

98
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,336
Believe me,
I've kicked the shit

99
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,046
out of myself about it, too.

100
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,631
I tried to deny it.

101
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:44,302
I tried so hard to stay away,
but then I just thought, why?

102
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,679
Why should I?

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,514
- Because you don't cross
those lines!

104
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,599
You don't make those mistakes!

105
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,060
- It wasn't a mistake, Kim.
I'm telling you.

106
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,064
It's not like I was just
fucking some source.

107
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,900
He's...

108
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,068
Oh, God.

109
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,362
Kim, when--whenever
I get assigned

110
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,864
some high-profile story

111
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,534
or I win some very fancy award,

112
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,578
everyone always tells me,
you really deserve it.

113
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,623
Well, then this good thing
comes into my world,

114
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,125
the real thing,

115
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,838
like, a real shot at
actually being fucking happy.

116
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,882
Don't I deserve that, too?

117
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,719
- Then why are you keeping it
a secret?

118
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,971
Why are you hiding it
from everybody?

119
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,305
From me?

120
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,890
- Wouldn't you have been
more pissed

121
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,475
if I dragged you
into all of this?

122
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,810
- No, Benita.

123
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,687
There's not
a single scenario here

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,606
where I'm not pissed...

125
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,984
and disappointed.

126
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,237
I got to go.

127
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,161
* *

128
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,221
- Okay, these are clean, and
I'm just setting them up here

129
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,931
'cause it's easier to reach.

130
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,434
- They were fine
where they were.

131
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,103
- Okay, you just let me know
where things should go,

132
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,688
and I'll move heaven
and Earth--

133
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,148
- Move heaven and Earth.

134
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,442
Just don't touch the shit
in my kitchen, okay?

135
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,277
- Okay.

136
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,654
* *

137
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,782
You need help with that bottle?
- No, I'm fine.

138
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,325
- I think that you do.
- I got it!

139
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,659
- Let me help you
with the bottle.

140
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,161
Let me--please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

141
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,372
- Do you have any idea
what you just started?

142
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,956
- The special aired, okay?

143
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,875
And we had already agreed
that after--

144
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,460
- No, no.
We did not agree to that.

145
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,628
That in there was all you.

146
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,505
You shouldn't have done it
like that.

147
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,964
- It just--

148
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,716
- My crew, my friends,
everybody that I work with,

149
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,884
all in that room--

150
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,135
- Your friends
should be happy for you.

151
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,637
- Not when they find
out like that, no.

152
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,971
You have to understand,
we were keeping

153
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,515
this quiet for a reason--
you know that.

154
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,808
- Keeping this quiet?
- Yes.

155
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,393
- Why don't you
call it what it is? Hiding.

156
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,937
- Keeping it quiet,
hiding things--

157
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,522
that's what we've
been doing for months.

158
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,648
Is that what this
relationship is to you?

159
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,108
Something to hide?
- No.

160
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,859
- Just let me know
so that I'm clear.

161
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,903
- That's not fair.
That's not what this is about.

162
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,697
It's just complicated.
- Complicated.

163
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,448
Being honest is not
complicated, Benita.

164
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,701
You could have told Kim and
your friends on Christmas Day,

165
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,993
but you chose not to.

166
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,037
You chose to put the ring
back into the box.

167
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,540
You have any idea
how humiliating that is?

168
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,292
We've been living
in this fog for months,

169
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,711
and it's suffocating.

170
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,838
And, yeah, I know I shouldn't
have done it this way.

171
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,341
But it's out.
It's done.

172
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,927
At least we can breathe.

173
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,305
You're right.

174
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,351
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm really sorry.

175
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,978
This is not about you.

176
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,482
This is--this is about my job,
my reputation,

177
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,860
everything I've been working
for my entire life,

178
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,361
my ethical code.
- Oh, my God, no.

179
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,654
I know, I know, I know.

180
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,407
You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

181
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,118
I should have not done it
this way.

182
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,874
But a wedding should be
a happy thing.

183
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,834
It should be something
to celebrate.

184
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,794
- It will be.
It will be.

185
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,548
* *

186
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,550
- You know what?
Let's take a trip.

187
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,926
- No. What?

188
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,804
- Yeah, Lizzi's
on school break, and...

189
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,391
I think it's time for you
to meet my mother.

190
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,894
- Your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,147
- You want us to go to Italy?
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:28,360
I think that a vacation
would do us good.

193
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,944
It could--

194
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,823
I don't know--
it could slow things down,

195
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,534
put your mind at ease,

196
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,953
your heart at ease.

197
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,207
This city makes people crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,500
- Let's go.

199
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,834
What do you say?

200
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,254
* *

201
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,215
- I'll think about it.

202
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,759
* *

203
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,679
Okay.

204
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,681
- I'll think about it.

205
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:04,813
* *

206
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,438
- Sorry.
This is taken.

207
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,695
- Hi.

208
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,239
- Oh, hi.
Uh, I'll have, uh, one--

209
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,117
Uh, Polar Bear, please.

210
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,161
- Okay.

211
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,621
- I'm sorry.
That's taken.

212
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,999
Sorry.

213
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,835
Oh.
Thank you.

214
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,795
You'd think the umbrella
would be white,

215
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,964
you know, because Polar Bear.

216
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,759
- You don't sense a theme?

217
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,305
- Right, right.

218
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,016
- Uh, anything to drink
for your invisible friend?

219
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,726
Real estate's
in high demand today.

220
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,020
- I'm waiting on my wingman.
- Oh.

221
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,813
- He wouldn't miss this game.

222
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,648
- I always thought
you were the wingman.

223
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,400
Are you saying...

224
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,027
I'm not the handsome one?

225
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,154
- I didn't say that.

226
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:41,284
- I'm Nate, by the way,
Nate Gamelli.

227
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,702
- I know.

228
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,704
Tab open, closed?

229
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,872
- Open.

230
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,545
- So what was the plan?

231
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,007
Sit here alone staring
at your empty stool

232
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,386
until I feel sorry enough
to take you to bed?

233
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,889
No. No, there's no plan.

234
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,644
- American men are
so much braver in the movies.

235
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,145
Hmm.

236
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,449
* *

237
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:33,795
* *

238
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,274
- Hey.

239
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,943
- Ana.
- You can't be here.

240
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,362
Uh, come, come into my office.

241
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,201
- Dr. Macchiarini is asking
what happened with your trials.

242
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,953
- We're still working on it.

243
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,873
You'll get a detailed report,
but I need time.

244
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,876
- Anders, I've reviewed all
of his previous publications.

245
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,045
He's never experienced
results like this,

246
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,756
not with his patients or
the swine trials or in England.

247
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,800
- So my trial is botched?
That's what you're implying?

248
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,761
- All I'm saying is
that any mistakes

249
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,596
could slow down our progress.

250
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,099
So can you please make
sure that doesn't happen?

251
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,483
This trial was nominal.

252
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,027
And in my opinion,
pretty damn unnecessary,

253
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,988
given the success
with the larger-animal trials.

254
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,698
And now it's a bloody bugger.

255
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,743
- A bugger?
- A problem.

256
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,120
- Mm.

257
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,207
- We both have
a lot at stake here.

258
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,501
If you find that,
for whatever reason,

259
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,211
the study is invalid,

260
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,130
that's better than setting us
all back unnecessarily.

261
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,514
How's your son?

262
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,100
- He's good.
We've seen progress lately.

263
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,643
- I'm glad to hear it.

264
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,564
I thought Sweden
was playing today?

265
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,191
- They are, but I'm too busy

266
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,444
for such an indulgence
at the moment.

267
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,030
- I read Mag Hellstrom
isn't playing.

268
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,241
- Not for
the national team, no.

269
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,993
- Yeah, they transferred him
to that tiny shit town

270
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,537
above the polar circle.

271
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,373
Now he's sitting
on the reserve bench.

272
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,460
- Ana, you're not going to end
up in the polar circle.

273
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,880
- I better not.

274
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,675
All right,
I'll leave you to it.

275
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,677
Keep me updated.

276
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:09,492
* *

277
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,135
- Ciao.
- Mama!

278
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:31,806
Oh!

279
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,148
Benita.
- Oh, Benita.

280
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,150
- Ciao.

281
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,526
- ELizzi.

282
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,237
- Lovely to meet you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

283
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,490
Your, uh...

284
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,242
Oh, yes.

285
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,411
- I love it.
- Oh, grazie, grazie.

286
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,088
- Oh, prego, prego.

287
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,801
- Whoa.

288
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,553
- Oh, wow.

289
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,391
Hey.
- This guy's got style.

290
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,060
- Lizzi, that's, um--
that's the Pope.

291
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,770
That's Pope Francis.

292
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,524
- With Paolo? What?
- Si, si.

293
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,986
He love Paolo.

294
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,323
- Uh, I'm sorry.
You know the Pope?

295
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,328
- San Luca...

296
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,248
Uh, sur--surgeon?

297
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,958
- Yeah, the patron saint
of surgeons.

298
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,209
- Si.
- Yeah.

299
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,004
- Paolo, he be
like, uh, San Luca.

300
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,548
Mm-hmm.
Si.

301
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,301
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,387
- This is so much
better than yours.

303
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,181
- Ah, mothers always know.

304
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,517
- How do you know
I do not make the food?

305
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,103
- Ah, no, no, no.
I cooking food.

306
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,438
Marco only vino.

307
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,481
- No, he has his own vineyard.
- Oh.

308
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,858
Molto bene.
- Hey, Mom.

309
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,817
- Grazie.
- Yeah?

310
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,110
- Can I try some?

311
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,653
- Just a little, tiny sip.

312
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,488
- The lips.
Just the lips.

313
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,118
Molto bene.

314
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,454
Rosa happy.

315
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,789
- Oh, si.
- Very, very happy.

316
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,625
Last time this happy,
when Paolo come back

317
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,753
after his stupido arresto.

318
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,005
- Oh, basta.
- Arresto?

319
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,340
- You got arrested?
- Si.

320
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,967
- Oh, I didn't see that
on your background check.

321
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,135
- No?
- Oh, si, si.

322
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,851
Speed limits
are just suggestions to me.

323
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,561
Let's leave it at that.
- Oh, okay.

324
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,897
So you were trying to impress
girls on your motorcycle.

325
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,107
- Girls?
What girls?

326
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,650
There's only one girl.

327
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,985
- Oh.

328
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,740
Saluti!

329
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,741
- Cheers.

330
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,786
Cheers.
- You like that, right?

331
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:09,547
* *

332
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,437
- It's like a cocoon of color.

333
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,773
- A cocoon of color--
I love that.

334
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,941
- Mm-hmm.

335
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,948
It's the perfect place
to get married.

336
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,368
- Can you imagine?
- I can.

337
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,287
- Your mother would love that.
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,706
Would you?

339
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,335
Would you love it?

340
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,837
- Are you serious?

341
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,215
- Why do you think
I brought you here?

342
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,050
- This is
a Catholic church, Paolo.

343
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,428
- I know.

344
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,267
- We're both divorced.
I'm not even Catholic.

345
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,853
- This is going to be
the last wedding

346
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,855
for both of us.

347
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,526
It should be like magic.

348
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,486
- Who would even marry us?

349
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:19,576
* *

350
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,162
The Pope.

351
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,205
- Bullshit.

352
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,207
* *

353
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,834
No way.

354
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,964
- If you want it...

355
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,133
then, yes.

356
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:41,848
* *

357
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,059
- What's so funny about me
educating you on Pixar?

358
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,560
Stop geeking, okay?

359
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,978
- You are messing with her.

360
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,899
- "Finding Chemo" is not Pixar.
It's gallows humor.

361
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,360
Dr. Macchiarini, please
tell my son to stop it.

362
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,736
- No, I'm not going
to interfere there.

363
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,780
- See? See? Doc's on my side.
Thank you.

364
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,907
- Oh, Lord save me.
I'm going to have to smack you.

365
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,117
- Come on.
- I don't mean to interrupt.

366
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,619
Hi, I'm Dr. Gamelli.

367
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,204
I will be
your post-op care physician.

368
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,288
- Hello.

369
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,623
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

370
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,208
- Ladies, I'm heading
to the cafeteria.

371
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,626
Would you like to join me
for lunch?

372
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,127
- Yes.
- Oh, we'd love to.

373
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,837
Thank you, Dr. Macchiarini.

374
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,881
You, behave.

375
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,261
- Oh, I see you're
a fellow American.

376
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,471
- Yeah.

377
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,806
Baltimore.

378
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,433
Ah, the irony--
I'm an American engineer.

379
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,102
Came all the way here
to get American-made tech

380
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,354
in my chest.
- Well, U.S. health care sucks.

381
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,648
- And my mom had to dig
into her rainy-day piggy bank

382
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,358
just to pay for this thing.

383
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,444
She keeps saying, they call it
life savings for a reason.

384
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,571
Mm.
- For what?

385
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,657
It says here, all you got's
terminal throat cancer.

386
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,326
My dad just say,
shake it off.

387
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,661
Shake it off.

388
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,663
- Well, at least you got
the Italian doctor

389
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,415
to make this trip
worth your while.

390
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,208
- What, you don't like
my miracle man?

391
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,334
- Oh, no, no.

392
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,669
You're in good hands.

393
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,046
- As long as you stay away
from the Swedish food.

394
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,340
- Ah, damn.
That fermented herring, though.

395
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,883
- Surstromming?

396
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,719
- I figured what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

397
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,847
- That will kill you.
- Got ya, Doc.

398
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,349
No Swedish fish.

399
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,476
But, uh...

400
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,478
Swedish women, though?

401
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,355
Any advice?

402
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,107
- You're talking
to the wrong guy.

403
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,694
- What, nobody?
- Well, there's one girl.

404
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,363
- Of course there's one girl.
Come on.

405
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,449
- I got shot down.

406
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,452
She told me that American men
are so much braver in movies.

407
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,663
- That just means she wants
you to yippee-ki-yay that ass.

408
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,707
Sweep her up off her feet.

409
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,043
You know, tomorrow I'm going
into a 14-hour surgery.

410
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,253
They're going to replace
half of my chest.

411
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,172
What are you doing?

412
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,218
Jack on queen.
- Yeah, I see it.

413
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,803
I see it.

414
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,681
- I'll see you
on the other side.

415
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,517
- Hey, Doc, I mean it.

416
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,437
Go see about that girl, hmm?

417
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,524
Jack on the queen.

418
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,318
I know what's
going on over here.

419
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:08,495
* *

420
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,121
- Polar Bear?

421
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,457
- Would you like to have dinner
with me?

422
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,501
- Are you asking me on a date?

423
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,336
- Yes.

424
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,504
- No.

425
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,757
- Okay.

426
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,884
Uh, in that case,
just give me a bottle

427
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,095
of whatever's most likely
to cause a blackout.

428
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:29,641
Dates are so American.

429
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:33,520
In Sweden, we like to skip
unnecessary steps.

430
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,356
* *

431
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,067
My place...

432
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,194
mm, 10:30.

433
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,864
- Yeah.

434
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,032
Okay.

435
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,870
That works.
- Okay.

436
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,498
* *

437
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:05,218
* *

438
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,782
- Oh!
And you go like this.

439
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,660
And then like that.

440
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,707
- Okay, call me anytime.

441
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,461
And ta-da.

442
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,796
- Hey, Paolo?
- Yes?

443
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,424
- What do I call you
after the wedding?

444
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,551
- Mm, what's wrong with Paolo?

445
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,261
- Too formal.

446
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:52,432
- Mm, what about Papa?

447
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,768
- Papa.
Okay.

448
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,188
Oh, bread.

449
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,445
* *

450
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,576
- Look at her.

451
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,788
I don't remember the last time
I saw her this happy.

452
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,582
- There's so much
pain behind her.

453
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:24,631
Maybe it's time
to leave that pain behind.

454
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:33,306
- What if we could continue
like this...

455
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,141
at home in Barcelona...

456
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,686
together?

457
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,646
- You want us
to move to Barcelona?

458
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,314
- It's warm and safe.

459
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,150
We don't have to lock
our doors.

460
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,903
It's an incredible place
to raise a child.

461
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,365
I know you have
your work in New York,

462
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,534
and I would never
ask you to leave it, but...

463
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:56,579
but if you wanted, maybe
we could be a family there.

464
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,081
Hmm?

465
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,833
- We've never even been
to your house before.

466
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,501
- Well, then we'll go.

467
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,587
We'll go, you see if you like
it, and then you move in...

468
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,297
with her.

469
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:10,885
* *

470
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,096
- I mean, it's free
to dream, right?

471
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:13,930
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:18,893
* *

473
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,903
- You sound better
than I expected.

474
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:32,240
There's a little fluid,
but we can clear that up.

475
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,909
Maybe your man
performs miracles after all.

476
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,037
- What, you don't call this
a miracle?

477
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,373
Polyethylene terephthalate
pipe in my chest,

478
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,499
fresh from the oven.

479
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,669
I'm a biosynthetic dude now.

480
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,046
Those ladies better watch out.

481
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,840
Oh, damn.

482
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,426
Hey, Doc, uh...

483
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,720
You do what I tell you?

484
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,139
Oh, shit.

485
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,891
I seen that smile.
No, I seen it.

486
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,476
Don't try to hide it now.

487
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,896
You did.
You got the girl.

488
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,731
- This is your fault, Chris.

489
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,483
You implanted me
with gallantry,

490
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,568
and now I have to suffer
from serious consequences.

491
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,904
You got me feeling like
a goddamn teenager again.

492
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,822
Love, Doc.

493
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,366
Trust.

494
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,826
Life is good when you believe
good things can happen.

495
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,453
You know,
when I get out of here,

496
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,955
I want to start promoting
stem-cell research.

497
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,167
It saved my life.
It's going to help save others.

498
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,587
You know, before the op, it was
one day at a time, you know.

499
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,422
But now...

500
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:33,176
it's the horizon, man,
the horizon.

501
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,845
- It's been a while since
I thought about the horizon.

502
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,389
- Well, how can you
in this place?

503
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,224
You get, like, three hours
of sunlight a day.

504
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,600
Yeah.

505
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,103
Makes me wonder how
Doc Nate Gamelli from Jersey

506
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,355
ended up here.
- Work.

507
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:48,233
- Oh, right, because people
don't get sick in America.

508
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,568
- They do.

509
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,113
They do.

510
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,157
My little sister,
she was, uh...

511
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,327
well, the only way to put it
is she was a victim.

512
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,620
- Oh.

513
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,414
- U.S. health care.

514
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,124
She had lupus.

515
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:10,463
Her symptoms dragged on for
years before diagnosis, and...

516
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:14,009
She was just a kid.
She was 17.

517
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,803
And then insurance
refused to pay, so...

518
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,680
Yeah, yeah, people get sick.

519
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,932
- Sorry, man.

520
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,642
- Mm, I had my refuge.

521
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,436
I spent hours in the garage,

522
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,647
tinkering with the engine of my
old, rusty Plymouth Barracuda.

523
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,150
Just when
I was starting to like you.

524
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,027
That was a great car.

525
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,821
- I spent so much time
under that hood, I...

526
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:38,158
I always thought that I would
become a mechanic, but...

527
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,369
lo and behold,
I swapped the screwdriver

528
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,787
for the scalpel.

529
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,289
- And now look at you,

530
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,500
tinkering with the most
intricate engine in all of us.

531
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,256
You know...

532
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,383
it seems like you spent so much
of your time working

533
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,219
on other people's hearts,
you neglected your own.

534
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,483
All right, got to go.

535
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,777
- Good game, Doc.
- I'll check in with you later.

536
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,279
- All right.
See you around.

537
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:31,544
* *

538
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,518
- I just can't believe
your mom trusted us

539
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,144
with the shopping list.
- Well, she trusted you.

540
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,813
She's smitten with you.
- Ah.

541
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,648
- No, she is.

542
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,816
Ciao.

543
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,486
- Grazie.

544
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,825
- I think we should go.

545
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,670
- What was that about?

546
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,089
- This is why I don't like
to come back to Italy.

547
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,091
You know, the medical system
is so corrupt here.

548
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,676
Everything is so corrupt.

549
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,345
You try to help people, and
they think you're their enemy.

550
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,304
- Is he Mafia?

551
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,056
- The village doctor.
- Oh.

552
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,142
- You know,
it's like Luke 4:30.

553
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,394
When Jesus returned
to His hometown,

554
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,563
an angry mob tried to throw Him
off the cliff,

555
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:35,400
but He walked right through
the crowd and went on His way.

556
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,111
- So in this scenario,
you're Jesus?

557
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,698
I walked right into that one.

558
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,991
- Yeah.

559
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:50,290
* *

560
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,418
- Show me this market.
- Uh-huh. It's right here.

561
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,419
- Ciao.

562
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,424
Benita.
- Rosa.

563
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,509
- Oh.

564
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,225
Take good care of Paolo, si?

565
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,895
- I promise.

566
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,646
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

567
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:15,815
Come on, sweetheart.

568
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:22,197
Prego, prego.

569
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,574
- Ti amo.
- Thank you.

570
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,700
- Ciao.

571
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,410
Si.

572
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,245
Ready?
- Ready.

573
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,747
- Okay.

574
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:40,882
* *

575
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:07,575
* *

576
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,044
- Sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

577
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,255
- You didn't frighten me.

578
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,298
- You look like a painting--

579
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,509
like Edgar Degas'
"Woman in Her Bath."

580
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,262
- Did Degas' woman have
a knot in her neck?

581
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,027
- What's making you so tense?

582
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,280
Nine hours on a plane.

583
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,455
- And I decided on something.

584
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,458
- Decided what?

585
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,128
- Barcelona.

586
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,965
I want to...

587
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,383
go with you.

588
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,719
I want to move there
and start a life together.

589
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,512
- Do you?
- Yeah.

590
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,726
- What about your work?

591
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,562
- I can find other work.

592
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:22,484
But us being together,
a family, happy...

593
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:25,945
That's all that matters.

594
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,740
- I'm so happy
to hear you say that.

595
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,492
So happy.

596
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,619
- But, Paolo, this would be me
taking a really big chance.

597
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,954
You know that, right?
- I know. I know. I know.

598
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,707
- Giving up my whole life,
my career,

599
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,377
taking Lizzi away from
everything she's ever known...

600
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,379
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,007
- It really terrifies me.

602
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,051
* *

603
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,512
You terrify me.

604
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,472
- Me?

605
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:53,973
Why?

606
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,767
- I need to feel
like this is what

607
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,019
I really think it is...

608
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,689
you know?

609
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,235
There's so much about you
I don't know...

610
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:08,363
about your work and...

611
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,907
your life.
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:14,577
- And there's plenty
you don't know about me, too.

613
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,454
- You feel this way
because we have been hiding

614
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,082
from the world for so long.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,418
- Always apart.

616
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,921
But when you share a roof
with a person,

617
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,423
you share everything.

618
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,883
- Then let's share everything.

619
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,176
I mean it.

620
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,722
I want to know you
better than anyone.

621
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,141
I want to know
about the Pope, and...

622
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:39,227
The work stuff.

623
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,315
The stupido arresto.

624
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,317
- The good, the bad, the ugly,
all of it.

625
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,611
- That's all I ever wanted.

626
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:55,577
* *

627
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:21,102
* *

628
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,617
- Bye.
- Bye.

629
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,660
- Bye, you guys.
Bye.

630
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:44,834
* *

631
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:56,554
Ah, I don't have
to work tomorrow.

632
00:34:56,596 --> 00:35:00,433
Cheers to 30 years
of you bitching about 30 Rock.

633
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,394
30 years?

634
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,312
Fuck you.

635
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,314
God.
- Cheers.

636
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,067
all:
Cheers.

637
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,610
- Hey.

638
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,654
- You came.

639
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,656
- You said it was important.

640
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,370
I'm sorry I wasn't there
this afternoon.

641
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,455
- You're here now.

642
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,124
Okay, okay.

643
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,334
Hagan las paces.

644
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,836
You two are such drama queens.

645
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,380
I want to hear
the big hush-hush news.

646
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,591
- Okay, okay, okay.
This is very hush-hush.

647
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,385
We're not supposed
to tell anybody,

648
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:38,680
but I never want to keep
anything from you ever again.

649
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:41,474
We found a priest
for the wedding.

650
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,852
- Mm-hmm.
We did.

651
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,604
His name is
Jorge Mario Bergoglio.

652
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,650
- Jorge Mario Ber--
- The Pope?

653
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,153
Wait,
the Jorge Mario Bergoglio?

654
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,196
- Yeah.
- As in Pope Francis?

655
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:57,115
Paolo still calls him Jorge.

656
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,450
- Wait, what?

657
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,161
- You mean the P--the Pope
is going to marry you?

658
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:02,328
- The Pope.

659
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,872
- Yeah, we've been friends
for a long time,

660
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,248
long before he was ever a pope.

661
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,875
- I mean, there are
pictures of Paolo and the Pope

662
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,752
in his mother's
fucking living room.

663
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,712
- My God.
- Wait, how does that work?

664
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,881
You walk into the Sistine
Chapel

665
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,300
with a six-pack--
Jorge, I need a favor?

666
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,885
Right?

667
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,345
- Well, basically, we were
looking for a priest, right?

668
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,347
A priest that would
marry us regardless

669
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,723
of all the complications.

670
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,934
And he offered
to do us the honors.

671
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,686
- And he has married
people before.

672
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,855
- I'm Googling this shit.
- I want to see this.

673
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,523
- She didn't even believe me
at the beginning.

674
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:31,649
- I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

675
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:32,901
She's not lying.

676
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,903
T-the Pope did
a group wedding ceremony.

677
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,031
But this--Oh, my God.
This means the dress--

678
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,908
- Has to be fit for a Pope.

679
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:42,494
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit.

680
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,287
Oh, my God, Paolo.

681
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,374
You're like the--the guy--
the guy in the beer commercial.

682
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:50,168
both: The most interesting man
in the world.

683
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,422
- We're just so glad
that you--that you're here,

684
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,091
that you're sharing this
with us.

685
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:58,760
You mean the world
to Benita, all of you.

686
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:02,347
And now you mean
the world to me.

687
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:06,726
And that is why there
is a last surprise.

688
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,144
One more.
- What?

689
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,814
- Because you just said
no more secrets, right?

690
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,733
So I want to be
the man deserving of you.

691
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,610
And although there
are certain things

692
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,612
that not even
a miracle man can do,

693
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,656
I can still learn, okay?

694
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,283
Don't judge me.
Okay.

695
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,372
- No!
- It's taken a few lessons.

696
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,708
Far from perfect, but
let's see how it goes, okay?

697
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,251
Maybe you can
give me some tips.

698
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,669
- Oh, my goodness.
- Let me try to guide you.

699
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,379
So...

700
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,549
- What?
- This guy. This fucking guy.

701
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,135
- I'm telling you--the most
interesting man in the world.

702
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,970
I don't always dance.

703
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,222
But when I do, I dance salsa.

704
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:52,814
* *

705
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,108
- I have to admit,
I am impressed.

706
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,069
You asked for it.
- Yes.

707
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,529
- Okay.
- Be gentle.

708
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,448
- You don't want to be judged.
- You're the salsa pro.

709
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,867
No, I'm sure I cannot, but--
- You cannot, I'm telling you.

710
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,661
- You can give me
all the tips, so...

711
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,329
- You're very smooth.
- Am I?

712
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,539
- Yeah.

713
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,957
- I only know this step.
This one.

714
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,083
I don't know the--
- Back and forth.

715
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,585
- Yeah, not so much.
- Right?

716
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,171
- You got it, Paolo!
- Make a spin as a couple.

717
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,214
You go to the side.
- Yeah, let's turn around.

718
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:21,843
* *

719
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,817
Okay.

720
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:50,163
* *

721
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:24,030
* *

722
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,118
- Hey.

723
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,286
Where's Chris Lyles?

724
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:32,664
- He passed away last night.

725
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:33,915
- What?

726
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,668
- I'm sorry.

727
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,211
- He was doing fine.

728
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,006
Post-op, he was fine.
- He was terminal.

729
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:44,217
- He had six months, at least.

730
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:47,053
Where's Macchiarini?
- He's out of the country.

731
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,638
- What the hell happened?

732
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,057
Were there complications
with the transplant?

733
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,226
- No.
The transplant was successful.

734
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,145
He was just sicker than
any of us expected.

735
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:57,230
- But he--he wasn't.

736
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:58,940
It must be something
to do with the trachea.

737
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:01,568
- He was terminal!

738
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,154
Nate, maybe you
should take it easy.

739
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,031
You get too attached
to your patients.

740
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,824
That won't lead anywhere good.

741
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,078
- Maybe you're too detached.

742
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,414
God knows where the hell
that will lead you.

743
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:21,421
* *

744
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,226
- Hi.
- Hi.

745
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,062
I'm so sorry.
I know it's late.

746
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,064
- No, no, come on in.
- Okay.

747
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,482
Ooh, wow.

748
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,233
- Yeah.

749
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,778
Is everything all right?
- Well, I-I don't know.

750
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,529
You tell me.

751
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,490
Was there...

752
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:51,701
Did you change
your plans for the wedding?

753
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:55,080
- No. Why?

754
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:59,167
- I, um--
I found something today.

755
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:05,924
"Pope Francis will be traveling
to South America this summer,"

756
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,301
all summer.
- And?

757
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,096
- And? Benita, on your
wedding day,

758
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,932
he's going to be
in Asunción, Paraguay,

759
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,101
not Italy, not your wedding.

760
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:17,644
- What?
No.

761
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,063
- The schedule has been out
for months.

762
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:23,108
You didn't know?

763
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,777
- No, but...

764
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,823
I mean, there has to be some
sort of explanation for this.

765
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,534
Let me--
Where's my phone?

766
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,586
- Hello.
Hi, my love.

767
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,130
I was missing you.
- Hi.

768
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:47,424
Yeah, me too.
Hey, Paolo?

769
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,801
Um, Kim is here,

770
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:53,763
and it looks like the Pope
is supposed to be traveling

771
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:56,516
through South America
during our wedding.

772
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,813
- Did you know about this?

773
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,065
- I'm so sorry
you had to find out this way.

774
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,817
- Found out what?

775
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,028
- I didn't want to tell you
until I was back in New York.

776
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:10,530
There were some complications
with the Vatican,

777
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,407
some last-minute
scheduling conflicts.

778
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,409
- Uh-huh.
Well, what does that mean?

779
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,495
- I don't want to tell
you this on the phone, okay?

780
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,622
I'm flying back
to New York tomorrow.

781
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:22,334
I'll explain everything
in person, okay?

782
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,835
Everything will be fine.

783
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,337
Trust me.
- Mm-hmm.

784
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:26,421
- Okay.
I'll see you soon.

785
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:27,839
- Okay.
- I love you.

786
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,424
- Yep.
All right.

787
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:30,717
Bye.

788
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:38,141
Yeah, I guess there is
some issue with the schedule,

789
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,185
but...

790
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:43,355
he doesn't really
sound worried, so...

791
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:47,817
You just--you just found this?
- Yeah.

792
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:50,195
- Doing what,
a-a casual confirmation

793
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,030
of the Pope's schedule?
- Look, Benita--

794
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:53,323
- No, no,
what I don't understand

795
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:56,368
is why my best friend
can't be happy for me.

796
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,536
- I wasn't trying
to find anything, okay?

797
00:42:58,578 --> 00:42:59,704
I was doing my due diligence--

798
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,289
- Okay, you know what, Kim?
I'm done.

799
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,874
I don't--I'm tired.

800
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,417
I don't want to have
this conversation tonight.

801
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:05,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

802
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,629
- Okay.
- Yeah.

803
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:11,549
- You know, we've been
through the shit together, B.

804
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:14,803
You've always had
great instincts.

805
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,888
I'm just saying...

806
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,557
maybe you should trust them.

807
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,438
* *

808
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:32,987
* *

809
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:48,253
* *

810
00:44:57,822 --> 00:45:04,746
* *

811
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,352
- Padraic.

812
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:30,063
Hey, it's Benita Alexander.

813
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:33,692
So I need you to look
into someone for me--

814
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:37,445
beyond our normal checks,
a deep dive...

815
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,906
international.

816
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:43,618
I don't think you're going
to find anything, but, um...

817
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,040
The name is Paolo Macchiarini.

818
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:53,253
