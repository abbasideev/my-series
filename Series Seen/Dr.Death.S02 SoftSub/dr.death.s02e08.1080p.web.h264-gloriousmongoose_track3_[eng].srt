1
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,762
Do you trust me?

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,516
I need to get her
away from me.

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,893
I found a surgeon
in the States who might be

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,187
<i>able to help because I can't.</i>

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,314
It's finally
fucking happening.

6
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,150
I already have a song.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,860
I picked out the first one.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,070
"May There Always Be Sunshine."

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,784
I was wary when you first
reached out to me.

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,079
Some ethical rules
are meant to be breached,

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,081
especially in service
of the truth.

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,791
Yulia sends her greetings.

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,544
She's back home
with her new trachea.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,964
Something's not right.

15
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,799
It hurts.

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,384
<i>He's killing people.</i>

17
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,761
<i>Maybe,
but at the end of the day,</i>

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,679
you don't have any proof
of what you're claiming.

19
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,470
Is somebody going
to interrogate me?

20
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,187
What's up?
- This way.

21
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,523
This way where?

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,108
What the hell is going on here?

23
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,966
Don't say a word, okay?

24
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,843
Let's go.

25
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,785
Hey.

26
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,495
You're up early.

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm meeting Aubrey.

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,623
And her dad?

29
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,666
Yeah.

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,126
Do you want me
to walk with you?

31
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,337
No.

32
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,840
Okay, well,
have a great day at school.

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,008
I love you.

34
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,676
Love you too.

35
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,765
Holy shit.

36
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,270
Holy shit.

37
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,231
A claim has been made--

38
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,525
a breach of internal confidentiality.

39
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,859
What does that even mean?

40
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,569
They're claiming
we shared privileged

41
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,946
patient information.

42
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,072
Who the hell is they?

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,366
Well, right now,
they are the police.

44
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,118
So far,
no charges have been filed.

45
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,244
But they didn't
even question us.

46
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,620
That doesn't mean they won't.

47
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,415
They held us in a fucking
police station overnight

48
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,667
over doctor-patient
confidentiality?

49
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,669
Which is a criminal act
in Sweden.

50
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,337
You could face prison time.

51
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,089
This is a joke.

52
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,511
Why are you so
goddamn breezy?

53
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,596
Because Ana is right.
This is a joke.

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,765
Our process
was beyond reproach.

55
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,018
We had permission
from the patients' families.

56
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,520
We kept names
and identifying data anonymous.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,106
They don't have
a case against us.

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,442
You don't seem to understand.

59
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,027
You're right, Nathan.

60
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,530
They just held you in a fucking
police station overnight.

61
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,949
You sent your report
to 13 board members

62
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,744
at Karolinska,
handed it over, hard copies.

63
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,620
How the hell do you think
that info landed

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,122
in the hands of the police?

65
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,958
It seems to me
Karolinska wants you silenced.

66
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,419
These are scare tactics.
Hedley tried this before.

67
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,463
They're not
just scare tactics.

68
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,965
There are real laws cited here.

69
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,134
If they want to find something
to charge you with,

70
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,177
they'll find it.

71
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,386
And we would win.

72
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,096
Even if you do win,

73
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,640
an institution like Karolinska
could tie you up

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,894
in legal battles
for decades if they have to.

75
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,397
That could bankrupt you,
destroy your reputations.

76
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,815
Where would
your careers be then?

77
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,567
Jesus Christ. This is insane.

78
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,902
Listen to me.

79
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,820
They made a show
of bringing you in.

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,615
It's very important that
you do not speak to anyone--

81
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,326
no press,
no colleagues, no one.

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,994
I'm talking to you, Nathan.

83
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,122
Fine.

84
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,375
You two will have
to hand over your passports.

85
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,668
What? No, I can't.

86
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,503
- This is insane.
- I have to go.

87
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,837
I have to go back to Russia.

88
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
What? Why?

89
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,508
Yulia Tuulik.

90
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,760
Paolo told me he performed
the surgery on her.

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,845
You can't leave right now.

92
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,597
She's sitting there
with a bloody time bomb

93
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,057
in her throat.

94
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,350
I have to get it out of her.

95
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,352
And replace it with what?

96
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,062
Another tracheostomy, something.

97
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,314
Assuming he didn't
remove a fucking lung.

98
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,692
She's healthy.
I can fix this.

99
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,361
You shouldn't be
leaving the country.

100
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
Then let them arrest me.

101
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,208
Three blocks--
three blocks, okay?

102
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,710
You're cutting it close.

103
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,128
The deadline
to print is in like--

104
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,130
Seriously, Percy.
I'm a journalist.

105
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,381
I know when
the deadline to print is.

106
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,967
Come on.
Okay, I'm two blocks.

107
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,510
Are you east side or west side?

108
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,220
- West.
- Seriously?

109
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,347
Just cross the street.
Come on.

110
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,060
Okay, I'm here.

111
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,353
I'm here. I made it.

112
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,274
You did.

113
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,901
This new source--
it better be good.

114
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,367
Hello?

115
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,743
You see this shit?

116
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,953
How can I possibly
see what you're seeing?

117
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,039
<i>This little warrant
they've sent out for us.</i>

118
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,917
"The three doctors,
after various verbal warnings,

119
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,002
"will appear
before the Karolinska board

120
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,921
to defend their findings."

121
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,506
<i>We're being summoned.</i>

122
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,466
<i>It's a fucking tribunal.</i>

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,635
After everything we uncovered,
after all the shit

124
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,553
that they put us through,
that goddamn butcher

125
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,306
is still out there cutting,
and we're the ones on trial.

126
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,391
It's not a trial.

127
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>Oh, like hell.</i>

128
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,687
Have you heard from Ana?

129
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,188
No.

130
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,193
I think they're watching me.

131
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,945
- Who?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

132
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,155
There's a car that's been
parked outside my building

133
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,740
for the last day and a half.

134
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,662
Nathan, try to,
you know, chill out.

135
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,038
Chill out?

136
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,749
Now, good night.

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,239
Hey, Burt.

138
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,701
Dr. Gamelli, how are you?

139
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,203
You know.

140
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,539
Lucky I look good in stripes.

141
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,251
Yes, I heard
about the whole ordeal.

142
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,794
Wait till you
read the report.

143
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,963
The shit he got away with,
it's nuts.

144
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:11,426
I don't need to read it
to know it was a mistake.

145
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,053
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,265
You should retract before you
make the situation any worse.

147
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,893
What situation
am I making worse?

148
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,480
We have spent our entire
careers in this institution.

149
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,483
You and I both came here
to find something better.

150
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,986
And now your actions--

151
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,114
no one will take Karolinska
seriously ever again.

152
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:37,410
Our reputation, our funding
will fade into dust.

153
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,245
You watched
Yesim Cetir wither away.

154
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,623
You saw what he did to her.
- This isn't about one patient.

155
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,125
This is about hundreds
of people's jobs,

156
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,503
all of their patients.

157
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,673
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

158
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,677
His side is our side.

159
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,221
You didn't just go
behind the back of the board.

160
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,932
You blew the whistle
on all of us.

161
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,601
You have no idea
what we found.

162
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,104
Well, it doesn't matter now.

163
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,481
You've caused an uproar.

164
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,942
Whatever your report uncovers,
whatever truth there is,

165
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,904
it's just a whisper
up against all this noise.

166
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,907
You should have
handled this another way.

167
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,829
Any other way.

168
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,321
Fuck this.

169
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,360
{\an8}Yes, of course.

170
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,278
{\an8}I'm looking for Yulia Tuulik.

171
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,199
Is that Sasha?

172
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,408
Who are you?

173
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,453
I'm a friend,
a doctor of Yulia's.

174
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,788
Is she here?

175
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,182
I was hoping
to speak with Yulia

176
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,767
about her operation.

177
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,604
If you want
to speak to Yulia,

178
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,065
you will need
a phone line to heaven.

179
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,488
I'm so sorry.

180
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,243
You seem surprised.

181
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,954
The rest of the doctors
didn't seem to care so much.

182
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,918
Was--was there any pain?

183
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,839
There's no such thing
for my Yulia.

184
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,757
My daughter was strong.

185
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,176
She'd fight and fight.

186
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,806
But that thing in her throat...

187
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,519
Would you mind
telling me what happened?

188
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,864
She had the cough,
terrible cough.

189
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,491
The things she would spit up--

190
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,787
blue stitches, blackness.

191
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,749
And her skin, it smelled.

192
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,545
Like rotting meat.

193
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,922
She would spray perfumes,
all those lotions,

194
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,385
but you could still smell it
coming from inside of her.

195
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,845
The death.

196
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,808
The trachea decayed
inside of her body.

197
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,813
She just wanted to sing to him.

198
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,316
Oh, she did sing.

199
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,567
She did.

200
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,850
I only got, like,
two hours of sleep.

201
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,351
You slept?

202
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,439
I used to love
coming to this place.

203
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,612
Sorry. Sorry.

204
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,406
I'm here.

205
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,324
Thank you.

206
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,325
Yulia?

207
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,025
<i>The allegations
against Dr. Macchiarini,</i>

208
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:47,530
as outlined in the report
dated October 4, 2014,

209
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,115
and submitted to this board

210
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,576
by doctors Gamelli,
Lasbrey, and Svensson,

211
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,329
are serious in nature.

212
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,707
At Karolinska, our reputation
speaks for itself

213
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,418
and must be above reproach.

214
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,588
As such, any claim
of scientific misconduct

215
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,632
must be evaluated
and considered

216
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,510
in the strictest
possible terms.

217
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,389
Doctors, you may proceed.

218
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,602
Did you have any specific
questions or concerns

219
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,853
about the report or--

220
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,606
More of a novel, really.

221
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,442
428 pages.

222
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,735
It's all there.

223
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,112
Most of it, anyway.

224
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,280
We actually gave you
the abridged.

225
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,285
Right.

226
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:38,873
So, to summarize,
three patients,

227
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,459
all implanted
with biosynthetic tracheas

228
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,755
that Macchiarini misrepresented
as viable for transplant

229
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,508
based on the claim
that these organs

230
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,720
had been successfully tested--
they hadn't--

231
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,764
and that the procedure itself
was grounded in science.

232
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,932
It wasn't.

233
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,600
In the case of Mr. Lyles--

234
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,938
Whose transplant
you performed, Dr. Lasbrey.

235
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,440
I assisted, yes.

236
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,735
You also assisted
at Mr. Beyenes' surgery.

237
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,112
Is that correct?
- That is correct.

238
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,282
As well as that of Ms. Cetir.

239
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,784
If we want to go
around the room,

240
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,119
I think we can agree
that all of us

241
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,954
bear some degree
of responsibility

242
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,124
for aiding and abetting
Dr. Macchiarini, no?

243
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,626
Mr. Beyenes'
successful transplant

244
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,129
was the focus
of a prominent research paper

245
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,839
published in "The Lancet"?

246
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,923
Correct.

247
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,301
Of which you, Dr. Svensson,

248
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,428
and Dr. Lasbrey
were coauthors,

249
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,181
ranked one of the ten
most important studies

250
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,641
in regenerative research.

251
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,310
That's quite the achievement.

252
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,188
Any other
rhetorical questions?

253
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,648
I find it interesting
that none of you

254
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,150
voiced your reservations

255
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,736
about Dr. Macchiarini's work
until now.

256
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,820
I did.

257
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,155
Yes, Dr. Gamelli.

258
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,824
We're all aware
of your personal misgivings

259
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,159
towards Dr. Macchiarini.

260
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,786
I doubt you're aware
of the half of it.

261
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,997
We were all led to believe
that Dr. Macchiarini's work,

262
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,084
though experimental,
was substantiated

263
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,960
in legitimate research.

264
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,338
From an outside perspective,
it may appear

265
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,883
that you chose to benefit
from Dr. Macchiarini's

266
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,052
reputation and achievements

267
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,596
until it no longer
served your interests.

268
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,848
From any perspective,
the man falsified

269
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,809
information knowingly.

270
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,688
He misrepresented delusions of
grandeur as scientific theory.

271
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,980
He lied to his patients.

272
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,191
Why are we talking
about anything else here?

273
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,194
I'm not a doctor,
so please forgive my ignorance.

274
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,697
But it's my understanding
that these patients

275
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,156
were terminally ill.

276
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,367
If there was hope,
however slight,

277
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,662
that the procedure gave them
a chance to survive,

278
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,038
what was the harm in trying?

279
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,873
Mengele felt the same way.

280
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,545
The patients agreed
to these procedures.

281
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,046
Under false pretenses.

282
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,589
They were aware
of the risks involved.

283
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,800
No, they weren't.
They couldn't have been.

284
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,218
Look, the bottom line is,

285
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,512
these were experimental
treatments approved for use

286
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,764
through compassionate care laws
in the service

287
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,725
of saving lives.

288
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,894
And how did that bottom line
work out for you, Provost?

289
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,855
It doesn't matter
if a surgery

290
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,400
is experimental or not if you
don't have ethical approval,

291
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,068
which he didn't.

292
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:16,072
The use of TGF Beta-3,
in itself, is criminal.

293
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,241
TGF Beta-3?

294
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,785
The cytokine compound
Dr. Macchiarini deployed

295
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,495
in his stem cell formulation.

296
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,081
There's a section
dedicated to it, I believe,

297
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,543
around page 140, 150?

298
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,962
- 155.
- 155.

299
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,970
Oh, my God.

300
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,432
They haven't read it.

301
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,649
You know, we really did try
to keep this professional.

302
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,318
Professional?

303
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,986
You've been accused
of violating

304
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,615
doctor-patient confidentiality,
sharing privileged information.

305
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,743
Professional
by focusing our report

306
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,996
only to include Macchiarini's
patients at Karolinska.

307
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,167
Or did you think
there were only three?

308
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:15,548
Keziah Shorten, 20 years old.

309
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,342
She died six months
after receiving

310
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,968
a cadaveric transplant
in London--

311
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,304
choked to death.

312
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,472
She's the one that Paolo used

313
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,973
to justify all
of his work here.

314
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,183
Thank you, Dr. Gamelli.

315
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,476
This is hardly the time
or the place to--

316
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,186
Then we get
into his greatest hits.

317
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:33,024
Ande Beyene, his trachea
rotted inside of him.

318
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,652
Then Christopher Lyles--
he had six months

319
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,820
to live when he arrived.

320
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,698
We cut that luxurious
prognosis in half.

321
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,077
Then Macchiarini
heads off to the U.S.,

322
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,330
where he uses these surgeries

323
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,708
to ask the FDA to give him
approval to operate

324
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,377
on Hannah Warren in Chicago.

325
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,255
You'd recognize her
from the TV.

326
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,299
She was two years old,
never left her hospital bed.

327
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,509
Are you finished?

328
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,845
No, he's not finished,
so neither am I.

329
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,347
We welcome him back
to Karolinska with open arms,

330
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,852
where he proceeds
to butcher Yesim Cetir,

331
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,353
22 years old.

332
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,190
She's in the U.S. now,
holding on to life by a thread.

333
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,651
Then the global expansion.

334
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,571
He operates
on Yulia Tuulik in Russia.

335
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,406
She had a son.

336
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,034
He watched her coughing up
rotting plastic and flesh

337
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,369
until she died last week.

338
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,038
And he got away with it.

339
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,791
He got away with it
because it took time

340
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,877
for these implants to fail.

341
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,212
He got away with it
because he promised money

342
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,382
and prestige and a Nobel.

343
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,218
He got away with it
because we let him.

344
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:48,558
It's easy for us to forget
what it's like to be a patient.

345
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,311
Imagine you're 22
with a hole in your neck,

346
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,063
or your kid can't breathe
on her own,

347
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,523
or the cancer is terminal.

348
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,984
And so you go to the doctor,
and you're just--

349
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,986
you're desperate
and vulnerable,

350
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,905
and you're just looking for
someone to tell you what to do.

351
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:06,618
And they trust us because we
take an oath to protect them.

352
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,579
Part of that includes
telling them the truth

353
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,040
because we all want to believe
a miracle is possible.

354
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,125
But he saw that
in his patients,

355
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,127
and he took advantage of it.

356
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,756
He gave them hope.

357
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,593
He sold them the promise
of a new life, and...

358
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,473
They trusted him.

359
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,893
And now they're dead.

360
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,150
The man experimented
on human beings!

361
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,446
He violated every principle
of medical ethics

362
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,157
and human decency
for which we have laws,

363
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,827
and we're all to blame.

364
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:53,623
We all could have done more,
including me.

365
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,625
But, right now, we don't
have time to soul search

366
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,961
because he's still out there
practicing medicine.

367
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,338
And so we owe it to
our patients and to ourselves

368
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,217
to hold that man accountable.

369
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,348
Otherwise, none of us deserve
to call ourselves doctors.

370
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,150
- Should we just walk?
- To yours?

371
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,902
Any fucking place but here.

372
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,613
Doctors, a word.

373
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:33,163
Look, this has certainly
gone quite a ways.

374
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,998
But there are still forks
in the road.

375
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,876
Why the fuck are you
talking in riddles?

376
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,003
Okay, look, I'm sure
you've read Dr. Macchiarini's

377
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,339
response to your report.

378
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,008
Were mistakes made?

379
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,593
Possibly.

380
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,846
But there is still a way out.

381
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:54,017
Look, papers get retracted,
diagnoses reversed,

382
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,936
inquiries withdrawn.

383
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,730
And the alternative?

384
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,109
Well, in the unlikely event
that the board chooses not

385
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,571
to press charges...

386
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,656
without the support
of the institution,

387
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,075
without funding,

388
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,911
do you understand what would
happen to your careers?

389
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,496
It's up to you.

390
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,842
<i>I wanted to be
a fighter pilot.</i>

391
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,260
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,930
I felt a need,
a need for speed.

393
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,059
I wanted a bakeshop.

394
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,268
Do you bake?

395
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,728
No, no.

396
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,230
Not me, my ex.

397
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,899
She would make--oh, the things.

398
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,734
The things,
what do you call them?

399
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,446
She made rhubarb,
passionfruit, matcha.

400
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,407
Oh, fuck,
what do you call them?

401
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,827
Anyway, she would bake,
and I would manage,

402
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:54,661
whatever that means.

403
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,539
But as fate would have it,

404
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,001
"Ana Lasbrey,
welcome to Oxford."

405
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,003
I wanted to be a rock star.

406
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,754
both: We know.

407
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,592
Mm.

408
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,680
Macarons,
that's what they're called.

409
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,808
- Ah.
- Oh, so delicious.

410
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,351
I should call her.

411
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,146
Uh... I don't think
you should call her.

412
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,524
No?

413
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,317
And at the end of the day,

414
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,861
what was the point
of any of it?

415
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,200
Oxford,
residencies, internships,

416
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,538
scholarships, student loans,
fucking ramen for breakfast--

417
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,708
I mean, it is, objectively,
a miserable line of work,

418
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,501
and yet--

419
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,170
It's impossible not
to wonder what it says

420
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,964
about us to choose it.

421
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:51,843
The anxiety,
the 48-hour shifts,

422
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,763
the utter absence
of a social life.

423
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:57,057
Ah, yes, but look at us now,

424
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:00,602
on the right side of history,
a clear conscience,

425
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,229
and so extremely unemployed.

426
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,611
What? Shelabetsh--

427
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,280
- Albet--
- De arbetslosa.

428
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,990
The arbetslosa.

429
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,661
Oh, fuck.

430
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,790
Why is it so hard
to do the right thing?

431
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,174
Where are you going?

432
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,718
Home, to pack.

433
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:37,180
There's nothing
keeping me here, is there?

434
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,890
Anyway...

435
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,061
It's not like I ever want
to see you people again.

436
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,021
Nonsense, you love us.

437
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,610
You know, it's funny.

438
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,571
I was wondering when one
of us was gonna ask.

439
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,532
Ask what?

440
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,701
Where the fuck
is Macchiarini?

441
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,986
Maybe English is easier.

442
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,365
I wasn't aware we had
an operation scheduled.

443
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,702
Da, I'm implanting
a biosynthetic trachea today.

444
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,579
But I haven't prepared--

445
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,789
I prepared
the trachea myself.

446
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,417
I need you to keep working
on the catalog expansion,

447
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,419
the new organs.

448
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,130
Of course,
the work is happening.

449
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,551
But I thought we might wait
after Miss Yulia.

450
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:05,060
We're falling
behind schedule.

451
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,436
We need a breakthrough
if we want

452
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,146
to secure additional funding.

453
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,151
There is a German TV crew
filming a special here.

454
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,570
When the world sees
what we're doing--

455
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,864
"Miracles."

456
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,407
Exactly.

457
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,992
Miracles.

458
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,498
Don't you have work
to complete?

459
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,458
Yes, sir. Of course.

460
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,476
So imagine if, instead
of waiting for months or years

461
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,187
for someone to donate an organ,
you go to the supermarket

462
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,064
and say,
hey, can I have a new liver?

463
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,816
- Incredible.
- Yeah.

464
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,318
It's never been done before.
It's the future.

465
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,113
So you are creating
new body parts?

466
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,239
Yes.

467
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,241
Yeah, yeah,
like Dr. Frankenstein.

468
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,617
Or God.

469
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:08,748
So...

470
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,846
So-so-so from here to there?

471
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,097
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

472
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,266
Okay.

473
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,480
<i>The work I do is not easy.</i>

474
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,107
<i>Innovation is never easy.</i>

475
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,317
<i>But I do believe
that we don't evolve</i>

476
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,694
<i>from a place of comfort.</i>

477
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,988
Maybe the Earth is not
the center of the universe.

478
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,740
Maybe disease
is caused by germs.

479
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,075
Those were
revolutionary ideas once.

480
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:47,454
I want to change
the way we think about how

481
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,414
we repair the human body.

482
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,124
That's how we change the world.

483
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,502
And what inspired
such a revolutionary piece

484
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,879
of technology?

485
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,005
I don't know.

486
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,966
But when I look at it--

487
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,344
this was the first model.

488
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,804
Do you see?

489
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,057
It's a cross.

490
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:10,060
You actually suffocate
when you're crucified.

491
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,353
Not many people know this.

492
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,607
But without air,
we're just dust.

493
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:21,321
And maybe this is its purpose,
my purpose, the will of God.

494
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,948
You believe
you were divinely inspired?

495
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,742
No, no, no.

496
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:29,120
No, but I do keep
my faith in mind.

497
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,164
So you are a religious man?

498
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,290
Yes, I am.

499
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,377
You know, the Pope
has these red shoes,

500
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:40,006
and I also have a pair of red
shoes that I wear in surgery.

501
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,676
They were a gift
from my mother.

502
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,928
Your mother must
be very proud.

503
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,808
Yeah, I think so.

504
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:53,770
She keeps a portrait
of San Luca in her house,

505
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,106
you know,
the patron saint of surgeons.

506
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,900
Surgeons, bachelors,
and butchers, correct?

507
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:03,822
You mentioned earlier
that your work wasn't easy.

508
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,283
This medicine,
I hold it on my shoulders.

509
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,786
I have to keep pushing it
up the mountain.

510
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,913
Some mornings,
I wake up in my hotel

511
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,581
all alone, away from my family.

512
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,625
In fact, I spend most
of my year like that.

513
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,169
And this can be difficult--
sleeping in hotels,

514
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,755
on pillows that never
feel quite--you know?

515
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,382
My patients are my priority.

516
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,509
Room service for dinner,
sometimes just the minibar.

517
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,969
Maybe there's a movie on TV

518
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,429
in a language that I know,
maybe not.

519
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,556
Sometimes I wake up alone,
and I don't know where I am.

520
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,850
This could change the world.
<i>The will of God.</i>

521
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,560
And it's difficult.
It's difficult.

522
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,644
It's difficult.

523
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:35,812
It is truly difficult,

524
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,440
and no one truly
understands that, no one.

525
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:56,750
But, to answer your question,
the work I do--

526
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,460
is it easy?

527
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,919
No, it's not.

528
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,963
But to save someone's life--

529
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,758
that is my purpose.

530
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,716
{\an8}Oh.

531
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,710
So what do you think?

532
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,047
Suspensions, licenses revoked,
death penalty?

533
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:59,761
I think there's a possibility
I may still be intoxicated.

534
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,264
You guys see
the news vans outside?

535
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,433
What vans?

536
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,155
Something's different.

537
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,327
Who is that?

538
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:25,870
That's Ebba Blomberg.

539
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,748
She runs--
- The Swedish Research Council.

540
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,917
All right,
as many of you already know,

541
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,128
the report that is the focus
of this hearing

542
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:35,505
has been leaked,
and an article referencing

543
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:39,759
its contents was published
this morning to public outlets.

544
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,761
Due to the increased
public attention,

545
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,638
the Karolinska board
has decided

546
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:46,266
to hand the investigation
over to a third party.

547
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:50,270
Ms. Blomberg and
the Swedish Research Council

548
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,315
will assume charge
of the review from here.

549
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,651
Let's please begin.

550
00:37:56,651 --> 00:38:00,071
Let's please turn to page 143.

551
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:03,283
143.

552
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,452
There was a question
about the shift

553
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:09,414
from POSS-PCU
to pure PET materials

554
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:12,667
without additional
testing in place.

555
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,844
{\an8}Perhaps I am
still intoxicated.

556
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,846
{\an8}What the hell was that?
Our report was leaked?

557
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,432
{\an8}Did he say leaked?
- What does this mean?

558
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,600
Oh, my God.

559
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:32,604
"Love, Lies,
and Human Experimentation:

561
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,485
Listen to this, near the end.

562
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,279
"Macchiarini has been
credibly accused by a group

563
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,198

571
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:05,220
Oh, my fucking God.

572
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,263
The news vans out front.

573
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,224
Outlets are picking this up.

574
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,475
American outlets.

575
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,727
Sweden is pissed.

576
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,063
Well, that's it.

577
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,439
You saw them in there.

578
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:19,442
Karolinska can't stand
behind him anymore.

579
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,652
Did we do it?

580
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,654
It seems this woman did it.

581
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:26,616
Who the hell
is Benita Alexander?

582
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,832
"The Pope?"
Sorry, it's all caps.

583
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,584
"The Pope?
She seriously believed that?

584
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,128
What a fucking idiot."

585
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:39,504
I mean, it's fair.

586
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:41,506
Hold on, hold on.
This one's good.

587
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,258
"Was this bitch drunk
or something?"

588
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,760
- Uh, you think?
- Yeah, you were.

589
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,762
And a little crazy.
- Drunk and crazy.

590
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,305
We all got to be
something, right?

591
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,683
Yeah.
Oh, what about this one?

592
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,352
"How could she let that man

593
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:56,438

594
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,442
- All right, you know--
- No, no, no, no, no.

595
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:01,651
I'm not even...

596
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:06,281
Have you heard back
from Lawrence?

597
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,408
Oh, no.

598
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,368
I mean, yes, I did.

599
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:11,953
It was a no.

600
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,955
Oh.

601
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,374
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,752
God, you would have been
perfect for that job.

603
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,379
Yeah, they're all
gonna be no, Kim.

604
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,798
- What do you mean?
- I'm un-hirable.

605
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,925
- Oh, stop it.
- It's true.

606
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,136
Turns out no one wants
to hire a reporter

607
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:29,971
who slept with their subject,

608
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:32,640
especially when that subject
turned out to be a con man.

609
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,642
Oh, well,
you know the golden rule.

610
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,895
both:
You don't fuck your sources.

611
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,980
Right, they should put me
on the poster.

612
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,106
Yep.

614
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,781
I mean, I knew
it was going to be hard.

615
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:53,453
But some of this,
I just didn't expect.

616
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,997
You getting
symptoms of regret?

617
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,585
I'm having symptoms
of wondering

618
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,171
whether it was worth it,
whether any of this

619
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:05,340
is ever worth it, you know?

620
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,966
Put yourself out there.

621
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,551
Tell the truth.

622
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,013
Fuck.

623
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:15,892
Why is it so hard
to do the right thing?

624
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,395
But you did.

625
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:22,899
We'll see.

626
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,160
Hello?

627
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,121
Yes, this is he.

628
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,671
I see.

629
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:51,136
Thanks.

630
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:53,555
Thank you for calling.

631
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:44,147
Do you know what
you want for dinner?

632
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,648
Whatever.

633
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,152
What did you think
about the article?

634
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,785
There's no point in pretending.

635
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,578
It's on the internet.

636
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:04,250
You should see what
people are saying.

637
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,004
I know what they're saying.

638
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:12,842
I believed him too.

639
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:22,602
I have been trying
really hard to figure out

640
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:26,523
how to explain all
of this to you,

641
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:29,192
what was real, why he lied.

642
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:33,655
But I just don't think
we're ever going to know,

643
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:36,032
and we have to be okay
with that.

644
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:40,620
But it doesn't even matter
because as long

645
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,083
as I have you, kiddo, I'm good.

646
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:51,339
People can say
whatever they want.

647
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:53,508
You kinda kicked his ass.

648
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:56,302
We did, didn't we?

649
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,388
Yeah.

650
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:00,140
I'm proud of you.

651
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:10,108
I love you.

652
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,068
I love you too.

653
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,955
- Benita?
- Allison?

654
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:25,290
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.

655
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,875
Sit, please.

656
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,418
Thank you for meeting me.

657
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,128
Yeah, of course.

658
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,839
Your message was
a little vague.

659
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,592
What can I do for you?

660
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,222
I'm an ad exec at IPG--
a good one.

661
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,183
I read people.

662
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:46,811
I can tell the public what they
want before they even know it.

663
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,064
Then I give it to them.

664
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:53,651
And six months ago,
I was conned

665
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,945
by my fiancé--

666
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,906
former.

667
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:01,117
It was like this fog
all around my head

668
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:05,830
just wrapping up the truth and
the lies until it all just--

669
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,959
I didn't have anyone
to talk to, be honest with.

670
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:13,672
And then I read your article.

671
00:45:15,131 --> 00:45:17,634
You just told it.

672
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:20,720
You put it out there,
haters be damned.

673
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,642
Well, there
certainly are haters.

674
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,769
Who gives a shit?

675
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:29,729
You're owning your story.

676
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:37,612
When I read it,
it just made me feel...

677
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:39,989
seen, I guess.

678
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,286
Well,
if it could happen to you,

679
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,913
and it happened to me,
at least we're not

680
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:49,457
the only ones, right?

681
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:51,292
Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,589
Actually,
would you be interested

683
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:58,758
in me telling your story?

684
00:45:58,758 --> 00:46:00,844
Yeah.

685
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,721
All right, yeah.

686
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:04,305
Yeah?

687
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:06,516
Yeah.

688
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:08,560
Is it okay if I record this?

689
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,353
Sure.

690
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,147
Okay.

691
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:16,359
All right, so...

692
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,208
{\an8}Crowds have gathered today
to hear

693
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,461
{\an8}the verdict of the Swedish
Police investigation

694
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,422
{\an8}into celebrity surgeon
Paolo Macchiarini,

695
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:39,924
who has been accused
of medical misconduct.

696
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:41,926
Officials are hoping
for an indictment

697
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:43,678
to be issued today in the case

698
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:47,098
that has taken the global
medical community by storm.

699
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,286
My daughter.

700
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,208
I'm so sorry.

701
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,148
Hello.

702
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:22,318
After months of investigations
and deliberations,

703
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,988
we, along with
the Prosecutor General,

704
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,532
are prepared
to announce our findings.

705
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:30,535
We have found that there was
a clear and real

706
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:33,329
scientific misconduct
that took place--

707
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:37,042
negligence
and surgical misadventures--

708
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:40,879
during Dr. Macchiarini's
tenure here in Sweden.

709
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:47,802
However, we do not
have the grounds

710
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:52,098
to charge Dr. Paolo Macchiarini
with any criminal conduct.

711
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:59,939
In our conclusion,
in terms of the criminal law,

712
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:02,984
there are no grounds
for legal liability.

713
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,157
This investigation
has now been closed.

714
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,042
It's Wednesday.

715
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,877
Hump day happy hour?

716
00:49:20,877 --> 00:49:23,755
First pint's on me.

717
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:25,048
What about the second?

718
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,424
The second is on you.

719
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:28,259
I can't get it.
I can't afford it.

720
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:30,720
The fifth is on me.

721
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:12,012
"I'll be back."
It must be, it must be.

722
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,805
I don't know, man.

723
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:15,390
What do you think it is?

724
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,808
Yippee kayak, motherfucker?

725
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,518
Yippee ki-yay.

726
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:20,270
He's very serious
about these things.

727
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,438
Please don't get him started.

728
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,856
- I'm with you.
- No, no, no.

729
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,065
Don't argue on this with me.

730
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,358
Sure.

731
00:50:35,076 --> 00:50:36,494
He didn't win.

732
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:37,954
Not really.

733
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:39,164
No?

734
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:43,293
I'm glad we did it, though.

735
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:45,670
Me too.

736
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,255
Yeah.

737
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:50,425
But if you could go back,
if you found a DeLorean

738
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,927
right now,
would you do it again?

739
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,846
Oh, absolutely fucking not.

740
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:59,100
But that's the thing.

741
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,519
Science is not perfect, right?

742
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,645
Far from it.

743
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:03,980
But, for some reason,
we think that

744
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,607
the medical system can be.

745
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:08,318
And we can't fight the system
because we're all a part of it.

746
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,987
So I suppose all
we can do is this:

747
00:51:10,987 --> 00:51:13,031
fight for it.

748
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,203
And that's why
you stayed, right?

749
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:22,082
I guess you're right.

750
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,585
Aw, well,
that is lovely, Dr. Svensson.

751
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:27,170
Such a sap.

752
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,546
I really--I can't with this.

753
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:30,173
Where do you think
I get it from?

754
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:31,383
Who, me?

755
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,301
- "We owe it to our patients"...
- No.

756
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:37,013
"And ourselves to hold
that man accountable."

757
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:40,058
both: "Otherwise,
none of us deserve

758
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:41,768
to call ourselves doctors."

759
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:42,977
Come on. All right.

760
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:49,442
You know, there is something
that's been bugging me.

761
00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:51,820
We were so careful.

762
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,740
Fucking hard copies--
who the hell leaked the report?

763
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,701
I suppose we'll never know.

764
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:01,579
Let's just be thankful
that someone did.

765
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,419
<i>- Skol.
- Skol.</i>

766
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:08,586
Skol.
both: <i>Skol.</i>
