1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>All I can hope is</i>

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,055
when you walk out
of that church,

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,016
when you listen
to those bells ringing,

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,225
<i>that you will be happy.</i>

5
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>Hi, my love.</i>

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>I'm here missing you
in Barcelona.</i>

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,522
<i>The lemon trees
are ready for you.</i>

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,690
- Hey, Paolo?
- Yeah?

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,734
What do I call you
after the wedding?

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,694
What about Papa?

11
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,279
Papa. OK.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,156
You want us to move
to Barcelona?

13
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,742
It's an incredible place
to raise a child.

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,577
Paolo was arraigned
for extortion.

15
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,121
This guy--
this guy was in Italy.

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,622
<i>Why me, Paolo?</i>

17
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,291
You don't want to go
digging in there, Benita,

18
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,375
because it's dangerous.

19
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,085
You need to leave.

20
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,256
Yulia, my dear,
for you, only the best.

21
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,258
So this is an
elective surgery.

22
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,344
- Yeah.
- Oh.

23
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,221
This grant has everything.
It's all based on a lie--

24
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>the patients are, the trials--</i>

25
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>he's experimenting on people.</i>

26
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,727
He just took it out.

27
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,396
The issues
that arose afterwards

28
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,816
are completely unrelated
to my procedure.

29
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,716
<i>Gentlemen,
welcome to Krasnodar,</i>

30
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,344
{\an8}<i>the world's
premier destination</i>

31
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,971
{\an8}<i>for the most
cutting-edge procedures</i>

32
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,641
{\an8}<i>in regenerative medicine.</i>

33
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>Today, we will show you
what we have built</i>

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,356
<i>this past year under
the leadership of Dr. Lasbrey.</i>

35
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,858
We realize that the delays
have been trying,

36
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,653
but the results we've seen
are revolutionary.

37
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,281
The upcoming patient trials
are the final step

38
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,701
before full medical approval.

39
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,869
These are young,
healthy adults

40
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,123
who are electing to be
a part of the future.

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,208
In just a few days,
we will perform

42
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,460
our very first procedure
on a young woman

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,921
named Yulia Tuulik.

44
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,967
In Karolinska,
we operated to save lives.

45
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,722
Here in Krasnodar, we will
operate to improve lives.

46
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,641
And now, I leave you
with Dr. Lasbrey,

47
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,727
who is going to show you
around our facilities.

48
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,979
Thank you.

49
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,814
Right this way.

50
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,443
In tandem with
the trachea transplantations,

51
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,155
we've made significant headway
in our expanded research.

52
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,781
We've just entered
the testing phase

53
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,827
for our next biosynthetic
organ, the diaphragm.

54
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,001
Vasia, Mila, may we interrupt?

55
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,420
- Ana.
- Welcome back.

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,005
It's good to be back.

57
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,008
How was Sweden?

58
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,718
Are they all dead?

59
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,304
What?

60
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,307
No, no, they're anesthetized.

61
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,476
They cannot feel a thing.

62
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,812
If it seems cruel,
that's because it is.

63
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,279
We began with the trachea.

64
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,615
Now we've made headway
with the diaphragm,

65
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,283
a much more complex organ.

66
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,952
But these were
just the beginning.

67
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,289
Next, we conquer the liver,
the lungs,

68
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,916
the heart.

69
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,377
Dr. Lasbrey,
we have waited longer

70
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,837
than we wished for progress.

71
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,591
But this facility
does not disappoint.

72
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,527
- Knock, knock.
- Ah, it's you.

73
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,237
Can you believe it?

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,365
It's finally fucking happening.

75
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,742
No more silk chokers for you.

76
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
Ah, I'll be able
to fucking shower.

77
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,496
What, you don't like
Andrej's bubble baths?

78
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,542
This is going to make
everything right.

79
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,544
We have one last hard part.

80
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,796
Are you ready?
- I am.

81
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,589
Are you going to tell me
what you're doing back there?

82
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,842
Or are you going to make me
guess, like my husband?

83
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,929
Well, this is technically the
first part of your procedure.

84
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,890
We're going to extract
bone marrow from your hip,

85
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,102
separate the stem cells
from the bone marrow.

86
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,148
Then later, I'll give your
new trachea a nice bath

87
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,483
with the stem cells.

88
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,568
Thank you.

89
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,195
Well, don't thank me yet.

90
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,655
This will be
a bit uncomfortable.

91
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,657
I mean it. <i>Spasibo.</i>

92
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,327
Tiny prick.

93
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,709
You're going to feel
a series of pinches.

94
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,294
OK.

95
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,060
How was your trip
from Saint Petersburg?

96
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,648
I sat next to a big fat guy.

97
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,108
Andrej's not that fat.

98
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,486
Ow.

99
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,154
Aisle or window?

100
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,697
Window.

101
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,158
I watched the country pass by.

102
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,618
You doing OK?

103
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,911
This is nothing.

104
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,372
Really?

105
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,209
When I was in my car crash,
I was pregnant with Sasha.

106
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,670
They had to re-break my bones,

107
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,506
pick my teeth up
from the street.

108
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,508
My whole body was broken,

109
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,593
but that little boy survived.

110
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,345
After that, I--

111
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,014
I promised
I would keep him safe.

112
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,557
Through all the surgeries,

113
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,309
I never took the painkillers.

114
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,023
I didn't want
to put him in danger.

115
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,193
This?

116
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,612
This is nothing.

117
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,072
Ow.

118
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,991
OK.

119
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,412
Maybe this is something.

120
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,291
How is little Sasha?

121
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,877
I miss him already.

122
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,381
But after this,
I can be a real mother.

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,299
You are a real mother.

124
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,343
Not like I want to be.

125
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,928
We can go swimming.

126
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,930
Oh.

127
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,391
I can sing to him.

128
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,101
I already have a song.

129
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,145
I picked out the first one.

130
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,939
"Poust Vzegda Boudyit Solnse."

131
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,858
Oh, my Russian's
not that good.

132
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,486
It means,
"May There Always Be Sunshine."

133
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,531
That sounds beautiful.

134
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,535
OK, this is the last one.

135
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,086
And we're done.

136
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,222
Why so many?

137
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,517
Since we're using a new
material for your trachea,

138
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,229
Dr. Macchiarini wanted
to be extra careful.

139
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,025
We're preparing three tracheas
for your surgery,

140
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,526
just in case.

141
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,229
Hey, Lizzi,
please don't make a mess.

142
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,564
I need my gloves.

143
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,190
What do you need
your gloves for?

144
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,567
It's summer.

145
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,068
Well, we have to
unpack it anyway,

146
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,946
so what difference
does it make?

147
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,407
I know this is hard
to understand.

148
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,743
Well, then,
why don't you explain it to me?

149
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,745
Because it's complicated.

150
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,039
Hmm. Whatever.

151
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,708
- But it's for the best.
- How?

152
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,252
Paolo's the only good thing--

153
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,130
- The only good thing what?
- Nothing.

154
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,424
The only good thing what?

155
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,844
The only good thing that
happened to us since Dad died.

156
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,807
I know...

157
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,809
This sucks for both of us.

158
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,978
- Then fix it.
- I can't fix it, Lizzi.

159
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,813
It's not something that--

160
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,440
Why not?

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,942
I had to pack all my stuff,
have a goodbye party,

162
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,652
take stupid Spanish lessons.

163
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, we live in New York.

164
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,530
It's probably good to know
a little Spanish.

165
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,824
Oh, my God, Mom,
you're not listening to me.

166
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,498
Oh, God.

167
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,067
Don't move.

168
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,672
He wasn't even playing.

169
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,091
I just saw what
I wanted to see--

170
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,552
with the arrest,
with the wedding, all of it.

171
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,388
His CV--

172
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,640
he lists a fellowship
in thoracic surgery

173
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,434
at the University of Alabama.

174
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,353
They don't even have
a thoracic program.

175
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,897
He was never the Pope's
personal doctor, obviously.

176
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,232
Confirmed that
with the Vatican.

177
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,776
It's just
the personal life stuff

178
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,570
that seems to be more
of a black hole.

179
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,989
Born in 1958.

180
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,533
Lived in Switzerland--
at least I think that's real.

181
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,369
Married 1986 in Italy,

182
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,121
no divorce record on file

183
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,956
'cause he never actually
got divorced.

184
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,252
It's just lie
after fucking lie.

185
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,920
We've got to get you
out of this house.

186
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,464
You need to work, real work.

187
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,757
I'm going to start
making some calls.

188
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,258
You know what?

189
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,427
It's one thing to fuck with
my life, but with Lizzi's?

190
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,679
I want to tell her
the truth so badly.

191
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,724
But how can I when I don't
even know what the truth is?

192
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,061
But I really want
to figure it out.

193
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,939
Fuck it.

194
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,983
I'll go to him.
- Go where?

195
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,401
I don't know,
wherever I have to go.

196
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,111
I'm not going to watch you
do this to yourself.

197
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,906
Come on, Kim, I have to know
who this guy really is.

198
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,617
- Do you?
- Yes.

199
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,373
And this is why.

200
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,209
Another fucking article calling
him a rock star surgeon?

201
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,835
Well, how the hell are you
supposed to move on

202
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,630
when you still get
Google Alerts on the guy?

203
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,385
The entire world thinks he's
a miracle man because of me.

204
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,309
{\an8}<i> * Life is funny ♪</i>

205

208
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,486
Where have you been
the last few days?

209
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,364
I checked work, the bar,
the linen closet.

210
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,158
Then I ran out of places
that you'd go.

211
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,077
I just needed
some time to myself.

212
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,288
Well, time's up, I think.
We have work to do.

213
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,499
- Oh, do we?
- Yes.

214
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,418
To stop Macchiarini.

215
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,507
Going to have to pass
on that endeavor, Anders.

216
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,800
I--I--

217
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,511
I thought you would
be more, more.

218
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,061
OK, I know I turned my back
when you needed me.

219
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,355
But I'm here now.

220
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,443
We have to figure out
a way to stop this guy.

221
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,988
Maybe you were right
to turn your back.

222
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,990
I don't understand.
After Yesim--

223
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,700
What?

224
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,993
After Yesim, what?

225
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,870
I kept my promise to her.

226
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,997
It didn't make a difference.
He still got to walk away.

227
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,623
No, he's not walking.

228
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,877
He's publishing about Yesim.

229
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,712
While she was flatlining
on your table,

230
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:19,591
Paolo was writing a paper about
her successful transplant,

231
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,801
called it "a huge advancement
in the field."

232
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,971
He's being praised for it,
"a rock star surgeon."

233
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,140
Not only did he
destroy her life,

234
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,185
now he's profiting
off her pain.

235
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,811
If that sits right with you,
by all means,

236
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,439
let it sit that way.

237
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,404
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪</i>

238
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,044
I heard that
you were interested

239
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,046
in seeing your new trachea, correct?

240
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,507
This is a prototype,
an exact replica

241
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,218
of your natural trachea,
or more precisely,

242
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,178
what it looked like
before the accident.

243
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,181
It is built from
all the X-rays and CAT scans

244
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,851
that you and Dr. Lasbrey have
taken over the past few months.

245
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,437
Here, take it.

246
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,356
Yeah?

247
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,029
It looks like plastic.

248
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:29,744
Wouldn't it be better
to use a natural material?

249
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,455
I thought you might ask
something like that.

250
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,209
You will have heard
of Mr. Andemariam Beyene.

251
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,214
Do you know that a few days
before his operation,

252
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,384
he asked me and Dr. Lasbrey
the same question?

253
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,137
And then he had
the very same procedure

254
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,638
that you will receive.

255
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:53,101
And today, two years later,
he's thriving.

256
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,733
{\an8}, Yulia.

257
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:05,572
You will be in the most capable
hands every step of the way,

258
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,408
starting with Dr. Lasbrey,
who has already begun

259
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,827
preparing the implant
for transplantation.

260
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,234
All right,
all right, all right.

261
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,362
No need to feel me up.

262
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,835
Ciao.

263
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,717
I'm sorry.
My Italian is not very good.

264
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,552
Do you s--
- My English is fine.

265
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,345
Oh, OK.

266
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,764
My name is Benita Alexander.

267
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,683
I actually saw you
a few months ago.

268
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,521
I--I was here with
Dr. Paolo Macchiarini.

269
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,357
And you two exchanged
some words.

270
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,485
What the hell do you want?

271
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:12,032
I--I wanted to talk to you
about him, actually.

272
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,952
About what he did to you.

273
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,204
How'd you find me?

274
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,623
I'm a journalist.

275
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,168
Did he send you?

276
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,046
No. I sent myself.

277
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,714
And I'm so sorry.

278
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:32,302
When we--when you saw Paolo,
your son was with you.

279
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,888
What's his name?

280
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,016
- Nico.
- Nico.

281
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,770
I have a daughter a little
older than him, Lizzi.

282
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,234
So what--what happened?
What did he do?

283
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,403
Why you interested?

284
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,238
No one was interested
when it mattered.

285
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,531
Because I want the truth.

286
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:58,203
I want any kind of truth
about who he really is.

287
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,247
And you two seem
to have a history.

288
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,957
Was this about his arrest?

289
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,417
'Cause I read about it
in the newspaper,

290
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,002
but then I couldn't find any--

291
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,672
<i>I giornali,</i>
no, there wouldn't be.

292
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,550
You'll find it is very easy
to hide things away here.

293
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,304
Then tell me. Please.

294
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,850
Well, Paolo was a...

295
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,438
I trusted him,

296
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,273
trusted his prognosis
when my wife

297
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,944
was diagnosed with cancer.

298
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:35,865
Trusted in his research,
the future he promised us.

299
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,910
I trusted when he asked
for 150,000 euros

300
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,580
to skip the waiting list
for a donor.

301
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,000
I trusted far too much.

302
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,712
After she died,

303
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,757
we no longer seemed
to matter to him.

304
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:57,679
I tried to speak the truth,
but the code of silence here...

305
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,642
I'm surprised he was
arrested at all.

306
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,771
But then, of course,
he was cleared.

307
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,025
So I lost my work,
my savings,

308
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,986
and my wife.

309
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,575
Stay away from
Paolo Macchiarini.

310
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,870
Men like him,
they get away with murder.

311
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,484
Hello.

312
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,611
Hi.

313
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,157
Beautiful, isn't it?

314
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,284
It really is.

315
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:47,330
It's like a cocoon of color.

316
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,291
Hmm.
What brings you here?

317
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,960
Honestly, I don't--

318
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,256
I don't even know anymore.

319
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,091
Well,

320
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,762
this is good place to be
if you are lost.

321
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,597
Are you lost?

322
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,766
I'm on a mission.

323
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,019
That sounds really nice
and clear cut.

324
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,606
So where did this
mission of yours start?

325
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,567
South Korea,
a small neighborhood

326
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,193
called Yongsan-gu.

327
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,278
Yongsan-gu?

328
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,155
Mm-hmm, yes. You know?

329
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,865
I do. I do, actually.

330
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,743
I, um...

331
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:30,540
I knew a little girl
who was really sick, and...

332
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,792
she and her family
were from Yongsan-gu.

333
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,128
Hmm, a small world.

334
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,255
Yeah.

335
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:42,802
It's nice to be reminded
of how connected we all are.

336
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,306
Connected by God, you mean?

337
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,099
Mm, God,

338
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,268
a greater purpose,
coincidence--

339
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,020
call it what you like.

340
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,024
Just reminds me
we are not alone.

341
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,862
Ah,.

342
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,489
I sound like priest now,
don't I?

343
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,995
Would you mind
if I say a prayer

344
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,789
for the little girl
and her family?

345
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,208
No, I don't mind.

346
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,675
Ah, excuse me a moment.

347
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,845
I'll be right back.

348
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:57,057
We have a problem--
three, actually.

349
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,267
Yulia's tracheas,
they're defective.

350
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,686
- Which?
- All of them.

351
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,897
What is the issue?

352
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,023
They're flawed.
They're not--

353
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,860
What is the issue?

354
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,779
Number one is too soft.

355
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,697
- Mm-hmm.
- It's almost soggy.

356
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,115
OK.

357
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,534
Number two has several holes.
It's unusable.

358
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,329
- And number three?
- It's too short.

359
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:22,332
- How short?
- 3 millimeters.

360
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,674
Sod it.

361
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,468
We'll use the short one.

362
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,262
You don't think
we should postpone?

363
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,391
I can build a new implant,
recalibrate the bioreactor--

364
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,017
- No.
- It will only take a few weeks.

365
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,811
We cannot wait.

366
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,020
That trachea could fail.

367
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,439
Keep your voice down.

368
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:54,698
We cannot postpone.
We do not need to postpone.

369
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,282
It will be difficult.

370
00:26:56,282 --> 00:27:00,578
Difficult, but not impossible.

371
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,664
So now, you can continue
with the preparations

372
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,749
for the surgery, Dr. Lasbrey.

373
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,960
Thank you.

374
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,434
Come in.

375
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,770
Hi.

376
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,940
Hi, um...

377
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,068
I just wanted
to check in on you.

378
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,446
How are you feeling
about your surgery?

379
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:38,324
Are you scared at all, worried?

380
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,076
Well, you asking me
all these questions

381
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,911
is making me nervous.

382
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,958
If you asked less,
I would be calm.

383
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,044
Should I be worried?

384
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:55,633
It's just, I've been thinking
about it more and more.

385
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:58,762
And this new
synthetic material,

386
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,972
it hasn't been tested.

387
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,975
Yes, I know this.

388
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,311
So maybe you'd like to wait

389
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:09,230
until we can conduct
some proper trials.

390
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,483
Where is this coming from?

391
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,527
And why now,
after I've waited for so long?

392
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,154
I know that you've waited,
but we--

393
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:19,657
But you said
the procedure is safe,

394
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:23,745
that because I'm healthy,
I'll be OK.

395
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,706
I know what we told you.
But the new material--

396
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:30,669
New material or old material,
I don't give a shit.

397
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,046
I promised my son
that I would come back

398
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,007
and sing to him,
to run with him,

399
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,301
to laugh with him.

400
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,969
I want to be myself again.

401
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:43,306
Dr. Macchiarini is giving me
a chance to be myself again.

402
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:46,643
Do you really want
to be a human guinea pig,

403
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:52,023
a rat like all the others
we have caged up in this lab?

404
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:56,236
Look, I am begging you.

405
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,447
Just wait a little bit longer.

406
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:04,828
Even in a few months,
we'll know so much more.

407
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,996
I just want you to be safe.

408
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,795
OK.

409
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:17,799
OK.

410
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,011
I'll wait.

411
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,099
OK.

412
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh, hi.
Sorry, excuse me.

413
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,820
<i>Uh, perdóneme, un cafe de...</i>

414
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,585
I cannot believe you're here.

415
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:39,005
I figured you needed
an interpreter.

416
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,508
Oh, my God, Kim.

417
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:04,906
He told me Andrea Bocelli was
going to sing at the wedding.

418
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,951
Like, in what world?
- In our world, B.

419
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,703
Stop beating yourself up.

420
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:13,289
OK, you're going to stay
to the right up here.

421
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,166
We're doing this.

422
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,918
I didn't say a thing.

423
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:20,422
But if I said one thing,
this journey you're on,

424
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,881
I'm all for it.

425
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,759
I just--I hope you know
what you're looking for.

426
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,927
We were supposed
to come to this house

427
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,138
a dozen times while
we were together,

428
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,472
and we never made it.

429
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:30,974
He always had some reason.

430
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,767
And you think there's
some sort of answer here?

431
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,060
I do.

432
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,439
I think there is a part
of him here that's real.

433
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,065
How do you know
he's not going to be home?

434
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,734
He's in Russia--

435
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:43,361
big surgery,
very important patient

436
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:47,365
who I helped convince.

437
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:50,076
OK, it should be right up here.

438
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,542
This isn't it.

439
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,420
This can't be it.

440
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,930
No, no, no, no.

441
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,726
I've seen the videos
and pictures of this.

442
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,522
I have an entire house packed

443
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:24,486
of boxes ready to send here.

444
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,738
To this--

445
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,741
this empty fucking lot!

446
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,579
Come on,
what was the plan, Paolo?

447
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,414
What was the plan, seriously?

448
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:39,542
300 people flying to Italy for
a wedding that doesn't exist.

449
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,711
I packed my entire life up

450
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:44,547
to send to a house here
that doesn't exist--

451
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,675
my entire fucking life
committed to a man

452
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,844
and a future
that doesn't exist.

453
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:57,560
Oh, it's like...

454
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,813
it's like I'm in this fog, Kim.

455
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:00,980
It's like there's this fog.

456
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,399
And I just keep
running through it--

457
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,067
not even through it, to it.

458
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,028
And I'm just--I'm just, like,
completely fucking lost.

459
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,823
Like, I--I'm reaching out,
and I can't--

460
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,242
I can't hold on to anything.
I can't see anything.

461
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,576
I can't even see myself.

462
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,453
Like, am I here?
Do you see me?

463
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,330
Do you see me?
- I see you. I see you.

464
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,748
I see you.

465
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:22,627
And he's got you exactly
where he wants you.

466
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,676
I don't know what I would do
if you weren't here.

467
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:32,303
The tickets for the wedding
were non-refundable.

468
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,305
Don't say I never brought you
anywhere nice.

469
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,231
He's really good.

470
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,442
He's really, really good

471
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:46,985
at this whole fucking
lying thing.

472
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:50,196
Well, he was probably well
practiced before you met him.

473
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,494
When I met him...

474
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,705
Hold on.
When I met him.

475
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:02,542
I think I have...

476
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,252
the contract that he signed
for the show.

477
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,964
Ah, there it is.

478
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,091
OK, hold on.

479
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,639
Lemon trees.
- Lemon trees.

480
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,564
There it is.
That's the house.

481
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:27,317
OK, OK, OK.
OK, OK.

482
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,322
OK, so, um, what if there
are security cameras?

483
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:35,700
I wave and say hello.

484
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,620
Wow, my heart's actually
beating really fast.

485
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,954
OK.

486
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,415
All right.
Oh, God.

487
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,074
Oh, shit.

488
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,045
Oh, shit.

489
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:36,006
Oh.

490
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,492
Paolo.

491
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,866
Hola, Paolo.

492
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,618
What are you doing here?

493
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,372
I'm on holiday.

494
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,540
The tickets to the wedding
were non-refundable.

495
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,836
So I thought, what the hell,
why not see Europe?

496
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,672
And also,
I am so sorry about

497
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,716
what happened with the wedding.

498
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,679
I just--I had to come in person
and give you a gift.

499
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,514
That's very nice.
Thank you.

500
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:09,683
Something I picked up
in a gas station.

501
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,435
Very kind.
Where is your car?

502
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,937
Your car.

503
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,606
Oh, I--it's such
a nice day, I just--

504
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,775
I wanted to take a little walk.

505
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:22,070
So, uh,
I hope you enjoy your wine.

506
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,780
I'm sure you'll like it.

507
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,616
It's right up your alley.

508
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,178
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

509
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,447
Are you OK?

510
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:12,579
"An incredible place
to raise a child."

511
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,465
Pull over here.

512
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,085
You.

513
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:47,632
Do you remember that day,

514
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:50,593
the day you convinced us?

515
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,971
Lava tubes.

516
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,349
He was so impressed with you.

517
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:59,102
And do you remember
when he came back,

518
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,271
and he told you
how terrible he felt?

519
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,981
And you said,

520
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,900
"It's all normal.
Nothing to worry about.

521
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,445
Now smile for the cameras."

522
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:13,408
From the beginning,
we have meant nothing to you.

523
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,618
And now, as I stand here,

524
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:20,749
forced to end
my husband's life...

525
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,959
once again, here you are.

526
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:31,676
Now, when you remember this day,
will you feel shame?

527
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,850
Good.

528
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:04,334
All these data sets
are making my eyes cross.

529
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,169
I can't believe
you do this by choice.

530
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:07,379
Shh.

531
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,005
I feel like
I'm getting a hunch.

532
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,882
Am I getting a hunch?
- I'm getting a hunch

533
00:43:10,882 --> 00:43:13,885
you'll be kicked out of my lab
if you cannot focus.

534
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,934
Come in.

535
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:27,482
Ana. Uh...

536
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,275
How can we help you?

537
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,574
You were right about him,

538
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:38,326
about all of it.

539
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:43,957
Ande Beyene--he just died.

540
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:48,378
What the fuck
do you want, Ana?

541
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:52,007
I want to see it--
his trachea.

542
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,466
I want to see it
with my own eyes.

543
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:55,260
You've got to be joking.

544
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,929
An autopsy?

545
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:01,099
I have permission
from Mrs. Beyene.

546
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,851
I need to know the truth--

547
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,394
what this thing
really does to people.

548
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:08,398
We know what it does.

549
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:09,899
We have to go now.

550
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:11,484
He's being cremated
in the morning.

551
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:13,319
I went down that dead end
with Christopher Lyles.

552
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,446
Hedley won't--

553
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,197
We don't need
Hedley's permission--

554
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:20,243
not medically, not legally.

555
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:23,747
You won't get
into that morgue.

556
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,166
Paolo said his name
would open doors.

557
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:29,753
At least that much was true.

558
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:34,132
I still have full privileges,
for now.

559
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:35,884
Are you coming or what?

560
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,774
Hi.

561
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,443
How was your day?

562
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,215
<i>Whoa.</i>

563
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:59,884
<i>And another cartwheel.</i>

564
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,846
This is where
we stopped the endoscopy,

565
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:05,306
at the first suture.

566
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,058
He didn't look any further.

567
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:10,437
Afraid of what he might find.

568
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,526
<i>Oh, Mom, Mom, Mom, look.</i>

569
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,446
<i>Whee!</i>

570
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:20,905
<i>Have to change
the material...</i>

571
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:23,658
<i>not working.</i>

572
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:27,078
<i>the ones
we used on Mr. Beyene.</i>

573
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,503
<i>Whee!</i>

574
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:38,256
<i>Change the material...
clearly not working.</i>

575
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:43,053
<i>Yeah, they
we used on Mr. Beyene.</i>

576
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,395
Oh, God.

577
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:54,564
<i>So definitely, we have
to change the material</i>

578
00:46:54,564 --> 00:46:58,401
<i>because these are
clearly not working.</i>

579
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:01,571
<i>Yeah, they're all like the
ones we used on Mr. Beyene.</i>
