1
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,097
- You could have as little
as six months to live.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,932
"A Leap of Faith" is about
the patients

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,851
other doctors have given up on.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,102
And I love you, Benita.

5
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,813
- That is not how I wanted
you to find out.

6
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,314
- You don't cross those lines!

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,400
- Tomorrow I'm going
into a 14-hour surgery.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,152
They're gonna replace
half of my chest.

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,319
What are you doing?

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,988
- Would you like
to have dinner with me?

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,823
My place, 10:30?

12
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,158
- That works.
- Life is good

13
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,951
when you believe
good things can happen.

14
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,161
- Where's Chris Lyles?

15
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,328
- He passed away last night.

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,329
- What?

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,040
- Dr. Macchiarini is asking

18
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,666
what happened
with your trials.

19
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,210
Any mistakes could
slow down our progress.

20
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,462
Make sure that doesn't happen.

21
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,339
- I want to know you
better than anyone.

22
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,549
- Arresto?
- You got arrested?

23
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,468
- Speed limits are just
suggestions to me.

24
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,970
What if we could
continue like this

25
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,221
at home in Barcelona?

26
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,099
- We found a priest
for the wedding.

27
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,352
- ThePope is gonna marry you?

28
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,395
- Pope Francis will
be traveling

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,189
to South America this summer,

30
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,107
not Italy, not your wedding.

31
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,151
You've always had
great instincts.

32
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,112
Maybe you should trust them.

33
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,698
- Padraic, I need you
to look into someone for me.

34
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,618
The name is Paolo Macchiarini.

35
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:25,168
* *

36
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:35,345
* *

37
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:10,922
* *

38
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,355
- You were right.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,524
The Vatican is not happy
that Jorge agreed

40
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,444
to marry two divorcées
in the church.

41
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,446
- Our wedding's in three weeks.

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
- I know.
I thought I could

43
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,241
change things on my own.
I thought I--

44
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,743
honestly, I don't know
what I thought.

45
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,453
- Okay.
Y-you do realize

46
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,413
this isn't about the Pope
though, right?

47
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,124
You--you're hiding things
from me.

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,793
- I know you want
to know everything.

49
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,462
But it's not easy for me.

50
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,839
I have been alone too long.

51
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,924
I'm trying to create something,

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,468
and all I have is me.

53
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,136
And each time I come close,

54
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,264
there's always someone fighting
against it,

55
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,224
trying to stop me, so I--

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,393
I don't share.

57
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,770
I'm not used to it.
I don't know how.

58
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,647
I--I stay alone.

59
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,649
And it's very difficult
to let that go.

60
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,654
- I didn't even know
you felt that way.

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,615
- How would you?

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,492
I mean, honestly,
sometimes I think

63
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,911
I cannot trust anyone
but myself.

64
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,914
And you.

65
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,375
* *

66
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm just trying to make
this wedding perfect.

67
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,757
- I never asked you to do that.

68
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,510
- But I wanted to.

69
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,304
I wanted to because I know
how difficult it is for you

70
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,723
to give up your life here,
your job.

71
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,768
I didn't want to add more
to your worry.

72
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,689
Honestly, I didn't want
to give you a reason

73
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,607
to change your mind.

74
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,902
But the church, the reception,
nothing else has to change.

75
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,571
All I can hope is when you walk
out of that church,

76
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,325
when you listen
to those bells ringing,

77
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,619
that you will be happy.

78
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:11,084
* *

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:19,129
* *

80
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,360
- Excuse me.
Where is Dr. Macchiarini?

81
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,446
- Oh, Dr. Svensson.

82
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,908
They are all
at the press conference

83
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,286
in the lecture hall.

84
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,121
- Oh.

85
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,748
Okay.

86
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,708
- Today is a very special day

87
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,626
for all of us here
at Karolinska.

88
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,879
Today, our "Lancet" paper
was ranked

89
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,465
among the top ten
most important studies

90
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,383
on regenerative research.

91
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,344
However, I would like
to remind us

92
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,889
that we're all here because
of the courage of one man,

93
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,140
Andemariam Beyene.

94
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,938
Andemariam was handed
a death sentence

95
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,649
before he came to us
here in Stockholm.

96
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,028
But today,
six months after his surgery,

97
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,571
he is cancer-free...

98
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,572
And he's been able to return

99
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,823
to Iceland, to his family...

100
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,658
Where I believe that he's

101
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,037
nearly completed his doctoral

102
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,373
in geothermal engineering.

103
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,749
Am I correct, Andemariam?

104
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,833
- Yes.

105
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,128
His breath,
and therefore his life,

106
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,089
has been restored.

107
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,424
Ande, you are a living proof

108
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,927
of what these transplants
can achieve.

109
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,595
And we're just at the beginning
of this technology,

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,181
so you can all imagine
what we can do

111
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,600
for so many patients like him
around the world.

112
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,894
Ande, thank you very much.

113
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,896
And thank you all
for being here.

114
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,569
* *

115
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:22,961
* *

116
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,676
- Thank you.

117
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,431
Thank you.

118
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,269
Yeah, but--Ana, Ana.

119
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,396
Do you have five minutes?

120
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,564
- Of course.
- Yes? Okay.

121
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,690
Uh, let's go this way.

122
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,191
Let's go to my office.
- Okay.

123
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,778
- Thank you.

124
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,119
- Quite the turnout
for the event.

125
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,495
- Hm.

126
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,165
- So, uh, six months,

127
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,833
no additional surgeries,

128
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,086
no tangible advancements
in the technology.

129
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,797
I would say your research
is stagnating.

130
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,344
- I would argue
it's just the opposite.

131
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,181
We have a successful operation,
a published article,

132
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,808
an additional surgery
from which we can draw

133
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,143
a great deal of conclusions.

134
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,687
But the most important thing
that we've learned

135
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,149
is that we cannot execute
our research here,

136
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,650
not with your team,

137
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,152
not in your facilities.

138
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,528
- I beg your pardon?

139
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,030
- It's only the fault
of the regulations

140
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,156
here in Sweden.

141
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,616
We're shackled
by compassionate use.

142
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,202
Our patients here
are just too sick.

143
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,912
I have contacts in Russia...

144
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,831
- Oh.
- Who have offered us

145
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,919
a campus to conduct
additional research.

146
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,963
In Krasnodar, we can work
with full autonomy,

147
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,216
and any progress
that we see there

148
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,550
can be used to gain approval

149
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,927
for patient trials
back at Karolinska.

150
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,804
It only benefits our work here.

151
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,390
- Well, that is quite an ask,

152
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,266
to have Karolinska
hand you over

153
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,768
to Russia, of all people.

154
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,353
- It's not an ask.

155
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,146
It is an opportunity.

156
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,691
And it's not me
who you will be handing over.

157
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,318
I was hoping
to have Dr. Lasbrey

158
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,653
set up and run a lab there.

159
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,072
If Mr. Beyene showed us
one thing,

160
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,074
it's that there is
a pervasive need here.

161
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,826
Now we just have
to take the opportunity

162
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,244
that has been presented to us.

163
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,498
- Yes, well,
quite an opportunity.

164
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,502
* *

165
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,758
- Okay, tomato.

166
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,427
Okay. Two more.

167
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,805
Cheese.
- Cheese.

168
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,140
- Good morning.

169
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,850
both: Good morning.

170
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,438
- Wow. Maybe I should
sleep in more often, huh?

171
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,189
- Can I wear my hair in braids?

172
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,316
- No, we don't have time
for that, tesoro.

173
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,027
- You heard him.

174
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,904
I think your hair looks
really cute though.

175
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,573
Do you have your homework?

176
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,866
Oh.

177
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,620
Oh, God.

178
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,997
- What is it?
- Oh, we've been having

179
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,749
these issues
with our materials,

180
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,792
and it's causing
these costly delays.

181
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,377
It's a nightmare.

182
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,297
But if you want,
we can have dinner tonight,

183
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,551
and I can explain to you
every boring detail.

184
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,969
- It's a date.

185
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,014
- And you?
What is my superstar producer

186
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,142
going to do with her first days
of freedom from the newsroom?

187
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,061
- Hmm.

188
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,146
I think I'll probably
finish packing here,

189
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,275
and then hopefully
a whole lot of nothing.

190
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,443
- Perfecto.

191
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,986
- Hey.

192
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,279
All right, you got your phone?

193
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,947
Keys?

194
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,324
Lunch.

195
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,576
Love.
both: Mwah.

196
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,994
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

197
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,373
- Okay. Bye, my love.
- Bye.

198
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,168
What is that?

199
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,379
- What's what?

200
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,756
- That ringing.

201
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,050
Hey, Lizzi, is that your phone?

202
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,301
- No.

203
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,469
- Oh.

204
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,346
- Oh, mine.

205
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,516
My work phone.

206
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,060
Okay.

207
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,311
Okay, now we need to go.

208
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,313
* *

209
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,399
Get my keys.

210
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,151
- Bye.
- See you tonight, okay?

211
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,653
- Bye, guys.

212
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,946
- Bye, Mom.

213
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:26,121
* *

214
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:33,920
- So you're looking
for Dr. Macchiarini's

215
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,171
2008 pig study, yeah?

216
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,548
- Yes.

217
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,634
- Uh, you know,
the Bristol paper's online.

218
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,346
- Well, I'm looking
for raw data, eh,

219
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,515
notes, raw datasets,

220
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,726
any other trials that might
have gone unpublished.

221
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,395
I--I'm hoping
to cross-reference

222
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,022
for my own research here.

223
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,149
So...

224
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,358
- Sure, uh, just need to get

225
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,818
a sign-off
from the higher-ups.

226
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,028
Me boss is a bit
of a sheephead

227
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,487
about that kind of stuff.

228
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,656
- Uh, I'm one of the authors

229
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,658
of the follow-up study
in "The Lancet."

230
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,077
- Ah.
- So, uh, I, uh--

231
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,537
- Fine, but I-I'll still
have to get

232
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,164
Dr. Macchiarini to authorize.

233
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,500
- Oh. Oh, Dr. Macchiarini?

234
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,710
- Yeah.
- Ah.

235
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,171
Well, I'm requesting directly
from him.

236
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,090
Eh, he asked me
to give you a call.

237
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,302
- Okay, let me see
what I can find for you, mate.

238
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,928
- Thank you.

239
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,197
- Mr. Beyene, hello.

240
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,282
It's great to see you
in person again.

241
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,993
- I thought I was coming here
for a checkup.

242
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,537
But they told me
to bring a suit.

243
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,914
Now I understand.

244
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,540
* *

245
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,877
How could they say those things
when I feel like this?

246
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,796
- We'd like to do an endoscopy

247
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,381
just to confirm
your airway is looking

248
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,258
exactly the way it should.
- Where is Dr. Macchiarini?

249
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,219
- He's in an interview
at the moment, but--

250
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,805
- My wife begged me
not to come.

251
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,390
- I understand you're anxious.

252
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,766
You're tired.

253
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,393
The lingering symptoms
are expected,

254
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,687
but always taxing on the body.

255
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,108
- Ande, you had
six months to live.

256
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,360
Now you're sitting here
with your entire future

257
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,736
ahead of you.

258
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,697
This was a success

259
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,698
for all of us.

260
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,536
- Why don't you get some rest?

261
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,204
It's been a long day.

262
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:38,294
* *

263
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,762
- Thank you.

264
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,639
Thank you.

265
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,141
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

266
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,687
- Mrs. Lyles.

267
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,109
I'm so sorry about Chris.

268
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,445
He was very special.

269
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,612
- Thank you.

270
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,450
- I know this isn't
the best time

271
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,452
to burden you
with more paperwork,

272
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,288
but, uh, this is
an autopsy request.

273
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,290
I can help walk you through it
if you'd like.

274
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,793
- The other doctor said
an autopsy wasn't necessary.

275
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,628
- It's elective.

276
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,798
As the next of kin, you have
the right to request one.

277
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,343
- Why would we request one?

278
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,011
Was there something wrong
with the procedure?

279
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,679
- No, it's not that.

280
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,557
There are some battles
you simply can't win.

281
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,060
This is just for your own
peace of mind.

282
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,811
- Dr. Macchiarini fought
for my son

283
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,813
when all the other
doctors gave up.

284
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,440
We knew the risks.

285
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,983
We trust him.

286
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,027
- So did Chris.

287
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,989
He believed in this medicine,
the research.

288
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,616
I think he would have
wanted this.

289
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,036
- So you're saying this is good
for Dr. Macchiarini's work?

290
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,996
Wh-why didn't he ask for it?

291
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,416
- Like I said,
it's your choice.

292
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,045
My job is just to make sure
you know what the choices are.

293
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:09,302
* *

294
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,972
- Buongiorno. Hotel Gandolfo.

295
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,224
- Ciao.
Uh, I'm--I'm calling

296
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,268
about the Macchiarini wedding
on the 15th.

297
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,978
I just wanted to confirm

298
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,063
our reservation
for the reception hall.

299
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,274
- Of course. One moment.

300
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,109
- Thank you.
- Macchiarini, you say?

301
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,777
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,571
- Uh, I'm very sorry, signora,

303
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,490
but I have
no Macchiarini wedding.

304
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,868
- No, no, no, no, th--
no, th-that can't be right.

305
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,704
We're--we're supposed to have
the entire place booked out.

306
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,290
- I see here Dr. Macchiarini
has booked with us before,

307
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,376
but, uh, no wedding.

308
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,595
- You have reached
the Bonaparte Luxury Resort.

309
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,263
Please leave a message.

310
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,766
- Hi. Uh, my name
is Benita Alexander.

311
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,310
I'm calling about my honeymoon.

312
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,395
- No, signorina.
Is it perhaps

313
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,605
- under another name?
- We're sorry.

314
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,231
You have reached a number...
- No.

315
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,525
Um, can--can I speak
to the chef directly?

316
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,486
Madame,

317
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,198
the chef has never catered
a wedding in his life.

318
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,909
- Asshole.

319
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,036
- Macchiarini? No. No.

320
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,746
No, no, no.

321
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,874
We--we should have rooms
reserved, including suites.

322
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,377
Yes, we should have
rooms reserved, including--

323
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,005
Ciao.

324
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,216
Uh, I am--
I'm calling about the--

325
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,303
- Macchiarini? No. No.

326
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,596
- The Macchiarini wedding.

327
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:19,599
No, no, no. No.

328
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:26,564
* *

329
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,073
- Hi! Ah!
- Hello.

330
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,950
- Welcome. Come on in.

331
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,034
- Hello.

332
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,287
- Oh, hey, here.
This is 80 proof.

333
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,914
I know you don't like
the fruity stuff.

334
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,457
- Wow. Thank you.

335
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,502
That's very kind,
especially for you.

336
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,172
- He even wore a jacket
over his Springsteen T-shirt.

337
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,590
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,262
- Oh, this is my, uh...

339
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,680
- Márjá.

340
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,768
- For God's sake, Nathan.

341
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,939
I'm Wilma, welcome.

342
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,942
- That press conference today
was a fucking circus.

343
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,485
Uh, shit, sorry.

344
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,738
- You were there?
I--I didn't see you.

345
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,614
- I skipped it.
All I'm saying is that

346
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,366
it's ridiculous
how they paraded him around

347
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,951
in front of the cameras
like that.

348
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,245
- This was delicious, Anders.

349
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,289
- Thank you.
- Skal.

350
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,415
- Skal.
- Skal.

351
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,332
- Skal.
- Skal.

352
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,667
- Skal?

353
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,710
Skal?
- Skal.

354
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,213
- So how did
the two of you meet?

355
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,133
- I tend a bar
near the hospital.

356
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,178
- Ah. You're the one.

357
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,805
- I don't usually date the men
who come into the bar,

358
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,098
especially doctors.

359
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,641
Most are arrogant assholes.

360
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,352
- He's arrogant,
just not an asshole.

361
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,687
- Sometimes I'm an asshole.

362
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,106
- And Nate mentioned
you're a lawyer.

363
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,858
- Yes, I am--well, was.

364
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,818
I stepped down
after Axel was born.

365
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,363
We wanted one of us
to be here with him.

366
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,907
And somehow the rats won out
over the law.

367
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,325
- Ah.

368
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,493
- Mm.

369
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,619
- Oh, playtime.

370
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,787
That's my cue.
- Oh.

371
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,038
No, no, no, no, no, no,
you sit.

372
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,373
- No, no--
- I'll take it. I'll take it.

373
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,290
Yeah, you sit. You sit.
- Are you sure?

374
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,625
- Yep.
- Okay.

375
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,001
- You have boring
medical stuff to talk about.

376
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,294
- Um, may I join you?

377
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,545
- Uh, yes.

378
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,172
I'm better company anyway.

379
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,548
- Mm, that is true.

380
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,886
- I'll do the dishes.

381
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,012
- Great.

382
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,433
- I know that Macchiarini's
magic plastic had something

383
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,644
to do
with Christopher Lyles' death.

384
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,479
- You know this how?

385
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,564
- That press conference today,

386
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,067
it was an infomercial.

387
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,737
Lyles died, and Karolinska
is covering their ass.

388
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,449
I know how I sound,
but I--I'm not the only one.

389
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,494
There is a Belgian researcher,
Dr. Doris Dufort.

390
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,995
She has a blog
called "Phase IV."

391
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,206
She wrote a peer response
to your paper in "The Lancet."

392
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,041
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

393
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,376
- You've read it?

394
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,545
- No, uh, I don't entertain

395
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,922
fringe theories
from a rival in the field.

396
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,799
Doris Dufort is a troll.

397
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,175
- What about
your trial results?

398
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,885
Anything come up there?

399
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,182
That's a loaded silence.

400
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,643
I haven't released them, Nate.

401
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,895
I'm still compiling my report.

402
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,230
- That's bullshit.

403
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,278
I know you've got
a lot on the line.

404
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,155
You know, more--more
than I could ever understand,

405
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,574
but I--I know you.

406
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,867
I know that look on your face,

407
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,243
and I know you haven't said
a word all night

408
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,703
to contradict me.

409
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,081
Just promise me
that if you find anything,

410
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,208
you'll let me know.

411
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:41,760
* *

412
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,680
- Okay, we're
in the larynx now.

413
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,807
Okay, Ande, I'm going to push

414
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,185
through the vestibular fold.

415
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,230
- So you're gonna feel a little
pressure as I go in, okay?

416
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,735
- All right.

417
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,153
Yeah.

418
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,489
The stitches look good.

419
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,032
They look very good.

420
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,702
- You're doing beautifully,
Mr. Beyene.

421
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,330
- Okay, I see--I see some
inflammation at the top here,

422
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,499
but you've been traveling,
so that's not unusual.

423
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,502
- Okay, let's give you--

424
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,045
let's give you a little break.

425
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,466
Okay, I think that we're
all finished here.

426
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,510
Everything looks as it should.

427
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,136
- Do you want to retrieve
any samples

428
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,304
from towards the bronchi?

429
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,764
- No, no, no,
that's not necessary.

430
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:29,557
I'm satisfied.
But we're gonna give you

431
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,394
some antibiotics for that
inflammation, all right?

432
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,229
Good job, Ande.

433
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,397
I will check on you later.

434
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,564
Okay?
- Okay.

435
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,816
- Thank you.

436
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,945
- Well done.

437
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,323
- Dr. Lasbrey,
so we're not gonna biopsy?

438
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,491
I don't follow.

439
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,492
- The doctor said to leave it.

440
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,036
That's all you need to follow.

441
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:56,960
* *

442
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,921
- You only sent research
for bronchus testing.

443
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,633
I need trials
for the biosynthetic tracheas.

444
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,218
- That's what the lab sent up.

445
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,721
Well--

446
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,556
These data tables
are incomplete.

447
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,433
They are redacted.

448
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,101
There is no real
information here.

449
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,186
- If you want,
I can talk to me boss.

450
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,855
- No. Th-thanks.

451
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,273
Thank you.

452
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:36,541
* *

453
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:46,718
* *

454
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,603
- Hi.

455
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,396
- Hey, I just sent something
over to you.

456
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,898
Should be in your inbox.

457
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:00,982
- Okay.

458
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,027
Yep, got it.

459
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,029
- If it's an American school,

460
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,864
why do they make us
speak Spanish?

461
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,949
- It's probably not
what you were hoping to find.

462
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,369
- Uh, I--I have to run,
but I'll call you back.

463
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,079
Okay, bye.
- Hi.

464
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,413
Hey.
- Hi.

465
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,457
Hi.
- Who was that?

466
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,794
- Uh, it was Luke about
my final wedding dress fitting.

467
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,003
- What? Can I take a peek?

468
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,004
- No, no.

469
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,589
- Why not?

470
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,257
- Sorry.
- Ugh.

471
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,761
Tsk. Such a cruel tradition.

472
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,971
- Did you finish your homework?
- Almost.

473
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,598
- Why don't you go finish
your homework before bed?

474
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,433
- Okay.
- Okay.

475
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,310
- Buenos noches, papá.

476
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,687
- Buenas noches, tesoro.

477
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:39,896
Ah, that's so cute.

478
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,441
- You look exhausted.

479
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,151
- Oh, yeah.
- Was Lizzi a lot today?

480
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,653
Oh, God.

481
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,779
No, she was great.

482
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,239
It's this thing
that doesn't stop.

483
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,367
I definitely will
have to go back.

484
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,868
- Back where?
- To Russia.

485
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,579
The problems at the lab, it--

486
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,748
you understand, right?

487
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,209
- Yeah. Of course, yeah.

488
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,921
* *

489
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,007
Hey, I have a--an idea.

490
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,633
What if we have
chilled champagne

491
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,051
waiting for guests in the suite

492
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,928
when they arrive
for the wedding?

493
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,972
- Oh. Yeah, lovely.
That's nice.

494
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,015
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

495
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,099
- Is there someone
I should contact

496
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,892
at the hotel or...
- No, no, no, no.

497
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,687
It's okay. I--I got that.

498
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,023
Leave that with me.
I already pay the--

499
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,108
the final deposit for the--
for the reception hall.

500
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,193
You're gonna love it.
It's beautiful.

501
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,904
- Do you have
an early flight tomorrow?

502
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,823
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

503
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,325
Why don't you go get some rest?

504
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,456
- I'm never too tired for you.

505
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,297
- I'm never too tired for you.

506
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,468
Huh? You want me
to go to sleep alone?

507
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:58,516
* *

508
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:32,217
* *

509
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,215
What are you doing
out here in the dark?

510
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:27,605
* *

511
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,553
Russia's going to be
the longest

512
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,347
few days of my life.

513
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,306
- Yeah.

514
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,391
But I'm gonna have this place

515
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,644
pretty much entirely packed up
by the time you get back.

516
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,146
You don't want to be late.

517
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,565
- I love you.
- I love you.

518
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,029
* *

519
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,955
* *

520
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,374
Fuck.

521
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:37,384
* *

522
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,862
* *

523
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:01,157
- Paolo was arraigned
for extortion.

524
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,494
- He made up some bullshit
excuse about the arrest.

525
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,330
I mean, this guy--
this guy was in Italy.

526
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,916
- His name is Matteo Peralta.

527
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,085
Says here he's a plaintiff,
a widower.

528
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,212
He lost his wife.

529
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,714
And there were other charges--

530
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,800
embezzlement, deception,
extortion by multiple patients.

531
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,385
These are felonies.

532
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,931
- He--he lied to my face
so easily.

533
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,016
- Is he in the apartment

534
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,183
right now?
- No.

535
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,602
He's on his way to Russia.

536
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,147
- I did a background check
and criminal history.

537
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,190
I looked into
his personal history myself.

538
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,109
How--how did I miss
all of this?

539
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,861
- Our vetting is good,
but this?

540
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,654
This is designed to be missed.

541
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,322
The charges were dropped.

542
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:45,035
- I'm packing up my life
to move to Barcelona.

543
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,995
I gave notice on my lease.

544
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,288
I pulled Lizzi out of school.

545
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,498
I gave up my fucking job.

546
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,461
- What are you gonna do?

547
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,756
- I have to go to Luke's
for my wedding dress fitting

548
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,050
right now.

549
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:02,385
- Are you gonna tell Luke?

550
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,389
- I have to, right?

551
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:13,480
* *

552
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,041
- Hey.

553
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,542
- Why are we meeting
like spies?

554
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,965
Okay, uh, Christopher Lyles'
mother came to see me.

555
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:45,178
She said you pressured her
into performing an autopsy.

556
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:46,513
- It was
my professional opinion--

557
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,181
- Yeah, well, it seems
they weren't interested

558
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:51,267
in your professional
opinion, Nate.

559
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,936
And yet, you offered it.

560
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:56,564
Look, an autopsy is not going
to bring their loved one back.

561
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,109
You should have let them
just mourn in peace.

562
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,568
- Shouldn't that involve
knowing

563
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,903
why they're mourning
in the first place?

564
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,739
- Okay, look, Nate,

565
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,282
you are an excellent surgeon.

566
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,201
You--you care
about your patients

567
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:11,246
more than anyone
I have ever seen.

568
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,833
But really, just...
leave the dirty politics

569
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,960
to lesser men.

570
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,379
You went behind
Macchiarini's back.

571
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,089
- When Chris died,
Macchiarini was already

572
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,465
out of the country.

573
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,134
We don't know which way
his back was turned.

574
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,511
- I get it.

575
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,054
Every time we open a cadaver,

576
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,140
we're exposing this institution
to possible litigation.

577
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,183
- Okay, Christopher Lyles
was terminal.

578
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,979
Litigation didn't even
cross my mind.

579
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:40,316
My job is to steer clear
of bad optics.

580
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,569
- So our patient died,
it's unclear why...

581
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,446
- I'm sorry, unclear to who?
- And you're concerned

582
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,322
about a stain
on Macchiarini's reputation?

583
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:50,618
- Okay, I mean bad optics
for you, Nate.

584
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:53,663
Paolo's reputation
is impeccable.

585
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,415
And these claims are unfounded.

586
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,668
Some people could see
these maneuverings

587
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,963
as something incendiary.

588
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,507
Like a personal rivalry.

589
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,886
Professional jealousy.

590
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,682
Just watch your step, Doctor.

591
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:13,767
Please.

592
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,247
- We've had some success with
these cadaveric donor organs.

593
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,125
Although survival
in the body is short-term,

594
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,044
there's evidence
of gas exchange

595
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:44,005
and vascular perfusion
after transplantation.

596
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,215
- For how long?

597
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,591
- Two hours.

598
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,969
It was a milestone.

599
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,056
Follow me.

600
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,353
Take a seat, Dr. Svensson.

601
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,689
Oh, thank you.

602
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,401
- I must admit, I was wary

603
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,653
when you first
reached out to me.

604
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,364
Your name is
on "The Lancet" paper.

605
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,450
Naturally, I questioned
your motivations.

606
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:15,829
- You could say
I'm the one taking the risk.

607
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,664
I could be fired
for coming to you--

608
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:21,918
breaching an ethical wall,
crossing enemy lines.

609
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:25,255
- Some ethical walls are meant
to be breached,

610
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,799
especially in service
of the truth.

611
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,595
- I read your blog,

612
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,723
your response
to our article about, um--

613
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,183
- Andemariam Beyene's
transplant.

614
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,520
- I'm currently running trials

615
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,355
to support the results.

616
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,357
- Your paper was published

617
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,568
before you completed
your study?

618
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:51,072
So you come to me,

619
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,117
an act of scientific espionage.

620
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:58,455
I must say, I like your style,
Dr. Svensson.

621
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,459
- I--I also requested research

622
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,669
from Dr. Macchiarini's
previous work in Bristol,

623
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,713
but, uh,
I couldn't find anything.

624
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:10,175
- No. You wouldn't, would you?

625
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,385
Nothing but a stone wall.

626
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,221
I had the same
funny feeling as you

627
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,765
way back in 2008,

628
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,852
before anybody had
grand designs.

629
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:22,729
Those are for you.

630
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:26,816
* *

631
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,318
Go on.

632
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,820
Too late to turn back now.

633
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,828
Dr. Macchiarini is setting
a very dangerous precedent,

634
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,873
making this kind of
experimental surgery elective.

635
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,166
- N-no, we haven't.

636
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,418
It is only approved
for compassionate use.

637
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,712
- For now.

638
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,931
* *

639
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,486
- Yesim?

640
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,571
Hi. I'm Dr. Gamelli.

641
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,783
Uh, I'll be doing
your intake today.

642
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:21,996
So...you're here from Turkey.

643
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:26,793
Well, it's very brave to come
all this way on your own.

644
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:30,714
- I've been to 12 countries,
but never to Sweden.

645
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,757
I'm worried more for my father.

646
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,676
He's meeting me here
in a couple days,

647
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,469
but he's traveling on his own,

648
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,097
and his English is not so good.

649
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:41,599
- Well, how about his Swedish?

650
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,184
- Even worse.

651
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,061
- I'm sure he'll do fine.

652
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:49,607
You're here
for a consultation, I see.

653
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,819
Your trachea was injured
during an operation?

654
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,866
- My hands, they sweated a lot.

655
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,410
My doctors back home,
they tried to fix it,

656
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:02,954
but something went wrong
with the--

657
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,956
- What they tried to do
is a very risky

658
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,875
surgical procedure.

659
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,710
- After this,
they couldn't help,

660
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,129
so they recommended
Dr. Macchiarini.

661
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:14,507
He's the best in the world.

662
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,511
- There's my lovely
young patient.

663
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,472
So good to finally meet you
in person, Yesim.

664
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:21,890
Welcome to Karolinska.

665
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,600
This is Dr. Lasbrey.
- Hi.

666
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,810
- Thank you, Dr. Gamelli.

667
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:35,111
* *

668
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,113
It really pains me to see
someone as young,

669
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:40,200
as beautiful as you are
suffering like this.

670
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:43,161
We are all so very happy
that you're here with us today.

671
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:44,829
We're also very lucky

672
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,374
that the talented
Dr. Lasbrey is with us

673
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,459
for one last procedure.

674
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:55,965
* *

675
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,051
- Hi.

676
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,344
- Hi.

677
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,811
- I'm just taking
the hem up a little bit.

678
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:12,857
- What is it?

679
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:17,320
- I promised Paolo
I wouldn't say anything, but...

680
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,239
the Pope agreed

681
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:23,910
to give me and Michael
Holy Communion at the wedding.

682
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,413
- What?
- I know.

683
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,748
After all the shit
our families put us through

684
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,208
when we got married.

685
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,752
My mom, she refused to come.

686
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,920
- No, I--I remember that--

687
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,547
- And now
the freaking Pope giving--

688
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,465
giving her little boy
Communion?

689
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,968
For her to see that now,
it's just--

690
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:42,012
Paolo's just--

691
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,014
he's really special, Benita.

692
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:49,436
* *

693
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,063
Okay.

694
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,398
You ready?

695
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:09,080
* *

696
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:21,843
Axel, Axel.

697
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,637
Axel!

698
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:25,889
Ugh!

699
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:33,563
Axel.

700
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:37,192
Sweetie, I know you're upset.
I'm coming in now.

701
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,278
We'll just skip to quiet time,
okay?

702
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,955
- Okay.
- Well, have fun with Aubrey.

703
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,665
I'll see you in the morning.
Love you.

704
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,084
Good night.

705
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:21,820
* *

706
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,988
Paolo?

707
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:57,689
* *

708
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:30,263
* *

709
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:44,569
Paolo?

710
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:46,404
- Do you trust me?
- Oh.

711
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,947
Oh, God.

712
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:49,657
What are you doing?

713
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,076
- It's a surprise.

714
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,121
- Are you ready?

715
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:07,967
- You're supposed
to be in Russia.

716
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,136
- They delayed my flight.

717
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,180
And I have a beautiful idea.

718
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:15,058
Let's get married right here.

719
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:16,893
Friends and family
or just the two of us.

720
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:18,728
Tomorrow if you want.

721
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,355
Let's do it.

722
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,402
- Was that your plan all along?

723
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:28,113
When everything eventually
fell apart, we would just--

724
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:31,032
we would get married
up here on my rooftop?

725
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,909
- I would marry you
under a bridge if I had to.

726
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:34,035
What's going on?

727
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,498
- Paolo, I called everywhere.

728
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:40,333
No one knows anything
about our wedding--

729
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,918
nothing.

730
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,837
- Is that what this is about?

731
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,131
Benita, we have
important guests

732
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,632
that require discretion.

733
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:50,510
Our wedding was supposed
to be confidential.

734
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:52,220
What did you expect
to find out without me?

735
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,055
What's going on?
- You're lying to me.

736
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,557
- Why would I lie to you?

737
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:58,143
- And I trusted you
with my daughter.

738
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,271
I was getting ready to uproot
my entire fucking life

739
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,647
for a lie?

740
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:05,275
* *

741
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,861
- I made a few mistakes,
and you're still punishing me.

742
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,154
- No, no, no, no, I--
- I thought we were past that.

743
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,739
- I looked into everything.

744
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:12,449
I looked into you.

745
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,950
- You looked into me?
- Yeah.

746
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,118
- Why would you look into me?

747
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:17,287
- Why me, Paolo?

748
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,539
Why me?

749
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm a journalist.
You had to know at some point,

750
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,835
I was gonna start
asking questions.

751
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,211
- Yeah.

752
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,213
That's what I love about you.

753
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,508
- That man in Italy had
a wife...

754
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:31,968
- Oh, God.
- Who was your patient.

755
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,553
He wasn't mafia.

756
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:35,096
He wasn't some stranger.
- Please, Benita.

757
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:36,473
- He wasn't an enemy.
- Please.

758
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:37,682
- What did you do to them?
- Baby, don't do this.

759
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,726
- What did you do to them?

760
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:46,775
* *

761
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,835
There are certain things
I didn't want

762
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,420
to have to tell you.

763
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,881
You're giving me no choice.

764
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:13,551
Benita, my work, what I do,

765
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:17,681
is tied to governments,
heads of state,

766
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,391
oligarchs.

767
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,769
I've been forced to treat
some very bad people.

768
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:24,771
And you don't want to go
digging in there, Benita,

769
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:25,980
because it's dangerous.

770
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,565
It is dangerous for me.

771
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,234
It is dangerous for you.

772
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,695
It is dangerous for Lizzi.

773
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,029
What I'm trying to do
is to protect you.

774
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:34,489
- Paolo.

775
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:40,662
Paolo.

776
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,543
You need to leave.

777
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:53,675
* *

778
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:14,237
* *

779
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,956
- All of his work,

780
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:27,625
his--his grant, his everything,

781
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,210
it's all based on a lie.

782
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:33,173
- They performed trials
with donors, cadavers,

783
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,759
but never
with the biosynthetic tracheas.

784
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,428
- So those pigs
from that first presentation,

785
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,056
they were really
just happy fucking pigs?

786
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:43,266
- In my rat trials,

787
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,144
there were no evidence
of stem cell growth.

788
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,563
Once the implants went
into the bodies, just--

789
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:50,815
- Detachment, infection,
fungus.

790
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,817
- All leading
to collapse of the airways.

791
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:56,738
No cartilage tissue,
no regenerated blood supply.

792
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:00,158
- "It's like magic."

793
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:02,619
That's what he said,
how the tracheas work.

794
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:03,536
And it is.

795
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:06,748
It's all smoke and mirrors.

796
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,625
- Hm.

797
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,168
My trials failed.

798
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,337
They were doomed to fail.

799
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:15,423
- Because he never did
any trials in the first place.

800
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,301
- Nate...

801
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:20,970
the patients are the trials.

802
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:27,018
He's experimenting on people.

803
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:34,192
* *

804
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:44,202
* *

805
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:48,707
- * He looked
right through me *

806
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,500
* Yeah *

807
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,877
* *

808
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:57,632
* "Come on home, girl,"
he said with a smile *

809
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:01,594
* "You don't have to love me
yet, let's get high awhile *

810
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,264
* "But try to understand *

811
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,766
* "Try to understand *

812
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:10,520
* "Try, try,
try to understand *

813
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:12,731
* I'm a magic man" *

814
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:16,234
* *

815
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:18,403
* Winter nights,
we sang in tune *

816
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:20,905
* Played inside
the months of moon *

817
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,657
* Never think of never *

818
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:25,326
* Let this spell
last forever *

819
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,537
* Well, summer lover
passed to fall *

820
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:30,123
* Tried to realize it all *

821
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:32,208
* Mama says she worried *

822
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:35,086
* Growing up in a hurry *

823
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:36,671
* Yeah *

824
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:39,507
* *

825
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:43,720
* "Come on home, girl,"
Mama cried on the phone *

826
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:46,222
* "Too soon to lose
my baby yet *

827
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,475
* My girl should be at home" *

828
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,560
* But try to understand *

829
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:53,355
* Try to understand *

830
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,025
* Try, try,
try to understand *

831
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,569
* He's a magic man, Mama *

832
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:03,656
* Ah, he's a magic man *

833
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:10,747
* *

834
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:20,632
* "Come on home, girl,"
he said with a smile *

835
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:23,009
* "I cast my spell of love
on you *

836
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:25,136
* A woman from a child" *

837
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:30,058
* But try to understand,
try to understand *

838
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:34,521
* Oh, oh, oh *

839
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:38,274
* Try, try, try
to understand *

840
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,653
* He's a magic man *
