1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,724
- I read this
piece in "The Times"

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,726
about this little girl
who needs a new windpipe.

3
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,519
Name's Hannah Warren.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,146
Her family's working
with this doctor in Europe.

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,314
- Dr. Paolo Macchiarini.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,859
- The focus of my research
is tracheal transplants

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,736
with the help of stem cells

8
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,072
by developing
biosynthetic tracheas.

9
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,574
- So you're basically
tricking the body

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,367
into thinking the implant's
already a part of you.

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,703
- Will you be interested
in assisting?

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,038
- Yes. Yes.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,664
- I was wondering
if you would be interested

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,250
in collaborating on rat trials
to test our tracheas.

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,294
- Absolutely.
- Welcome to the team.

16
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,296
- So this is the first
artificial-trachea transplant

17
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,048
in the U.S.,

18
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,800
and I want Hannah's journey
to be the focus of the piece.

19
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,177
- Surgery went well.

20
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,888
- I have watched you
for a while now.

21
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,765
What you did, it was a miracle.

22
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,560
Paolo, I shouldn't.

23
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,812
- The science
doesn't seem sound.

24
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,606
- It's not exactly
your kind of science.

25
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,443
- I will admit I don't get it.

26
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,736
- Knife.

27
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,447
After the operation,
she's healthy and happy

28
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,782
with her donor trachea.

29
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:34,719
* *

30
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:57,534
* *

31
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:24,978
* *

32
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:35,196
* *

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,836
- Hannah Warren
will be the youngest patient

34
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,089
ever to receive a biosynthetic
tracheal transplant.

35
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,841
- Okay, stop right there.

36
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,636
Let's swap this out to play
over Dr. Macchiarini talking

37
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,930
about the initial diagnosis.

38
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,391
I think we still need a
little more B-roll

39
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,728
with the parents,
but we are close to locking.

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,229
Ow.

41
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,606
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

42
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,529
Hi.

43
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,823
I was just talking about you.

44
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,201
- Uh, Benita.

45
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,869
- Daryl?

46
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,245
- I called to, um--

47
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,040
I called to tell you she, uh--

48
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,375
she's gone.

49
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,835
What?

50
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,254
- Hannah's gone.

51
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,425
- What--what do
you mean she's gone?

52
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,886
- It was--
There were complications.

53
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,932
Her--her lungs, after all
the time in the hospital,

54
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:48,061
she just--
her body couldn't, um...

55
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,271
Hannah's gone.

56
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,566
We were with her, and she
just kept getting worse.

57
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,194
We thought maybe
she was gonna--

58
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,446
that it would pass, but, uh--

59
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,953
* *

60
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,085
- Mom, your phone.

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,013
Is it work?
- No, it's not work.

62
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,641
What's up with
the braids, kiddo?

63
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,602
I haven't seen you repeat
a hairstyle twice,

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,440
let alone three times,
in a week.

65
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,817
- Dad liked my hair this way.

66
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,576
- I miss him, too.

67
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,954
But I think you look great.

68
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,330
You ready for school?

69
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,098
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,892
- I wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

71
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,186
You're not answering
my phone calls, my texts.

72
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,562
- You shouldn't be here.

73
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,773
- I know you heard
about Hannah.

74
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:22,364
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay, Benita.

75
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,949
- I thought
she was getting better.

76
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,494
- There were complications.
- "Complications.

77
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,912
"Fragile native tissue.

78
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,246
Weakening of the lungs."

79
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,500
I-I read the reports, Paolo.
I know the medicine.

80
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,628
But you told me she
was getting better.

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,215
- She was very sick.

82
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,926
And she was going to die.

83
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,135
I tried.

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,349
You think that I'm not upset?

85
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,559
But I won't give up.

86
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,104
I don't have
the right to give up.

87
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,566
- No, Paolo, don't.
I-I can't do this.

88
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,237
Let's just call it
what it is, okay?

89
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,572
- What is it?

90
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,616
- A mistake.

91
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,704
- Colleagues, board members,

92
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,706
we are so glad
to have you here

93
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,290
for this momentous occasion.

94
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,545
Tomorrow we will perform the
first-ever human transplant

95
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,839
using a bioartificial scaffold.

96
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,550
Our patient is
Andemariam Beyene,

97
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,012
a 36-year-old Eritrean
PhD student

98
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,722
living in Iceland.

99
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,516
Two years ago, he developed
a malignant tumor

100
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,143
in his windpipe.

101
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:37,063
They have tried radiation
and surgical intervention.

102
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,398
All failed.

103
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,568
So his doctors
referred him to us.

104
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,236
As you all know,
we only have approval

105
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,032
to perform this procedure
as compassionate use,

106
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,408
a last resort.

107
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,744
We have designed
a biosynthetic trachea

108
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,538
tailor-made
to Mr. Beyene's anatomy,

109
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,790
down to the last micrometer.

110
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,043
- And this truly
is the breakthrough

111
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,795
that will launch us
as a global destination

112
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,547
for this kind of medicine.

113
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,965
- Ladies and gentlemen,

114
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,136
I present to you the future
of regenerative medicine.

115
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,933
Within weeks,
it will grow tissue,

116
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,270
transforming into an actual,
living trachea.

117
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,024
* *

118
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,530
Dr. Macchiarini, I am sorry.

119
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,575
I no longer wish
to have the surgery.

120
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,870
We feel it is too risky.

121
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:38,291
- It is completely natural
to have concerns, Mr. Beyene.

122
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,959
- The trachea, it's plastic.

123
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,754
How can you be sure
it will work inside my body?

124
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,090
- There you misunderstand.

125
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,591
It is not plastic.

126
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,885
The trachea is medical-grade

127
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,681
polymeric
nano-composite material.

128
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,058
- If I may.
- Yeah, of course.

129
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,269
- Mr. Beyene, you're studying
lava tubes in Iceland.

130
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,896
Is that right?
- Yes.

131
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,690
- I believe
the recellularization process

132
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,483
is just like that.

133
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,818
When a volcano erupts,

134
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,570
underground lava rivers
create tubes.

135
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,781
When the lava drains,
the tubes remain,

136
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,491
but now they're rock solid.

137
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,159
They become a part
of the Earth.

138
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,037
And that means
they last forever.

139
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,497
That's what your
stem cells will do

140
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,249
to the synthetic trachea

141
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,211
to make it last forever
as a part of you.

142
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,089
- You're asking my husband
to be the first

143
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,883
but offer no guarantee
the procedure will work.

144
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,886
- No, we cannot offer
guarantees

145
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,806
because it would be
irresponsible to do so.

146
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,226
Nothing is guaranteed
in medicine.

147
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,894
Even just a year ago,

148
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,398
your options would have been
much more limited.

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,651
You are very lucky
to be the first.

150
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,029
Your doctors referred you to us

151
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,032
because the other treatments
failed you.

152
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,785
You could have as little
as six months to live.

153
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,748
This is your best chance
to see your son grow up.

154
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:06,921
* *

155
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,304
- Okay.

156
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,807
- Okay.

157
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,479
I think it's very difficult
to keep an emotional distance,

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,314
especially if it is a child.

159
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,234
Hey.

160
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,237
How you holding up?

161
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,073
- I wish I felt numb.

162
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,492
I just feel...

163
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,660
everything.

164
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,165
- Give yourself a break, B.

165
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,921
You're not on a schedule here.

166
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,964
- It's gonna take
what it takes.

167
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,094
- You know, with
Hannah Warren and John...

168
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,222
it's just a whole lot of death.

169
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,182
- How's Lizzi?

170
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,020
- She's really quiet.

171
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,400
I think she's pretending to be
okay for me,

172
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,154
which makes me feel guilty,
which makes me feel worse.

173
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,366
She's just such a daddy's girl.

174
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,328
And that breaks my heart.

175
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,665
- At least you still have
a heart to break.

176
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,376
- Yeah, the pain reminds us
we're alive.

177
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,753
It's awesome.

178
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,755
- Work is good?
- Work is good.

179
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,674
Work is good.

180
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,218
- Hey, how's that piece
coming along?

181
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,637
- Hey, it's not.

182
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,848
It's...

183
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,808
a special about the future
of medicine.

184
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,643
It's supposed to be hopeful.

185
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,604
And now I don't have
a story at all.

186
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,816
- What about him?
- What about him?

187
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,693
- Shift the focus
to him, you know?

188
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,236
"Dr. Macchiarini,
Miracle Man"--

189
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,613
a look at the pioneer
of generational medicine.

190
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,824
- Regenerative.
- Exactly.

191
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,451
- But then what about Hannah?

192
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,288
- She'd still be part
of the main story.

193
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,999
Medical breakthroughs
are always paved with setbacks.

194
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,792
It doesn't mean
that Macchiarini's work

195
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,502
isn't worth believing in.

196
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,504
* *

197
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,006
- Hold on to the hopeful.

198
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,800
- If anybody can make
it happen, it's you.

199
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:21,973
* *

200
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,951
When did the pain start?

201
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,496
- Um, off and on
for the last few weeks.

202
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,915
I just thought it was stress
or something.

203
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,335
- Would you describe the pain
as sharp, dull, or burning?

204
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,796
- Sharp, like--
- Aah!

205
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,589
Like someone's
stabbing me. Ow.

206
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,008
- Let's get a CBC,
liver enzymes,

207
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,761
urine test, and a CT
of the abdomen and pelvis,

208
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,013
plus 30 milligrams
of Toradol for the pain.

209
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,141
- So it's my appendix?
- It's not your appendix.

210
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,935
- What?
No, no, no, no, no.

211
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,645
I have a daughter.
She's nine years old.

212
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,230
She just lost her father.

213
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,856
I can't have something wrong
with me.

214
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,275
- We just need to run some
tests to see what's going on.

215
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,610
- Doctor, they're waiting.

216
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,696
- Is there anyone
you want to call?

217
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,038
- Hi, excuse me.

218
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,586
Hi.
- Hi.

219
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,588
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,757
- No, no, I'm glad you called.

221
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,509
Has the pain subsided?
- No.

222
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,302
I think it's worse, actually.

223
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,971
- What did the doctor say?
- Nothing.

224
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,641
They just ran a bunch of tests,
and no one's told me anything.

225
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,060
I've just been sitting here
by myself.

226
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,524
- You CT scan
shows uterine fibroids.

227
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,651
- What? What is that?
Is that cancer?

228
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,529
- Not at all.
They're very common.

229
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,991
Is it okay if I take a look?
- Yeah.

230
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,909
- Yeah?
- Okay.

231
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,830
- This might hurt a little bit.
- Okay. All right.

232
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,916
Okay.

233
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,089
Yeah, I can feel two.

234
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,841
They're about the size
of grapefruits.

235
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,009
- What?

236
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,969
- It sounds much worse
than what it is.

237
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,263
Don't worry.
They will have them removed.

238
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,848
- So I have to have surgery?

239
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,975
- Yeah, but it's
a very common procedure.

240
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,020
I'm sure your doctor will walk
you through everything.

241
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,439
You're gonna be fine.

242
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,858
Trust me.

243
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,823
* *

244
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,081
- He's got you
working late already?

245
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,248
- I'm preparing.

246
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,250
It's something doctors do.

247
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,544
You should try it.
- Noted.

248
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,130
- I'll sleep
when I'm published.

249
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,886
- Why don't you like him?

250
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,055
- I don't really like anybody.

251
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,807
- That's true.

252
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,560
Still, so few surgeons want to
operate on the throat at all,

253
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,854
and he throws in
stem-cell regeneration.

254
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,440
Aren't you interested
in his work?

255
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,860
- Yes, yes,
I find it all very...

256
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,487
interesting.

257
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,489
- You're an ass.

258
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,116
Look at this.

259
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,577
He has to identify the surgical
planes bordering the trachea,

260
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,746
avoid tumor dissemination,

261
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,581
all without exposing
the larynx,

262
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,583
the thyroid, the esophagus.

263
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,918
Say what you want.

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,087
Dr. Macchiarini's
got some balls.

265
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,923
- I guess that's what it takes,
huh--some nice big balls?

266
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,050
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to offend you.

267
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,052
- Yes, I have tiny balls.

268
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,848
You know, a good surgeon
knows when not to cut.

269
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,392
- Fuck that. I'm tired of being
on the verge of something.

270
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:56,271
Too afraid to make the cut--
this is groundbreaking work.

271
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,273
I'm getting in.

272
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,276
- Just watch your back.

273
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,194
- I always do.

274
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:12,871
* *

275
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:38,021
* *

276
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,502
- Dr. Svensson.

277
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,338
- Dr. Macchiarini?
Uh...

278
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,470
- Oh, the trials seem
to be proceeding nicely.

279
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,638
- Uh, yes.

280
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,099
Um, we're on schedule.

281
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,392
- Good.

282
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,436
Any exciting conclusions
so far?

283
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,355
- Well, nothing--
you know, nothing

284
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,023
really determinable yet.

285
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,484
Of course, I won't be able
to truly discern

286
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,069
any results until--

287
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,613
- Yeah, until you completed
the trials, of course.

288
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,865
As you can imagine,
I'm--I'm very anxious

289
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,910
to see any results--
positive or otherwise.

290
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,038
- Well, on the test rats

291
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,040
that have received
synthetic tracheas,

292
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,042
so far none
have responded negatively.

293
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,919
- Well, that--
that is excellent.

294
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,213
- But as you said,
we're still gathering data.

295
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,799
Uh...

296
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,259
the purpose of this trial

297
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,720
is to witness
objective results, of course.

298
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,764
- Of course, of course.

299
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,850
- May I ask, is there
anything in particular

300
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,269
that is concerning you?
- Oh, no, not at all.

301
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,730
I have complete faith
in your research, Doctor,

302
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,231
as well as my own.

303
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,025
I'll just leave you
to your work.

304
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,359
- Okay.

305
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,652
Yeah.

306
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:13,825
* *

307
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,050
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

308
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,844
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

309
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,304
Oh, my God, please.

310
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,015
- Wow, I wish I had
that effect on you.

311
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,850
- 48 hours without caffeine?

312
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,352
Who am I today?

313
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,065
- I spelled your name for them.

314
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,737
You're feeling better?
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,948
I am.
Like two grapefruits lighter.

316
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,742
Thank you, really.

317
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,077
- Pleasure.

318
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,749
- Paolo...

319
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,252
we've both been through a lot
of loss the past few months.

320
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,547
And I know I wasn't dying
in there, but I--

321
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,925
I was really scared, and it...

322
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,929
It just--

323
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,223
it put things
in perspective for me.

324
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:22,185
Us together, it could cost me
my job, my reputation,

325
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,939
but I think this thing we have,
it's worth the risk.

326
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,651
- For me, too.

327
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:34,114
* *

328
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,658
- You've heard the criticism--

329
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,703
that you're really taking
a chance with these patients.

330
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,746
What do you say to that?

331
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,916
- I was raised to believe
that if you...

332
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,044
if have even one chance,
you need to take it,

333
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,338
because either that
patient will die,

334
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,383
or we try to do something,
even if it's new.

335
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,345
As a doctor and--
and as a human being, I...

336
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:01,683
I ask myself, are we
allowed to say no?

337
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,309
I don't think we are.

338
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,895
- And when you got
that call later

339
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,356
that--that she had passed...
- Mm.

340
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,526
- It had to be devastating
for you.

341
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,070
- I couldn't stop thinking...

342
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,240
did I make the right decision?

343
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,576
Did I do everything
to save her?

344
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,912
There are so many patients
all around the world

345
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,456
who need this procedure.

346
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,375
We should really try
to achieve this

347
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,085
for all of them,

348
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,171
because even
in the face of failure,

349
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,381
we should keep hope alive.

350
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:37,719
* *

351
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,471
- Great job today, guys.

352
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,265
Dr. Macchiarini,
do you mind staying behind

353
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,392
for a few minutes
to go over the schedule?

354
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,727
- Good night.

355
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,688
* *

356
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,357
- Of course.

357
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,611
So?

358
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,196
- So...

359
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,491
Well, I have some
follow-up questions for you

360
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,575
that are gonna happen...

361
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,828
- Really?
- Behind closed doors, yeah.

362
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,878
- I'm so sorry you had
to go through this.

363
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,507
- It's okay.

364
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,218
It's just gonna be a scar.

365
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,719
- One day we will live
in a world

366
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,639
where we won't have to cut
people open to fix them.

367
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,224
You'll see.

368
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,355
- Do you ever have any doubts?

369
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,648
- Of course I do.

370
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,067
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,237
- 'Cause you seem so sure
of all of it.

372
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,491
Even the things
that could go wrong,

373
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,202
that have gone wrong...

374
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,372
you just keep moving forward.

375
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,417
- I think a lot about the ones
who came before me.

376
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,046
Like Thomas Starzl--

377
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,924
he started
the first liver transplants.

378
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,719
His first patients died.
- Hmm.

379
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,346
- Or Christiaan Barnard...

380
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,599
he performed
the first heart transplant.

381
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,935
People threw rocks at him.

382
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,522
Everybody thought he was crazy.

383
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,524
- I'm sure people
looked at him the same way

384
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,484
that you're looking
at me right now.

385
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,281
* *

386
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,826
When Hannah died,
I did lose faith.

387
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,120
But these doctors, they--

388
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,749
they believed, they worked,
they persevered

389
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,876
until they found their way.

390
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,919
Being the one
to try something new,

391
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,379
no matter the personal cost,

392
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,798
is vital
to move medicine forward.

393
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,343
It's vital.

394
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,803
And I believe that the work
that we're doing

395
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,182
is going to save many lives.

396
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,517
- I believe it will, too.

397
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:56,191
* *

398
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,618
- Hi, my love. I'm here,
missing you in Barcelona.

399
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,661
The lemon trees
are ready for you.

400
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,248
- Oh, there is a sushi roll
with my name on it.

401
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,918
Benita?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah, lunch.

402
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,711
- You ready?
- Sorry. Yeah.

403
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:17,921
- Good.

404
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:26,012
* *

405
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,100
* *

406
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,185
- Mm.
- Come on, come on...

407
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:39,359
* *

408
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,570
No, I hear you.
The information is great.

409
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,322
But I'm going to need
another source on it

410
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,075
to confirm her account.

411
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,119
Sure.
Could you email that to me?

412
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,413
Wow, that sounds good.

413
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,997
Yeah.

414
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,083
- It's Lizzi. Okay.
- I'll miss you.

415
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,252
- Yeah.
Sure.

416
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,753
It's okay with me.

417
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,840
If it's okay with Aubrey's mom,
you can sleep over.

418
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,468
Okay. I love you, too.
Bye.

419
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,637
- Did you say "sleep over"?
- Yeah.

420
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,098
- Maybe I could change
my flight.

421
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,392
- Oh, I didn't know
that was an option.

422
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,810
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:20,859
* *

424
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,986
- What?
- The Stones are sexier.

425
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,487
- No, no, no.
- That's it.

426
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,449
- How can you
even compare them?

427
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,826
- I've always thought this,
and I'm not going to apologize.

428
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,202
- "Blackbird," um...

429
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,662
"Martha My Dear,"

430
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,998
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"
"Rocky Raccoon."

431
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,332
- Okay, now we're listing
songs?

432
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,043
- Yeah.
- "Satisfaction"...

433
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,961
- Oh.
- "Gimme Shelter,"

434
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,671
"Sympathy for the Devil."
- No.

435
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,506
No, we can't have
this conversation.

436
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,717
This is terrible.
Now I have to leave you.

437
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,344
- Are you gonna leave me?
- I'm gonna leave you.

438
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,762
- Are you gonna leave me
for The Beatles?

439
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,430
- This is a very, very...
- They're almost--

440
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,474
All of them are dead, almost.
- Important distinction.

441
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,067
- Italian "Vogue,"
nice touch.

442
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,277
- For Lizzi.
- Ah.

443
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:10,367
Hey, Lizzi?
My friend Paolo is here.

444
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,870
- Your "friend"?
- My friend.

445
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:23,338
* *

446
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,216
- "Cacio" means "cheese,"

447
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,136
and "pepe" means "pepper."

448
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,389
So it's like Italian
mac and cheese.

449
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,768
And pepper, you know, "pepe."

450
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,687
- It's delicious, right?

451
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,356
What do you think, kiddo?

452
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,483
- I don't like it.

453
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:48,279
* *

454
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,573
- Your mom tells me
that you play the violin.

455
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,117
- She does, yeah.
- Yeah?

456
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,576
- She practices every day.

457
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,537
Sometimes I don't even have
to ask her to practice.

458
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,706
- Oh, wow.
That's impressive.

459
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,124
It's impressive,

460
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,252
'cause I used to play
the piano when I was your age,

461
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,379
but I hated to practice.

462
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,922
Well, maybe we
can play together.

463
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,258
You--you play the violin,
and I play the piano.

464
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,593
We make a concert for your mom.

465
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,471
* *

466
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:14,889
Mm.

467
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,767
Did you hear what happened
when Johann Sebastian Bach

468
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,811
dropped his violin?

469
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,938
It Baroque.

470
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,857
It Ba-roque.

471
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,775
- Ba-roque, that's funny.

472
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:29,279
- Can I go to my room?
- Lizzi, come on, please.

473
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,990
No, it's okay.

474
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,617
But, Lizzi...

475
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,705
I know that you're feeling
a thousand things right now,

476
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,040
all at once.

477
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:43,001
And I'm ready to wait
for as long as it takes

478
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,087
for you to figure out
how you feel about me.

479
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,756
But I'll make you a deal.

480
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,632
If you let me show you

481
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,844
how much I care about your mom,

482
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,805
I promise you
I will never make you eat

483
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,641
my cacio e pepe again.

484
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,560
Accordo?

485
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,980
* *

486
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,190
- Accordo.

487
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,400
* *

488
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,653
- Good night.

489
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,409
She'll get there.

490
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,994
It takes time.

491
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,372
* *

492
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,664
It's really good.

493
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:22,957
- But you got it, right,
Baroque?

494
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,000
- I got Baroque.
- Okay.

495
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,002
- Yeah, it's a cute joke.

496
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:32,842
* *

497
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:36,971
Hey, three more pages, then
jammies and lights out, okay?

498
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,640
- Okay.

499
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,518
* *

500
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,062
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

501
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,855
- Good night.

502
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,273
- Hey, Mom?

503
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,317
* *

504
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,695
I like his accent.

505
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:55,907
* *

506
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,168
- What? Are you kidding me?
You cooked.

507
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,378
Get out of here.

508
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,971
- What?

509
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,223
- I have bad news.

510
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,517
Our trip to Barcelona--
- No!

511
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,936
- I have to cancel.
- Oh.

512
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,063
- Uh, there's--
there's a new patient

513
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,940
I need to meet in Moscow.

514
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,568
- I was so looking forward
to finally seeing your place.

515
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,403
- I know, my love,
and I'm so sorry,

516
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,779
but if she agrees to surgery,

517
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,032
this could launch funding
for the entire lab.

518
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,491
- No, I-I get it, I get it.

519
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,661
I just, um...

520
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,414
have to figure out what to tell
Kim and everybody else,

521
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,082
'cause I already took time off.

522
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,251
And I have Laura coming
to stay with Lizzi and--

523
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,378
- Why don't you come with me?

524
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,589
- To Russia?
- To Moscow.

525
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,883
I can show you off in Moscow.

526
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,927
I don't know.

527
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:00,096
- Oh, come on, Benita,
I want to spend time with you

528
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,973
without having to hide--please.

529
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,809
- We have to wait
until the special airs

530
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,603
before we tell
anybody anything.

531
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,147
- I'm sure our secret
will be safe in Russia.

532
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,857
Please come with me.

533
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,360
Please, come with me.
- Okay.

534
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,028
I mean, who--

535
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,074
who am I to say no
to the great Dr. Macchiarini.

536
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:23,745
* *

537
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,420
- Accessing the cricoid ring.

538
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:39,636
* *

539
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,555
I see severe infection,
most likely caused

540
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,433
by the excessive radiation
treatments on the patient.

541
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,477
The cartilage is necrotic.

542
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,354
If the tumor hadn't killed him,

543
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,980
it would have been only
a matter of time

544
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:53,149
before he succumbed
to infection.

545
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:57,737
* *

546
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,155
Knife.

547
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,534
* *

548
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,536
Starting resection.

549
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:08,623
The biosynthetic trachea
will fit perfectly

550
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,166
in the resected area.

551
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:17,132
* *

552
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,527
* *

553
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,987
Metzenbaum.

554
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:45,952
* *

555
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:56,463
* *

556
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,256
Okay.

557
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:05,430
* *

558
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:25,241
Okay, switch the oxygen input.

559
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:30,205
* *

560
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,998
Saline.

561
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,502
Any leaks in the trachea will
produce bubbles in the saline.

562
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:38,546
* *

563
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,382
Pulse ox?

564
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,258
- Holding steady.

565
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,095
* *

566
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,097
- No signs of leaking.

567
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:50,850
- Oxygen holding, 98%.

568
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,603
- It's working.

569
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,272
- Congratulations, Doctor.

570
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,817
- Okay, let's close him up.

571
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,111
Doctor?

572
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,487
- BP's dropping.

573
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,531
- He's bleeding.
- Vitals are weakening.

574
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,449
- No, it can't be.
The implant is working.

575
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,743
Where is this blood
coming from?

576
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,954
Doctor?

577
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,872
The left carotid's
most likely ruptured.

578
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,624
- No, I didn't touch it.
I wasn't even near it.

579
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,084
- You said there was
radiation damage.

580
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,293
- Losing OX.

581
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,962
- It must have weakened
the vascular wall.

582
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,630
- Doctor.
- Blood pressure is dropping.

583
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,298
- Doctor, we need to do
something.

584
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,508
- Doctor?
- Losing oxygen.

585
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,051
- Doctor?

586
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,553
Paolo!

587
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:29,639
I can fix this.

588
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,808
- He needs to be stabilized.

589
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,355
- Suction?
- Blood pressure is dropping.

590
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:42,777
* *

591
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,738
- Found it.
Cautery.

592
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:55,206
* *

593
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:02,130
BP is on the rise.

594
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,965
- He's stable.

595
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,218
Sutures for Dr. Macchiarini.

596
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,596
- You should close him.

597
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:32,577
* *

598
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,261
All right, my love, this way.

599
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,763
- I was texting with Lizzi

600
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:53,682
about setting up
our Skype call.

601
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,016
- Mm-hmm?

602
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,102
- And she specifically asked
for you to jump on.

603
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,687
- Oh, she did?
- Yeah.

604
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,897
You charmed her,
you big charmer.

605
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,700
- Pardon me.

606
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,119
Uh, compliments
of the gentleman at the bar.

607
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,916
* *

608
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,376
- Thank you.

609
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:27,757
- To you, to me,
and to ice buckets, always.

610
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,676
Cheers.

611
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:35,724
So who is our benefactor
this evening?

612
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,143
- I shouldn't say.
- Paolo, come on.

613
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,520
I protect sources for a living.

614
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:45,984
- He's a Russian oligarch,
very connected.

615
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,361
No, don't look.

616
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,822
There is a network
of high-profile patients,

617
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:53,783
celebrities, clergy, presidents

618
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,245
that are treated in secret,
that I treat in secret.

619
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,663
Because of who they are,

620
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,791
I have to keep
our arrangement quiet.

621
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:06,046
- Presidents,
like U.S. presidents?

622
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:11,718
- Paolo Macchiarini,
surgeon to the stars?

623
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,346
Okay.

624
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,598
I--Somebody's got
to do it, right?

625
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,725
- Shh, they're coming.
- Oh.

626
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:24,564
- Yulia,
this is Benita Alexander.

627
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:27,984
- Paolo, good to see you.
- It's nice to meet you.

628
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,238
If you're trying
to impress me, Doctor,

629
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,573
it's--it's working.

630
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,950
- Yulia, my dear,
for you, only the best.

631
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,037
- Uh, Paolo tells me
you're a dancer.

632
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,373
The best in Russia.

633
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:44,834
- I met Andrej not long
after I joined the Bolshoi.

634
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,419
- I saw her perform
in "Swan Lake."

635
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,213
She was magnificent.

636
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,882
- I was only part of the corps
de ballet, not the soloist.

637
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,218
- Still, I could not
take my eyes off of her.

638
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:57,514
- While I was on tour
in London a few years ago,

639
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:01,601
I was involved
in a horrible car accident.

640
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,561
- It's a miracle
she's even alive.

641
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,689
- My windpipe was broken.
My...

642
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,524
Everything was broken.

643
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,485
And it left me
with this hole in my neck.

644
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,028
- I'm so sorry.

645
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,740
- The past is a lighthouse,
not a port.

646
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:19,285
I found Dr. Macchiarini.

647
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:22,580
- Up until now,
we have implanted

648
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:24,541
only patients
for compassionate use,

649
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:27,252
those who otherwise would die.

650
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,755
But you have shown me
that quality of life

651
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,925
is nearly as important
as life itself.

652
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,761
- So this is
an elective surgery?

653
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,888
- Yeah.
- Mm.

654
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,182
A part of me

655
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:45,937
hopes it will allow me
to dance again, but, mostly...

656
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:49,607
we have
a two-year-old son, Sasha.

657
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,277
I want to play with him...

658
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,112
Sing him a lullaby.

659
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,156
- And you're
the perfect candidate.

660
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,324
You're young, healthy,

661
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,119
no other medical issues
that would complicate matters.

662
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,288
You-- you're ready.

663
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,290
- Mm. I really don't
want to go to Sweden.

664
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:09,961
I wish you were set up
to operate in Russia.

665
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,131
- Then I have great news
for you.

666
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,759
Our colleague, Dr. Lasbrey,
is setting up facilities

667
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,428
in Krasnodar as we speak.

668
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,806
Your procedure will launch
our work here in Russia, Yulia.

669
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:24,976
You will have
your operation here.

670
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:31,316
- To Dr. Paolo Macchiarini...
- Ah.

671
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,610
- Our rock-star surgeon.

672
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,368
- Mm.

673
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:42,994
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,746
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

675
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,415
* *

676
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,088
- This ballet
was first performed in 1871.

677
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,756
You know--

678
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:57,217
Are you okay?

679
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,511
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, my love.

680
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:02,722
Hey, are you okay?

681
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,766
- I'm sorry.
I don't think I can--

682
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,851
- No, no, no, we'll go home.
No, we'll go. I text you.

683
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,687
No, she's--
I'll text you, okay?

684
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,522
Let's go.
- Are you sure? Should I--

685
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,773
- Yes.
Yeah, yeah.

686
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,651
* *

687
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,069
- You're getting worse.

688
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,029
You should have let me take you
to the hospital.

689
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,281
- No, I just want to lie down.

690
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:27,372
- You're burning up.
- Mm. I feel sick.

691
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,082
- Let me check something.

692
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,837
The surgical site is infected.

693
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,922
- What? There's no way.
That was months ago.

694
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,758
It's got to be healed by now.
- No, it's not.

695
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:46,725
* *

696
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,769
- So--so what,
antibiotics or something?

697
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,397
- No, it's too late for that.

698
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:56,192
You're in sepsis.
I need to debride your wound.

699
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,986
Otherwise,
you will go into shock.

700
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,905
- "Debride"?
What does that mean?

701
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:03,241
You're gonna be okay.

702
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,413
Do you trust me?

703
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,666
* *

704
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,418
- Mm-hmm.

705
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,255
* *

706
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,974
* *

707
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,032
- "Two months
after transplantation,

708
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,742
"the patient is asymptomatic,

709
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,620
"breathes normally,
and is tumor free.

710
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,246
"These results are evidence

711
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,375
"that a successful
organ-regeneration strategy

712

has been accomplished."

713
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,047
"And the procedure's
success provides proof

714
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,007
of the viability
of this approach."

715
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,512
To Dr. Macchiarini,
who dared to make the cut.

716
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:06,721
Cheers.

717
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,223
- To Andemariam Beyene,

718
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:11,184
who bravely risked his life
for science.

719
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:12,394
Cheers.

720
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,978
And last but not least,

721
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,064
to The motherfucking "Lancet"

722
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,733
for publishing
our research article.

723
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,319
Cheers!
- Skol,Anders.

724
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:24,072
- Nathan, tack.

725
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,990
- So published
in "The Lancet"--

726
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,702
you're halfway to a Nobel.

727
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,161
This is shit.

728
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:32,247
You'd think they would have
sprung for better bubbly.

729
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,208
- Then feel free
to steal someone else's.

730
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,086
- Fantastic.
- Cheers.

731
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:39,963
- I'm surprised
to see you here,

732
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,881
knowing how you feel
about Dr. Macchiarini.

733
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,758
- Well, free champagne
is free champagne--

734
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,093
or whatever this is.
- Of course.

735
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,971
- You must all be
on cloud nine.

736
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,264
- I'm excited, of course,

737
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,974
though I also have
the feeling of--

738
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:53,226
What do you call it?
Impostor's syndrome.

739
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,352
- Why?

740
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,104
You're running
Macchiarini's rat trials.

741
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:59,024
- Which are still in progress.

742
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:01,401
Macchiarini included
my name in the byline,

743
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:04,988
but I have yet to submit
my results.

744
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,449
- Welcome to the world
of scientific publishing.

745
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,617
As I recall someone
once saying,

746
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,953
"Competition fuels progress."

747
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:26,551
* *

748
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,029
- Okay.
- Here we go.

749
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,031
Watch out for the chair.

750
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:50,283
Yeah, but I can't
watch anything.

751
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,743
Okay.

752
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,454
- Okay, you can open your eyes.
- No.

753
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,040
- You said you wanted
to start playing again.

754
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,958
- We can do a duet.
- Wow.

755
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,044
Yeah, we can do a duet.

756
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,879
This is incredible.
Thank you.

757
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,714
Careful with your stitches.
- Aw.

758
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,466
- Love, come here.

759
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:09,302
Thank you so much.
Wow, this is so cool.

760
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,388
But first, I have to
remember how to play.

761
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,765
- Oh, let me get my phone.
- This is so cool.

762
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,393
Thank you.

763
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,565
* *

764
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:31,950
* *

765
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:36,329
- * Knowing I'll be missing *

766
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:40,917
* Christmas Eve
in my hometown *

767
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,004
- Thank you.
- Mm.

768
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,755
- Are you okay?

769
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,925
- Yeah.
Christmas, family...

770
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,553
holidays, you know?

771
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,930
- It makes you sad?

772
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:56,641
- Not really, not this year.

773
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,518
We feel like a family.

774
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,732
- You read my mind.

775
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,066
Lizzi.

776
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:08,778
- Wait.
Hold on.

777
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,032
What--what is going on?
This feels like collusion.

778
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:16,745
* *

779
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:19,456
* Through dreams
and just pretending *

780
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:23,293
* I'm there,
and I'll be spending *

781
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,546
* Christmas Eve
in my hometown *

782
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,548
- What do you say, Mom?

783
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,135
- What do you say?

784
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,388
- * In my hometown *

785
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:41,519
* *

786
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,152
- Hey, come in.
- Hello.

787
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,613
- Hi.
Please come in.

788
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,782
Look...

789
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,243
Mr. Beyene sent it.

790
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:58,745
- Oh.

791
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,169
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yeah.

792
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,755
- I wish our work
always ended like that.

793
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:11,007
- Yes.

794
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:13,176
Thank you
for sharing that with me.

795
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:16,012
- Sometimes it's nice
to be reminded why we--

796
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,932
- Sacrifice.

797
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,642
- So you, too?

798
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:24,354
- Oh, you know, nothing big--
just girlfriends, children,

799
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,147
probably a few years
off my life.

800
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:29,192
- Well, maybe we can build
something together

801
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:32,112
that will make it
all worthwhile.

802
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,947
- I think we can.

803
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,826
- The funding
for our transplant research

804
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,369
is about to run out.

805
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,871
- I'm sure "The Lancet" article
garnered some attention.

806
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:43,873
- Yes, we can capitalize
on that momentum

807
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:45,834
to secure a new grant,

808
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,169
which will lead
to more surgeries

809
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:50,839
and to more money.

810
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,174
- Around and around.

811
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:55,677
- Until we can expand...

812
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,054
globally.

813
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:01,474
The goal is six operations
within the next three months.

814
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:08,064
- You can produce that many
custom tracheas in that time?

815
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:11,234
- Yes, it can be done.

816
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,987
But we need more patients.

817
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,531
- Then let's find
more patients.

818
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:23,496
* *
