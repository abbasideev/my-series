1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,433
BP's dropping.

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,435
- He's bleeding.
- I can fix this.

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,354
Can you believe it?
It's finally fucking happening.

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,815
Yulia's tracheas,
they're defective.

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,191
Sorry.

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,818
Just wait
a little bit longer.

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,528
Okay.

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,865
<i>You were right about him,
about all of it.</i>

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,575
Andy Beyene.

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,201
He just died.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,829
<i>I wanna see it--his trachea.</i>

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>I wanna see it
with my own eyes.</i>

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,875
Now, when you remember
this day,

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,544
will you feel shame?

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,629
<i>Don't have a solution.
Welded wrong.</i>

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>Clearly not working.</i>

17
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,594
<i>I don't have a solution.</i>

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,095
<i>Welded wrong.</i>

19
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,222
<i>We have to change
the material.</i>

20
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>Clearly not working.</i>

21
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,478
<i>What of the ones
we used on Mr. Beyene?</i>

22
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,582
The endoluminal surface
is barren.

23
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,668
We should be seeing anastomosis,

24
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,253
blood vessels developing
around the implant.

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,255
It looks like
the trachea ate away

26
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,591
at the surrounding cartilage.

27
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,259
Here, take a sample
of the tissue

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,428
near the left main bronchus.

29
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,850
Oh, holy--

30
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,269
That's advanced degeneration. Necrosis.

31
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,729
We'll test it.

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,940
You test it all you want.
That is rotting flesh.

33
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,775
I tend to agree.

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,153
I see no evidence
of vascularized neomucosas.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,114
This is--this is gross.

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,115
Stay with us, man.

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,574
Just be quick, please.

38
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,119
We need to be out
before the morning shift.

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,371
- Shh.
- Hmm?

40
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,835
Okay, go.

41
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,133
The stem cells,
they were supposed to--

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,886
they were supposed
to come alive.

43
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,973
It's a bad time to find
enlightenment, Lasbrey.

44
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,182
Come on, let's go.

45
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,642
Anders, breathe.

46
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,687
I'm good. I'm fine.
I'm totally fine.

47
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,148
Nate, look.

48
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,525
It's barely attached.

49
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,194
He coughed
the damn thing loose.

50
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,321
How the hell was he breathing?

51
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,787
Oh.

52
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,292
All right, pal.

53
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,878
Just keep an eye on that door.

54
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,546
Hedley's already got
a hard-on for us.

55
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,423
The last thing we need
is for him to find out

56
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,799
we went behind--
- Wait, wait, wait.

57
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,556
Ah, shit.

58
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>Ah.</i>

59
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,318
<i>Yahoo.
Can you go like this?</i>

60
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,945
Like that?
And then.

61
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>Macchiarini.
Did you see the email?</i>

62
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,328
<i>Yeah, we've worked around
the clock for--</i>

63
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,373
<i>we still don't have
a solution.</i>

64
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>The material because these
are clearly not working.</i>

65
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,554
<i>Are clearly not working.</i>

66
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,139
<i>To change the material
because these--</i>

67
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,849
<i>clearly not working.</i>

68
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,023
I got you,
you son of a bitch.

69
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,650
Yo, time's up, toots.

70
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,901
No, no, no,
I found something.

71
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,528
You said
you needed two hours.

72
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,154
You're rounding up to six.
- Yeah, yeah, but hold on.

73
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,072
Hold on.
- You gotta get out of here

74
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,156
before the morning shift.

75
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,741
Listen.

76
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,576
<i>Yeah, we've worked around
the clock for two weeks,</i>

77
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,120
<i>and we still don't have
a solution.</i>

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>And I'm very unhappy.</i>

79
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,581
<i>When I felt the tracheas,</i>

80
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,125
<i>they were
completely welded wrong.</i>

81
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,543
<i>They dried out too quickly.</i>

82
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>They were like the ones
we used on Mr. Beyene.</i>

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,006
<i>Yes, I mean, definitely,
we have to change the material</i>

84
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,134
<i>because these are
clearly not working.</i>

85
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,136
His tracheas don't work.

86
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,555
They don't work,
and he knew, Kim.

87
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,641
B, you don't work,
not here, not anymore.

88
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,601
They don't work, and he kept
putting them in people,

89
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,231
in real people,
in Hannah Warren.

90
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,735
I thought it was just me,
but it's his patients too.

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,903
Fuck, Kim, the fog. The fog.

92
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,488
This is the way out.

93
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,198
I have to expose him.

94
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,325
Okay, you can expose him
all over the place,

95
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,369
but right now, the "Today Show"
people are coming in,

96
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,787
and if anyone sees you--

97
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,372
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what time is it?

98
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,999
Oh, shit.

99
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,959
I gotta go. I gotta go.

100
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,545
Sorry. Sorry.
Thank you so much.

101
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,806
- Wanna run the noble gases?
- Nah, I got it.

102
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
Lizzi!

103
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,643
Sorry, guys,
I don't know what happened.

104
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,062
One minute it was midnight,
and the next--

105
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,480
Mom, it's fine.

106
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,231
Your hair looks
really cute today.

107
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,358
Did you finish your homework,

108
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,942
'cause I could check it
for you before--

109
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,737
oh, honey, I know it's your day
to bring snacks,

110
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,365
so I got a whole assortment
of different muffins and--

111
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,574
We picked up some on the way.

112
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,784
- Oh.
- Sorry.

113
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,243
No, no, no, no, no,
that's great.

114
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,871
I appreciate it.

115
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,831
Bye, love.

116
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,167
Mom! Mom!

117
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,169
Sorry. Sorry. Okay.

118
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,214
Go ahead and give the extras
to your teachers or classmates

119
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,965
or whatever.

120
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,176
All right. Phone?

121
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,344
Keys?

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,653
<i>Look, this is
completely unacceptable.</i>

123
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,073
<i>This is why we have protocols.</i>

124
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,868
<i>You're the head of security.
You tell me how it happened.</i>

125
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,204
<i>I don't care what was signed.</i>

126
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,127
Was it worth it?

127
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,392
Oh, the entire posterior
quadrant is ruptured.

128
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,936
Trachea ate its way
right through his goddamn neck.

129
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,938
We have the samples

130
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,398
I smuggled out
from the autopsy.

131
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,066
I can run
most of the tests myself,

132
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,152
but some I need
to send out to the labs.

133
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,404
We should have results
within a few weeks.

134
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,490
Sure.

135
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,992
Is it Hedley?

136
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,994
He can threaten disciplinary
action all he wants.

137
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,495
We have the science
on our side.

138
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,663
No, it's not Hedley.

139
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,542
It's just this--
it's all too familiar.

140
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,669
Yesim.

141
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,715
Ah. Any word?

142
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,925
She made it through
her transplant in the U.S.

143
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,094
Donor lung, donor trachea.

144
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,140
But after everything
she's been through--

145
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,941
Tracheas were
just the beginning.

146
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,027
We had more organs
ready to go--

147
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,405
animal testing, prototypes,
all of it.

148
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,324
- Where?
- Russia.

149
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,535
In a lab overseen by you.

150
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,912
I'm here now.

151
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,289
Yeah, and your sudden urge
to give back

152
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,166
is truly inspiring.

153
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,296
"Two months after transplantation,

154
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,215
"the patient is asymptomatic,

155
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,592
breathes normally,
and is tumor free."

156
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,720
Anders, this is
what we published.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,764
Our names are on this.

158
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,644
After what we just saw...
we have to expose him.

159
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,940
How many papers
has Macchiarini published

160
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,566
since his time at Karolinska?

161
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,944
Six,
with more in the pipeline.

162
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,282
Uh...

163
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,705
No, that's fine.
Just use my wall.

164
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,334
Macchiarini used
these publications

165
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,502
to build his name.

166
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,421
Perhaps they'll lead
to his ruin.

167
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,381
Six papers, three patients

168
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:31,428
from here on out known
as patients A, B--

169
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,971
Ah!

170
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,389
Sorry.

171
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,141
We'll repaint it later.

172
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,726
C.

173
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,436
We'll write our own paper.

174
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,229
A report

175
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,940
contrasting the results
Paolo released

176
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,443
with his patients'
actual clinical outcomes.

177
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,863
We show the discrepancies,
show that he knew, proving--

178
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,323
Fabrications. Falsifications.

179
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,492
Scientific misconduct
at the very least.

180
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:58,204
And we walk this straight
to the board of directors.

181
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,457
This implicates
Karolinska as well.

182
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,000
They'll try to bury it.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,918
Yeah, and dig three more
holes while they're at it.

184
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,295
They'll crucify us.

185
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,380
Not if we do this
by the book.

186
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,882
We keep the patient anonymous.

187
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,508
We'll need permission
from the families,

188
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,801
access to their files--

189
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,845
Karolinska will make
our lives miserable.

190
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,929
Hedley warned us.

191
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,558
Fuck it.

192
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,851
We see this through.

193
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,815
You wanna blow the whistle
on one of the most powerful

194
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,902
medical institutions
in the world.

195
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,532
Well, I'd rather take a bullet
to the back of the head

196
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,535
than get one of those tracheas.

197
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,496
All right, let's go,
before Macchiarini adds

198
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,082
another letter to our alphabet.

199
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,976
Open your eyes.

200
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,437
Yulia.

201
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,277
Welcome back.

202
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,411
Can you speak?

203
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,121
Say something.

204
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,335
Is--is it--

205
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,006
The operation is a success.

206
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,223
See, I told you.

207
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,851
I told you
it would go perfectly.

208
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,521
Aren't you glad
that you changed your mind?

209
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:50,608
Is it--

210
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,986
is it working?

211
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,530
Of course it's working.

212
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,454
Something's not right.

213
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,205
It hurts.

214
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,002
You have to remain calm, Yulia.

215
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,172
It will help you heal faster.

216
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:17,469
Yulia, everything is fine.

217
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:26,269
Will I be able
to play with my son?

218
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,355
Yes.

219
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,233
Everything is
as it should be, my dear.

220
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,902
Everything.

221
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,418
Paolo Macchiarini
is a con artist.

222
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,922
Google him, and you'll find
a sea of good press,

223
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,758
good intentions, a miracle man.

224
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,052
But it's all just a con.

225
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,598
This is a story
about who he really is,

226
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,226
and the more I learned
about him,

227
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,020
the more questions I had.

228
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,273
He left a trail of bodies
behind him

229
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,401
from Italy to London.

230
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,945
Before that,
it was Hanover, Germany.

231
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:17,946
Paris, France.

232
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,739
Every two or three years,

233
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,324
he suddenly relocates his work.

234
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,951
Why?

235
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,703
He's running,

236
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,287
trying to distance himself
from the lies

237
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,666
he leaves behind him.

238
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,217
House arrest--
charges of bribery,

239
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,886
extortion,
except none of them stick.

240
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,765
And it all comes back to this
little piece of plastic,

241
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,893
this little piece of plastic
that turns into a windpipe,

242
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,229
but none of it's true.

243
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,856
Here, here, listen to this.

244
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,400
<i>Used on Mr. Beyene.</i>

245
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,819
<i>Yeah, well, definitely,
we have to change the material</i>

246
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,948
<i>because these are
clearly not working.</i>

247
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,075
That man that he's
talking about in the video,

248
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,661
Mr. Beyene, died.

249
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,622
But Dr. Macchiarini
keeps on operating.

250
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,042
And I'll admit I bought
into this fiction myself.

251
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,336
I wanted to believe that he was
a man who could perform

252
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,463
all of these miracles,

253
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,842
but Paolo Macchiarini is
more mirage than man.

254
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,344
And this story proves

255
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,681
just how deadly
a mirage can be.

256
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,146
There's a story here,
all right.

257
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,481
I told you.

258
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,733
But it's not the one
you're selling.

259
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,572
Back in Detroit,
you and me and John,

260
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,658
we had quite the little rivalry
going, didn't we?

261
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,204
A three-way tug-of-war,
and you, you were merciless.

262
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,247
When you had a story,
you had a story.

263
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,583
You weren't sharing it,
let alone giving it away.

264
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,752
All these years, Percy,
and you really haven't gotten

265
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,545
any better at getting
to your point, have you?

266
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,880
Like I said,
there's a story here,

267
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,715
and there's a reason
you're bringing it to me,

268
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,009
to anyone, for that matter,
same reason you don't have

269
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,596
half the 27th floor
of 30 Rock on this right now.

270
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,183
I feel like this is
a much stronger written piece,

271
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,601
and with your magazine
behind it,

272
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,229
I know we could--
- Bullshit.

273
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,980
You're neglecting your lead.

274
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,777
You, with this guy,
that's the story I'd publish.

275
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,696
Yeah, I don't know
what you heard,

276
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,115
but I have not--
- Okay, okay, fine, fine.

277
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,741
Let's break down
what you're pitching.

278
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,703
Synthetic tracheas,
no one gives a synthetic fuck.

279
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,122
Stem cells, people are either
for 'em or against 'em.

280
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,248
They don't wanna read
about 'em.

281
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,791
He's--he's killing people.

282
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,418
Maybe, but at the end
of the day,

283
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,253
you don't have any proof
of what you're claiming.

284
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,963
Like you said,
a sea of good press

285
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,423
is all that I'm seeing.

286
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:45,885
Maybe no one has the balls
to print anything else.

287
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,264
This version of the story
is too complicated,

288
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,683
too medical.

289
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,519
We need a road
into this world, Benita,

290
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,604
and that boulevard is you.

291
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,898
Don't go there.

292
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,775
It's the only place to go.

293
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,820
Deception, crossed lines,
secret affairs--

294
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,115
I mean, that's the through line
to this other sciencey shit.

295
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,950
Am I wrong?

296
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,037
You wanna expose him, you said.

297
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,246
- Yes.
- To save lives.

298
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,706
Yes. That's what this is.

299
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,958
I have
a journalistic responsibility

300
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,460
to tell this story.

301
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,878
It doesn't seem
you were too worried

302
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,547
about your journalistic
responsibility before.

303
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,305
Thank you
for your time, Percy.

304
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,113
Okay, let's review complications.

305
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,573
Tussis.

306
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,950
- Patient A, yes.
- Patient B, yes.

307
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,995
Patient C...yes.

308
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,499
You spelled sepsis wrong.

309
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,501
What? No, I didn't.

310
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,835
Is that a P?

311
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,962
Don't worry about me.

312
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,631
Worry about patient A.

313
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,591
This is going to be hell.

314
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,514
Okay,
tracheoesophageal fistula.

315
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,724
Patient A, yes.

316
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,142
B, yes.

317
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,852
C, yes.

318
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,942
Hey, Dr. Lakshmi,
I'm having flashbacks

319
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,318
to JV basketball here.

320
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,653
I'm sorry?

321
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,571
I can't seem to find
my name on the roster.

322
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,824
Nothing for you this week.

323
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,326
You've got me working six-day
shifts without any surgery?

324
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,995
So I'm, what, changing IVs?

325
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,664
Perhaps you can
help your colleagues

326
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,332
with their paperwork.

327
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,672
They're sticking us
in the rubber room.

328
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,924
It's not what it sounds like.

329
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,010
I've been on call
120 hours straight,

330
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,970
and all I'm doing is
other doctors' paperwork.

331
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,763
I'm clocking 110.

332
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,682
Honestly, I'm surprised
they even let me touch a case

333
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,891
since I came back from Russia.

334
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,060
I'm not touching cases,
only case files.

335
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,562
I haven't done a surgery.

336
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,980
I haven't done an intake.

337
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,482
I haven't seen a patient's face
in weeks.

338
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,698
I received notice today
my emails are under audit.

339
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,199
What does that mean?

340
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,868
They're tracing back
through every email

341
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,704
I've sent and received
over the last two years.

342
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,623
I expect you two will be
receiving the same request.

343
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,876
What are they looking for?

344
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,671
Slip-ups, mistakes, breaches
in patient confidentiality,

345
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,716
whatever they can find
to justify our dismissal.

346
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,219
All this extra scrutiny,
the unending hours...

347
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,513
They're trying to break us.

348
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,182
Is it working?

349
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,145
The sooner
we complete our report,

350
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,939
the sooner we can get back
to our regular work.

351
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:52,947
Patient A, tracheal materials
were made from POSS-PCU.

352
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,326
But Paolo found the initial
materials to be too dry,

353
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,912
so patient B was pure PET.

354
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,330
Time-out.

355
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,791
Pure PET?

356
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,460
Where are the trials
to back that up?

357
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,883
You switched materials
between Beyene and Lyles

358
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,970
without any prior testing
in place?

359
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,683
We switched materials
with every patient.

360
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,076
- B?
- Yes.

361
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,984
More tea?

362
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,987
No, I do not want
hot plant water.

363
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,364
The fuck do you think
coffee is?

364
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,283
Who keeps opening the window?

365
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,660
It's 30 degrees in here.
I need air.

366
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,245
If it's 30 degrees, then--

367
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,621
Don't make a Celsius joke.

368
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,873
You should be cold.

369
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,374
Oh, my God,
you live in Europe.

370
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,834
You live in Europe.

371
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,961
Sweet baby Jesus,
my seven-year-old is

372
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,546
better behaved than you two.

373
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,381
He's so stubborn.
It's ridiculous.

374
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,549
Oh, no, she just gets pissed

375
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,508
when she doesn't get
what she wants.

376
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,718
Nathan, stop.

377
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,886
You've been difficult enough
on her.

378
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,471
Why are you always
sticking up for her?

379
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,680
She's the reason
we're in this shit.

380
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,806
What's done is done.

381
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,600
We can't continue on like this.

382
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,354
Thank God.

383
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,688
Hello.

384
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,733
We need to get
out of this apartment.

385
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,992
That can't be.

386
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,452
What can't be?

387
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,413
I had Macchiarini's
stem cell solution tested.

388
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,917
The lab found elevated traces
of TGF beta 3.

389
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,460
No, that's a mistake.

390
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,087
It's right here in the labs.

391
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,254
What is it?

392
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,714
It's a growth factor.

393
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,758
But it's barred for use
outside of the lab.

394
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,386
- It's a known carcinogenic.
- Jesus.

395
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,263
Who on ethical approval board
would have allowed this?

396
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,973
They were probably all
just as blinded

397
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,226
by the miracle man
as everyone else.

398
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,395
They have no idea
what they approved.

399
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,276
<i>Ministry of Health.
How can I help you?</i>

400
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,487
Hi, yes, I'd like
to speak to someone

401
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,324
in permits and approvals.

402
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,411
Yes, I'm--I'm looking
for an application

403
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,706
for ethical permission.

404
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,959
Dr. Paolo Macchiarini
out of Karolinska.

405
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:57,757
No, that can't--are you sure?

406
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,761
Where are you located?

407
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,932
To the Karolinska

408
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:12,313
Board of Directors,

409
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,568
we hereby request--

410
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,611
No, demand.

411
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,363
No.

412
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,700
We hereby demand a inq--

413
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,702
Investigation.

414
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,455
No.

415

An investi--

416
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,083
Do you want me to type?

417
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,502
When I'm in need
of numerous typos,

418
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,421
I'll be sure to let you know.

419
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,006
Investiga--

420
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:41,760
I would have chosen
a different font, but whatever.

421
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,138
What--

422
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,474
...gation.

423
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,523
<i>"It is our opinion

424
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,150

00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,162
"We have analyzed

"The claim that a synthetic

"We found

falsified information."

"That crucial data

438
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,858
There was
no ethical approval.

439
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,986
- What?
- He never applied.

440
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,406
Didn't even try.
He just skipped it.

441
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,865
That's impossible.

442
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,618
You can't--that's--
that's the first step.

443
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,453
You can't conduct studies--

444
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,831
that's--that's felony.

445
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,873
You can't--

446
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,794
You can't, but he did.

447
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,423
Everything he did
to those people,

448
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,466
everything I did--

449
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,944
Can I have a drag?

450
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,742
Actually, I don't smoke.

451
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,118
Neither should you.

452
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,911
What's the matter with you?

453
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,372
I started back up in Russia.

454
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,999
Vodka and cigarettes.

455
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,669
Only way to stay warm--
stay numb.

456
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,963
- Hey, so--
- Don't.

457
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:52,807
I keep thinking about Beyene
on the table.

458
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,603
I saved him.

459
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,313
My first operation with Paolo,

460
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,733
and everything went wrong
until I stepped in.

461
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,401
I was brilliant.

462
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:07,155
I spent days studying
the science, his physiology.

463
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,158
I hear it's called preparing.

464
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:19,292
Maybe it would have been
better if he died.

465
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,544
Then none of this
would have happened.

466
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,176
How can I still call myself
a doctor

467
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,137
when I think like that?

468
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:42,440
There was a moment
in the OR with Yesim.

469
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,611
All those surgeries--

470
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,573
I started to lose track
that she was real.

471
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:57,956
We're all animals
after a while.

472
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:01,418
Body parts, organs, meat.

473
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,838
I couldn't shake the feeling

474
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,883
that I was
some kind of butcher.

475
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:14,222
And I...pushed things further.

476
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,267
I crossed lines
that I didn't ever think I--

477
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:25,066
The more I tried to save her,
the less I could.

478
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:28,236
None of it had
anything to do with him.

479
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:35,076
We all get lost
in the dark, Ana.

480
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,536
And there will be time
to grieve,

481
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,705
you know, to figure out
how to forgive ourselves,

482
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:42,876
but what we're doing,

483
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:46,379
this could help
set things right.

484
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,257
But in order to do that,
we need you with us.

485
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,061
Got a minute?

486
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,777
How's school?

487
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,488
You guys still working
on the periodic table?

488
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,744
They didn't invent some magical
new element to rewind time,

489
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,079
did they?

490
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,291
'Cause there's a few things
I would do differently.

491
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,462
Okay.

492
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,386
You know, we are gonna
talk about this, right?

493
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:37,639
Maybe not tonight, maybe...

494
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,809
at some point,
we're gonna talk about it.

495
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,269
I know these last few months
have been really hard.

496
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,563
And I'm sorry, but I'm trying.

497
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:50,360
It's just--it's not easy
to untangle your--

498
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,404
Papa?

499
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,780
Mom--

500
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,117
Mom, give it back.
- He's been texting you months?

501
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,201
I don't--
I don't even answer.

502
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,786
- Lizzi--
- Please--

503
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,413
How could you talk to him
after everything he did to us?

504
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,123
I don't even text back.
Give it.

505
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,624
Okay. Nope, sorry.
You lost your phone.

506
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,209
You lost your laptop.
You lost your iPad.

507
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:07,669
It's all mine now.
- Mom, you can't do that!

508
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,045
Yes, I can do that.

509
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,505
None of what he's saying
is true.

510
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,965
They're all lies.

511
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,342
So?
All you ever do is lie to me.

512
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,177
I lie to you?
How do I lie to you?

513
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,972
Well, about Dad,
about how sick he was.

514
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,265
And you lied to Kim.

515
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,975
You think I don't see
this stuff?

516
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,393
Mom, I'm not blind.
I know you did.

517
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,479
All he ever did was lie.

518
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,441
Every goddamn word out
of his mouth was a lie, Lizzi.

519
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,984
You think he cared about you?

520
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,652
You think you're special? No.

521
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,529
He's got women
all over the world.

522
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,614
He's got little Lizzis
all over the world.

523
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,241
You're not special.

524
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,869
We were never special.

525
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,934
Well, no turning back now.

526
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,815
I'll make the personal delivery
to Hedley's door.

527
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,290
You're a very gifted doctor.

528
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,125
There will be
other opportunities

529
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,712
far away from the polar circle.

530
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,798
I was the right hand
to a fraud.

531
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,510
My most notable paper
is a sham.

532
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,054
No serious institution
will ever touch me.

533
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,182
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

534
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:50,188
How many researchers publish
a revolutionary thesis,

535
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,773
then succeed it
with a new treatise

536
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,401
that's designed to dismantle
that very thesis?

537
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,988
It shows versatility.

538
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,990
Huh?

539
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,958
This will make a difference.

540
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,293
It has to make a difference.

541
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:22,387
My last patient in Russia
was a young mother.

542
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,305
Her name's Yulia.

543
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,433
He was going to put
one of those in her.

544
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,897
I convinced her to wait
before I left.

545
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,238
Wherever she is, this Yulia
owes you a debt of gratitude.

546
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:42,198
You didn't just save a life.

547
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,994
You saved her from a fate
worse than death.

548
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:12,562
Gentlemen, we have had
a tremendous breakthrough

549
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,440
that will help us
not only to enhance one's life

550
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,401
but to extend it.

551
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,070
Here she is.

552
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,574
May I present
the beautiful Yulia Tuulik,

553
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:28,036
the very first recipient
of a bioartificial implant

554
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,245
here at this facility,

555
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,082
and with
your generous new grant,

556
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,209
the first of many to come.

557
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,795
Yulia.

558
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:40,256
Here.

559
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,932
Death came for Yulia
after a tragic accident,

560
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,017
but little did death know

561
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,228
that he messed
with the wrong Russian.

562
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:03,738
Oh, gentlemen, come on.
You're making her afraid.

563
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:06,741
I'm not afraid of anyone.

564
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,204
Mama.

565
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,248
- Sasha.
- Mama.

566
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,547
See? This.

567
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,049
This is why I became a surgeon.

568
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,470
Through all the delays,
through all the setbacks,

569
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,517
moments like this
keep me going.

570
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,310
And I promise you I--

571
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,354
I will never stop.

572
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,523
Andre.

573
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,414
This man hurt
a lot of people,

574
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,750
and they deserve the truth.

575
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,711
My daughter deserves
to know the truth.

576
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,509
So I'll give you the story.

577
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,427
But you leave her
out of it, all right?

578
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,430
Lizzi is off-limits.

579
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:07,696
Paolo loved
playing the martyr,

580
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,782
the selfless doctor

581
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:14,786
who was, you know, so busy,
so caring, so lonely

582
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,329
without a bed to call his own.

583
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,290
But it couldn't have been
that much of a surprise.

584
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,750
Meaning?

585
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,253
There were plenty of signs--

586
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,672
your wedding, celebrities.

587
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,965
I mean, drown me in wine,

588
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,466
you could maybe feed me
that one,

589
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,176
but the Pope?

590
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,220
I did my homework.
It happened before.

591
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,180
For two divorcées,
a non-Catholic?

592
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,308
Paolo knew people
at the Vatican.

593
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,562
You still believe that.

594
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,565
It's so easy
sitting in that chair,

595
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,609
never believing
it could happen to you.

596
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,988
Paolo could make
any person in any room

597
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,948
feel like they were
the most important soul

598
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,117
in the entire world to him.

599
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:57,203
It's a really wonderful gift
for a doctor

600
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,873
and a potent weapon.

601
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,584
Once someone believes that
you mean something to them,

602
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,210
they just let their guard down.

603
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,879
They trust you.

604
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,549
That's why so many of Paolo's
patients trusted him.

605
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,635
And why you trusted him

606
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,764
that night
at the Russian hotel.

607
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:21,603
- I never told you about that.
- He operated on you.

608
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,813
He probably saved your life.

609
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,233
You talked to him.

610
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,696
I'm obligated to get
both sides of the story.

611
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:34,699
You know that.

612
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,869
He said you contacted him
from the ER

613
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,121
when you had your episode.

614
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,752
Of all your friends,
your colleagues,

615
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,087
you chose to call him.

616
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,630
Why?

617
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:55,762
I was scared.

618
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:01,434
And I felt really vulnerable
'cause I had just lost John.

619
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,396
Paolo made you feel safe.

620
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,773
At the time, he did, yeah.

621
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:10,652
You loved him.

622
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,071
I did.

623
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:16,574
He offered you
security, stability,

624
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:20,412
then he took it away,

625
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,871
just like your father.

626
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,961
Excuse me?

627
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,296
He kicked you out,
your father,

628
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,967
right after your mother
ran out on your family.

629
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,969
It's understandable
why a man like Paolo

630
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,762
would fill a paternal void
for you.

631
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,973
But then he turns out
to be just the same.

632
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,642
Man after man,
betrayal after betrayal,

633
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:45,895
after all that, one can imagine
you might want some revenge.

634
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:48,356
Go fuck yourself, Percy.

635
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,111
Any intern doing
a five-minute background on you

636
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,654
would find this,
and you're smart enough

637
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,656
to know that.

638
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,045
Ana.

639
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,884
Paolo.

640
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:29,064
I'm so happy to see you.

641
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,234
I have to admit
that your departure

642
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,195
was a complete surprise for me.

643
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,868
I just feared I would never
have the chance to thank you

644
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,661
for everything you've done.

645
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,372
I--

646
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:50,669
I've encountered
many surgeons over the years,

647
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,671
but you?

648
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:59,094
You possess something that gets
driven out of most doctors.

649
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,600
Imagination.

650
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,686
Oh, yes, you do.

651
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:11,231
I realized that
the moment we met

652
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,858
because you reminded me of me.

653
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,277
I'm nothing like you.

654
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,906
I read your report.

655
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,495
<i>You and your partners crafted
quite a page-turner.</i>

656
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,750
<i>I'm just surprised that you
would go so far to undermine</i>

657
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,921
<i>what you and I built together,</i>

658
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,675
after all
that you have sacrificed.

659
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,886
But that's why I'm here today.

660
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,097
Karolinska has given me

661
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:47,434
the time
to refute these allegations,

662
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,686
the opportunity
to defend my name.

663
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:52,272
To defend what, a lie?

664
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:56,276
That's all it ever was,
and you know it.

665
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,903
I always thought
you understood.

666
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,156
Why else would you cheat?

667
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,615
Why else wouldn't you seek--

668
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,409
Ethical approval?

669
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:11,332
Because my surgeries were vital
to saving patients' lives.

670
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,461
A loophole.

671
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,964
Loophole?

672
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:21,176
Our entire history is
built on loopholes.

673
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,888
On lines that we must be
willing to cross

674
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,765
so that we can give
desperate people a chance

675
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,976
when no one else will.

676
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:33,271
That's compassionate use.

677
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,898
There is nothing compassionate

678
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,983
about what you do.

679
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:43,114
You know, I meant to tell you

680
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:46,326
Yulia sends her greetings.

681
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:51,164
She's doing exceptionally well.

682
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:54,084
She's back home
in St. Petersburg

683
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,920
with her family...

684
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,089
with her new trachea.

685
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,093
No.

686
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,471
You almost had her convinced,

687
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,972
but luckily,
she changed her mind

688
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,599
before it was too late.

689
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,398
Dr. Lasbrey, we have
a few questions for you.

690
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,275
Would you come with us, please?

691
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:25,865
Ciao, Ana.

692
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,097
<i>It was a mistake.</i>

693
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,849
<i>I don't know
what I was even thinking,</i>

694
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,019
<i>why I thought this would work.</i>

695
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,688
<i>We've seen it happen
over and over.</i>

696
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:59,733
<i>People who try to speak out,
to tell the truth...</i>

697
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,903
<i>They're the ones who suffer
in the end.</i>

698
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,579
<i>Heads down, mouths shut.</i>

699
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,123
<i>That's the moral
of the fucking story.</i>

700
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,732
<i>The system is rigged.</i>

701
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:45,028
<i>Good people,
they learn to stay silent.</i>

702
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:49,741
<i>And men like Paolo, they win.</i>

703
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:57,665
<i>- Not always.
- Maybe.</i>

704
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,503
But this time.

705
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,921
<i>You want me to come over?</i>

706
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,464
No.

707
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,926
I think I need to be
by myself right now.

708
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,678
<i>Okay. Try to get some sleep.</i>

709
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,179
Okay.
