That boy will distract you from your son.

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,321
[Joe] I can't cage what's inside of me.

5
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,450
Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,493
but make sure it knows the rules.

7
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,080
So now I have you, Marienne.

Okay.

[Joe] Here's what I've learned about you
in the last few days, Marienne.

15
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,013
You like things that make you feel.

16
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:41,810
You're whimsical and artsy. You don't like
things that go together too perfectly.

17
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,687
You find beauty in the flaws.

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,523
Unexpected pairings.

19
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:51,110
You're deep, reverent, rooted,

20
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,114
yet adventurous.

21
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,453
You're at home in chaos,
but something tells me not by choice.

You take care of books
and art and young minds,

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,507
but who takes care of you?

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,680
No. No, no, no. This is not why I'm here.

26
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,892
I'm here, well,
to figure out why I'm here.

27
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,520
Why you, Marienne?

28
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,150
So I must leave everything as I found it.

29
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,781
I like following you.
You're interesting and unpredictable.

30
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,535
And that inner part of me
that needs this is mostly satiated,

31
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,372
but in the spirit of self-awareness
and maybe conquering that inner thing,

32
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,915
I ask again,

33
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,334

out of your routine?

pegging someone on this bed. RIP Peach.

00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,251
Wanna take a look?

177
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,089
-Help yourself.
-Oh.

178
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,594
Bottom-line it, anything remotely
interesting in all this guy's work?

179
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,556
One thing that's interesting to me
is your neighbor, the baker,

180
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,516
Quinn of the L.A. Quinns,

181
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,353
meaning she probably has her own PIs
who know what you're up to.

182
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,608
And the most litigious father this side
of Republicans whining for a recount.

183
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,943
Except Ray Quinn, he wins.

184
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,113
-I haven't broken any laws.
-A look this bad should be illegal.

185
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,450
You mean, my trying to figure out
who murdered my wife? Can you imagine?

186
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,828
You do understand what will happen
when the townspeople learn

187
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,622
you're having them investigated?

188
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,416
They'll make noise.

189
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,084
-Great.
-No, not great.

190
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,379
I just spent six months trying to put
some light between this company

191
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,424
and words like marital affair, murder.

192
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,384
-Different lanes.
-I'm not disappearing your ass

193
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,888
back to Tokyo while I spend another six
putting out more fires you've lit.

194
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,598
Different fucking lanes!

195
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,184
This isn't about the company.

196
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh, because you and the company I protect
aren't at all the exact same thing?

197
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,364
Listen, I--

198
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,536
I understand that you're grieving.
That's reasonable.

199
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,037
Grieve.

200
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,705
But this?

201
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,919
This will cost not just you
but every person who works for you.

202
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,255
You'll destroy lives for nothing

203
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,758
because the worst offense
the townspeople are guilty of is

204
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,468
tacky athleisure.

205
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,805

270
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,580
It's just, there's no "you" here at all,

I'm not looking hard enough.

Hmm. "Recovery." This is a surprise.

00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,647
"Child endangerment"?

275
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,316
"Neglect."

276
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,400

00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,319

of every morning expressing gratitude.

00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,566

can get through this life without help.

If you're supposed to be giving us
the secret of joy,

308
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,824
what is it?

309
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,579
I don't hear you saying
what a 21st-century professional mother

310
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,789
is supposed to do to find happiness.

311
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,499
Simple.

312
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,543
If you focus on watering your own grass,

313
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,837
you never have to wonder
if it's greener anywhere else.

314
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,716
But what does that mean? I--
I water my own grass, and I don't--

315
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,636
-Okay, next.
-It's fine. You don't what?

316
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,014
You don't feel how incredibly green
your own grass is?

317
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,058
Is it possible
that you don't wanna succeed?

318
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:30,270
That you feel guilty for what you have
and you sabotage your happiness?

319
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,278
I would suggest a look inward
and read my book.

00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,448
To read more about your narcissistic climb
to success, when, poof,

321
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,450
you suddenly discovered
you were deserving?

322
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,786
Sounds like privileged bullshit to me.

323
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm not sorry.

I do want to succeed, obviously, right?

325

You are forgiven.

I'm sorry.

519
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,727
About earlier.
I know you were just trying to help.

520
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,397
I know it's no excuse,

521
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,151
but my ex-husband brings out my worst.

522
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,569
It's okay.

523
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,030
We're all works in progress.

524
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,868
"When you've been worked on for so long,
you never know you're done."

525
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,205
Jericho Brown.

526
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,083
You know his work?

527
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,544
[Joe] What am I doing, using my old games
on you? I'm not this guy anymore.

528
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:54,509
I read his work in The New Yorker,
and that line... stayed with me.

529
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,637
But I don't know
his writing much, actually.

530
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,110
The way you've handled
those books. The care.

531
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,237
Only a mother-- Oh, there. Yep.

532
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,404
Okay, stop.

533
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,324
But just to pass the time...

534
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,370
It's a personal question,
but we are technically off-hours.

535
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,287
Just ask it.

536
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,748
What's your daughter like?

537
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,170
Amazing.

538
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,298
Kind, funny,

539
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,219
likes to go out
and look for fairy rings at the park.

540
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,388
Excellent at finding them.

541
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,806
Loves to draw.

542
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,266
Like her mom.

543
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,394
Yeah, nothing in this world beats
the feeling of...

544
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,646
Of looking at your child

545
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,482
and knowing you're watching
someone grow up better than you.

546
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,485
[Joe] How could you do anything
to hurt your child?

547
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,778
All I see is love.

548
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,946
Your turn.

549
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,991
-What's Henry like?
-Oh, he's a terrorist.

550
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:05,580
No, he's-- He's adorable, he's sweet.
A big fan of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.

551
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,707
No surprise,
you've seen him with the bottle.

552
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,460
I really hope he's better than me.

553
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,213
Why do you look like that?

554
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,889
I had this idea...

555
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,142
of happily ever after.

556
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,020
Perfect family, picket fence.
Now I have that.

557
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,855
I want what's best for my son.

558
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,317
I'm just worried that this suburban,
cookie-cutter existence isn't...

559
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,820
Isn't it. I know it's nothing compared
to your situation.

560
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,114
-I shouldn't be complaining.
-No, I get it.

561
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,075
Raising kids is a whole different game
once you've gone through the system.

562
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,997
Soon as you told me
you didn't come from money,

563
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,124
all of a sudden
I could just see it on you.

564
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,547
Yeah, I had been in a dozen foster homes
before I hit 18,

565
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,468
and still, even though I knew
it made no sense, I...

566
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,097
I never stopped thinking
my mom would show up and save me.

567
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,559
She never did, of course,

568
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,812
but sure made me wanna be
a better mom though.

569
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,733
I held on to that same hope.

570
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,569
For years.

571
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,698
And got my ass kicked regularly for it.

572
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,117
I think it kept me going.

573
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,871
But she never came back either.

574
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,710
I never talk about this with anyone,
not even Love.

575
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,383
Despite her best intentions,
she could only understand to a point.

576
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,551
[Joe] But you understand completely.

577
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,473
Um...

578
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,934
We should get back to it.

579
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,561
What happened with Ryan?

580
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,314
I'm sorry.

581
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,984
I'm not okay with what I saw,

582
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,696
and I would like to know
how someone who treats you like that

583
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,739
could have custody of your child.

584
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,346
We were both addicts...

585
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,598
when Juliette was a baby.

586
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,727
One night, I...

587
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,563
I sailed through a red light.

588
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,025
And the other driver
was very seriously hurt,

589
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,862
and the way that we collided,
if Juliette had been on the other side...

590
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,613
[Joe] Reckless endangerment of a child.

591
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,616
That disaster, and the fact
that he got clean before I did,

592
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,702
is how Ryan got full custody.

593
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,124
The lies he's told ever since is
how he's kept it.

594
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,250
The lies?

595
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,544
Well, you know, he's got money.

596
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,547
Beloved local celeb, a white man.

597
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,217
And I think we can both agree,
white men get a million chances in life.

598
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:10,181
So when he accuses me of child neglect,
for not showing up for my visitation,

599
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,724
they believe him.

600
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,518
Even when I swear
he gave me the wrong address.

601
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,731
He can have me arrested
for destruction of property

602
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,902
for keying his car that I barely scratched
'cause I chickened out.

603
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,570
And my favorite,

604
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,491
verbal and emotional abuse
for calling him a dickhead.

605
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,246
Yeah, and he's had this case built
against me for years,

606
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,873
and everyone believes him,

607
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:40,920
everyone takes his word over mine
because... who am I?

608
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,047
I'm sorry.

609
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,551
I'm so sorry for what you've been through.

610
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,682
Nobody forced me
to get behind the wheel that night.

611
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,600
That's...

612
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,395
That's a choice I live with.

613
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,815
Yeah, but everything else,
Ryan manipulating the justice system,

614
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,066
somebody should stop him.

615
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,694
-I volunteer, happily.
-Well, I am working on it.

616
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,281
I just met a new lawyer
for dinner last night.

617
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,784
[Joe] Lawyer. You weren't on a date.

618
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,870
He thinks joint custody is doable

619
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,416
if I can just show
how I'm really doing now

620
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,834
and the judge sees it.

621
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:26,799
If I was sure Ryan could never find us,
I would grab Juliette and run to Paris.

622
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,137
And spend our days
drawing outside Sacré-Cœur.

623
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,057
That sounds magical.

624
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,350
For you.

625
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,103
Tragic for me to lose you.

626
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,274
I shouldn't have reduced you to my issues.
You're nothing like my mother.

627
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,276
You adore your child
and she should be with you.

628
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,736
You're just who you are.

629
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,866
You don't hide or embellish,
you own your mistakes

630
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,953
and stand up to the strikes
against you. You're so...

631
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,667
Oh! No! Please, no!

632
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,462
It's okay, look.

633
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,173
I think, it's-- It's just us.

634
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,892
[dramatic music playing]

635
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,431
Oh, shit.

636
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,350
Love is gonna kill you.

637
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,979
[pop music playing over speakers]

638
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,873
Haven't really been yourself this weekend.

639
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,752
-You really pregnant?
-This is a hangover.

640
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,588
I'm not pregnant.

641
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm sorry to hear that.

642
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,969
It's fine.

643
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,595
Then what's going on?

644
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,846
I don't know.

645
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,435
I'm just not happy.

646
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,189
And it's not Joe's fault.

647
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,776
He's just not my soul mate.

648
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,989
No one who tries to love you really
measures up when you're a twin.

649
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,534
Well, I know from my own twins,
you are absolutely right.

650
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,036
But the whole soul-mate thing,

651
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,871
it's mostly bullshit.

652
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,874
You choose your soul mate.

653
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,334
Cary and I,

654
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,004
we had some fundamental problems.

655
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,172
I didn't even like him for a while.

656
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,386
But I decided he was my person,

657
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,887
and I made it work.

658
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,182
Love, it's mostly chemicals.

659
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,144
Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin.

660
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,437
To activate all three,

661
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,356
exercise, eat some protein,
squeeze in eight hugs a day.

662
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,817
-Mm.
-When you're happy and healthy,

663
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,236
then you can make real choices.

664
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,823
And that includes choosing your life mate.

665
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,074
That easy, huh?

666
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,659
It is not easy.

667
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,496
But it is so worth it.

668
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,499
[Love] Dear Forty,

669
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,961
you've been my best friend
since before we were born.

670
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,963
My other half.

671
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,675
But I can't keep holding back
because I miss you.

672
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,761
I can't raise a family
with a broken heart.

673
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,347
I have to choose Joe now.

674
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,562
I'll always love you.

675
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,607
But I have to say goodbye.

676
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,776
For real this time.

677
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,029
As much as it hurts.

678
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,158
Goodbye, you.

679
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,626
[knocking on door]

680
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,590
The fuck? What are you doing here?

681
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,094
You called me.

682
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,721
You drunk-dialed me at 4 a.m.

683
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,974
I was worried, so I... So I Ubered.

684
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,602
I'm sorry.
I don't remember that happening.

685
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,020
Oh, wow.

686
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,773
It's proof
that I'm in your subconscious though.

687
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,774
Okay.

688
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,528
I can drive you home,
but I need you to listen.

689
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,196
I care about you a lot.

690
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:03,575
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Can I just say something really quickly?

691
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,077
Sure.

692
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,912
My dad is a lot worse than I thought.

693
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:11,708
I went into his office,
and he hired a PI to stalk people.

694
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:16,755
And he has all this insane conspiracy shit

695
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,091
about Natalie's murder

696
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,928
with these names of people in Madre Linda,

697
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,013
including you and Joe.

698
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,265
[ominous music playing]

699
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,766
What?

700
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,408
Nurse Fiona,
I think you'll like this. It's--

701
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,833
Wait for you outside, beautiful.

702
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,342
Hey, kid.

703
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,678
Love that book.

704
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,315
Sorry, today is not a good day.
I have to--

705
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,484
He gets mad at you and he hurts you.

706
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,029
He says he's sorry,
it'll never happen again,

707
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,490
and he gives you flowers, right?

708
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,661
There are a lot of bad men out there,

709
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,248
and sometimes you can't tell
until it's too late.

710
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,292
Go outside and eat with the other boys.

711
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:56,396
[Joe] I know now, Marienne.
I know why "you," and it's no pattern.

712
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,650
But today starts the next phase

713
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,862
of my growth to know you exist,
to see you, to love you even,

714
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,864
and to never have you.

715
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,701
Because as long as I love you,
you'll be in danger.

716
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,330
Hi. Hi, can we talk?

717
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,375
-We have a lot to do today.
-[Joe] You wanna forget what happened.

718
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,585
Go back to business as usual.
I can't go back.

719
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,297
It's only a matter of time before I'm
making treasure boxes for Love to find.

720
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,758
-Marienne...
-I have feelings for you.

721
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,969
I know nothing can happen.

722
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,889
You're married,
with the cutest baby on the planet,

723
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,933
and I'd never do anything
to split up a family,

724
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,434
and I need you to know that.

725
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,604
Not that you'd ever,

726
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,773
obviously, because...

727
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,526
you love your wife,

728
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,322
and we were just exhausted
and caught up in the moment.

729
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,576
So don't worry, I don't--
I don't want anything.

730
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,535
I just...

731
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:56,206
It can go away.
It can dissolve into nothing. Okay?

732
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,666
Cool?

733
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,459
Wait.

734
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,338
It's-- It's not nothing.

735
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,882
I'd never break up your family.

736
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,095
-I'd never do anything to hurt Henry.
-I know.

737
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,641
I'd never get in the way
of you getting your family back.

738
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,729
-I would never hurt Juliette.
-I know.

739
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:28,989
[Joe] Oh, no.

740
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:31,950
We can't do this.

741
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,368
I know.

742
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,703
Shit.

743
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,335
No, you...

744
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,962
-You have to go before this...
-I know. We can't.

745
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,881
I came here to quit.

746
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,342
I thought this would make it easier.

747
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,511
You don't have to do that.

748
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:56,808
But we should talk
when we're a bit more clear-headed.

749
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,025
[Joe] I have never felt more clear-headed.

750
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,611
But I do need time to figure out
what I'm gonna do about Love.

751
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,701
I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I'll never let anyone hurt you.

752
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,496
I will stay ahead of her this time.

753
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,498
-You're home early.
-Hey.

754
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,958
There you are. Did you not get my texts?

755
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,919
We need to talk.

756
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,004
[Joe] She knows.
How the hell could she already know?

757
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,589
-Is everything okay?
-No.

758
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,550
Theo told me that Matthew hired a PI
to look into people.

759
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,761
He doesn't think Natalie's case is closed.

760
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,554
Okay. So, what does he have?

761
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
I don't know,
but I may be able to find out.

762
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,059
-How?
-We know Theo has a crush on me...

763
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,480
-And you wanna use that?
-Sort of.

764
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,650
Like, okay, I'm just gonna say it.
You can shoot it down.

765
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:51,905
But I could... pretend
like he had a chance.

766
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:55,117
Like, 19-year-olds will do anything
if they think sex is on the table.

767
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,035
[Joe] Well, this took a turn,

768
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,206
but if Love's focused on this,
she'll be too distracted to notice us.

769
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:05,127
I know, I was-- It's crazy,
and I'm asking you for a lot of trust,

770
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,753
-but I really--
-It's a great idea.

771
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,966
I trust you.

772
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,759
We are a team.

773
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,511
The best team.

774
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,477
[Joe] We are the best team.

775
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:26,565
Even if we're not soul mates,
it's a kind of love.

776
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:32,028
And it keeps her eyes somewhere else,
so the rest I can give to you.

777
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,031
This is great for everyone.

778
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,913
