We bury her in the woods.

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,443
Love, this is my son, Theo.

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,779
-I didn't know you had a son.
-Stepson from my first marriage.

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,865
I got the twins wearing those Vital Rings.

7
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,409
-Does this have GPS?
-[Cary] We all wear them.

8
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,244
[Joe] If Matthew has access
to Natalie's ring,

9
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,872
he'll be able to see exactly where she is.

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,542
I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,629
So... they know.

12

And who am I to argue with Harper Lee?

18
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,750
Then again, Scout didn't help

19
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,087
to cover up the murder
of the next-door neighbor's wife.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,968
Here, in Madre Linda,
safest neighborhood in the Golden State,

21
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,138
every passing morning brings
more attention.

22
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,475
A woman has disappeared.

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:45,396
It's domestic noir come to life,
and people are here for it.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,731
Keep it going.

25
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,191
Hold, hold, hold.

by the disappearance of Natalie Engler.

31
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,040
The 32-year-old realtor was last seen
leaving her home for work.

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,086
Her vehicle was found outside
a cabin near Redwoods State Park.

33
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,255
-Ready, sweetie?
-Yeah.

in cutting-edge surveillance,

37
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,891
has not made a public statement.

38
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,018
God, I hope she just ran off somewhere.

39
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,980
For now, friends are hopeful

40
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,942
that the police will find her
with the help of this community.

Ryan Goodwin, Channel 3 News.

We got it.

Every day it's the same fucking story.

44
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,328
We need him to give a statement.

-There's more vans than yesterday.

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,643
I wish they'd move on already.

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,228
[Joe] You are worried.

50
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,897
I'm sure they will. Soon.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,483
Your previous mistakes were cleaned up
by the family fixer.

52
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,029
No media or police to deal with
when they've been paid off.

53
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,865
When do you think
everything will die down?

54
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,201
A week, maybe two.

55
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,411
How can you be so calm?

56
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,749
[Joe] Experience. Try killing
a celebrity comedian without a fixer.

57
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,666
Joe.

58
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,503
I'm scared.

59
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,465
Dr. Chandra said
that we should give words to our emotions.

60
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,507
Well, I'm...

61
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,718
scared.

62
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,474
I'm not gonna let anything bad happen.

63
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,434
We have done everything right.

64
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,271
But the ring?
That was a close call, but we fixed it.

65
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,856
We talked to the cops.

66
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,234
They didn't raise an eyebrow.

67
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,693
This won't take long.

68
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,988
Is there anything
you can tell us about Natalie Engler

69
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,491
or her relationship with her husband?

70
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,535
We just moved here
a few months ago with a newborn,

71
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,830
so we haven't had much time
for socializing.

72
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,752
Yeah. She did help me lease my bakery,
but other than that,

73
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,420
I don't really know them.

74
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,507
-I wish we could tell you more.
-Can I refill your coffee?

75
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,469
Of course they're not gonna act
like they're suspicious.

76
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,348
True. But we haven't given them
a reason to be suspicious. What?

[reporters clamoring]

78

A few questions, sir.

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,729
Matthew, Channel 6.
A quick statement, please.

80

Hey, hey.

[Goodwin] Have the police said anything?

83
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,696
Get off my property
or I'll have you removed.

84

-[Goodwin] Matthew, statement.
-[man] Can you say something?

85

He's innocent, but he's acting guilty.
That's strange but... good.

86

Good for us.
If he goes down for this, we're free.

You feel trapped
and it's clouding your judgment.

90
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,633
It's probably best
if no one goes down for this, right?

91
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,972
Like, if nobody finds the body,
people will eventually assume she ran off.

92
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,849
Yeah. You're right.

93
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,769
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

94
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,108
This.

95
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:22,155

We keep watching the news, just in case.

for any questions. He knows all.

175
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,769
All-knowing Dante's listening
to the news. It's about Natalie Engler.

176
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,770
[Joe] Oh, no.

177
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,981
Madre Linda has
her own Missing White Woman.

178
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:11,360
Missing White Woman Syndrome is
America's favorite pastime next to porn.

179
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,989
-Missing White Woman...?
-Syndrome.

180
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,075
When upper-class,
attractive white ladies go missing,

181
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,077
they get tons of media coverage.

182
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,913
-Doesn't happen for other victims.
-Yeah.

183
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,168
Well, the media has a thirst
for anything salacious, right?

184
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,380
Why do I feel like I'm failing a test?

185
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,299
We're speaking of a specific phenomenon.

186
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,761
When white women receive
disproportionately high attention,

187
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,638
a clear message is being sent.

188
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,225
White ladies deserve to be rescued.
The rest of us can fend for ourselves.

189
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,519
Agreed. Obviously.

190
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,521
I'm not sure why you're saying "obviously"

191
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,982
when you didn't even know
about the phenomenon.

192
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,777
Mm. She got you there, beanpole.

193
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,696
-[Joe] How does he know I--?
-[Marienne] Tender is the Night.

194
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,114
You knew her.

195
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,949
-We're neighbors.
-Shush.

196
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,369
They're about to interview her friend.

197
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,080
-Mind if I have a bathroom break?
-Bathroom's that way.

198
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,414
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

199
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,797
-Dante, kill me now.
-Is he cute?

200
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,216
[Joe] Are you kidding me?

201
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,051
[Sherry on video] We set up a tip line,

202
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,428
and you can follow us
on Facebook, Twitter,

203
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,931
Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, and Tumblr.

204
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,600
For those of you
that are still using that.

205
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,687
Finding Natalie seems
incredibly important to you.

206
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, my God, it's my number one priority.
Natalie was my dearest and closest friend.

207
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,444
[Joe] She hated her.

208
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,196
[Sherry] We all loved her.

209
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,117
I'm not really sure why
her husband hasn't told you this,

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,578
but I think the public would like
to hear from him.

211
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,165
[Joe] And she just slipped in
a Matthew dig on live television.

212
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,084
Bitchy, but not the worst thing for us.

213
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,211
[Goodwin]
Why do you think Natalie's disappearance

214
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,630
has struck such a chord in this community?

215
00:11:54,714 --> 00:12:00,136
Natalie is a woman who cares deeply
for this town and everyone in it.

216
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,722
In fact, one of the last things she did

217
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,183
was lease a space for a bakery
for her next-door neighbor.

218
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,893
She lives right over there.

219
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,521
[Joe] Did Sherry Conrad just tell
the entire world

220
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,817
that one of the last people who saw
the Missing White Woman was my wife?

221
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,112
I have to reassure you.
Everything is fine. Still fine.

222
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,947
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Who the hell is this?

223
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,366
Hello?

224
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,247
Hi. Yeah, absolutely.
What can I do for you, detective?

225
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,623
Fuck me.

226
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,629
[Falco] When we spoke
to you and your wife,

227
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,131
you said you barely knew Natalie.

228
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,716
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

229
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,469
Then why is there security footage

230
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,472
of you two chatting
in a grocery store parking lot

231
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,182
two days before she vanished?

232
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,769
[Joe] Sweating? I need to get it together.

233
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,232
Coincidence. I like to say hi
when I run into a neighbor.

234
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,234
How do you explain...

235
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
this exchange?

236
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,157
[Joe] Does every inch of Madre Linda
have a camera?

237
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,786
Do you typically receive prophylactics
from your neighbors

238
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,913
when you just stop to say hi?

239
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,458
[Joe] They don't suspect me.
They are just doing their job.

240
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,168
I need to stop sweating.

241
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,753
[cell phone buzzing]

242
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,091
-You can deal with that if you need to.
-[Joe] So they can observe my behavior.

243
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,760
No, it's fine. It's okay.

244
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,845
Condoms...

245
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,307
The thing is,
Natalie has a weird sense of humor,

246
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,017
and she gave these to me as a joke.

247
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,852
I still don't know what she meant.

248
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,522
What do they want? A confession?

249
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,859
Wait. That's not a terrible idea.

250
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:45,950
I wasn't going to say this.
But I think I need to come clean.

251
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,410
I live with a newborn...

252
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,040
and a very stressed wife.

253
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
There's nowhere...

254
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,174
for a man to enjoy himself,
if you understand what I'm saying.

255
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,137
Add in a mother-in-law who stops
by unannounced frequently--

256
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,932
We strongly advise you

257
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,185
to not do that anymore.

258
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,522
I will try to contain myself.

259
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,861
Masturbation saves the day for now.

260
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,536
-We're at A Fresh Tart and look at this.
-[bells chiming]

261
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,999
We got Madre Linda's
newest baking queen, Love Quinn.

262
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,626
-Are you--?
-I'm making an ironic TikTok.

263
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,711
Delete it!

264
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,546
Okay.

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,340
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

266
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,052
-Yep. It's deleted.
-I'm just having a bad hair day.

267
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,554
Looks pretty good to me.

268
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,348
Stop that.

269
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,600
Stop what?

270
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,767
Flirting.

271
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,687
Yeah, okay. Yes. Yes.

272
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,607
-Yes, you are right. You are married.
-Thank you.

273
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,527
Now, what can I get you?

274
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,073
Okay, so my house
is swarming with reporters.

275
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,702
So I had to jump my fence
just to go get some lunch,

276
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,956
which is also the story
of why I forgot my wallet.

277
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,874
Ah.

278
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,503
And now I am gonna die
starving and destitute.

279
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,631
Unless...

280
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,300
you were to...

281
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,888
My issue is that you're still flirting
and I asked you not to.

282
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:35,309
I'm not flirting with you.
I'm begging you for food.

283
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,189
Okay. Jesus fucking Christ.

284
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,900
Thank you, my lady and savior.

285
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,401
Okay.

286
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,905
-Carrot or chai walnut?
-Carrot, please.

287
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,959
Fuck, did I just fail
a secret personality test or something?

288
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,670
Oh, no, I, um...

289
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,923
That was my first recipe.

290
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,885
And I used to make it all the time
for my brother when he would...

291
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,430
When he came around.

292
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,267
Well, let's see.

293
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,652
Are you fucking kidding me?

294
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,737
What the fuck?

295
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,078
Must be hard with Natalie missing.

296
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,123
You know, I love a media zoo.

297
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,626
How are you holding up?
Do you have people you can talk to?

298
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,717
-[cell phone ringing]
-I wasn't trying to pry. I'm, um--

299
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,012
Mom? I'm sorry. I can't--

300
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,056
Wait, slow down.

301
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,268
Oh, my God. Um...

302
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,022
Okay. Yes. I'm on my way. Mm-hm.

303
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,859
-Is everything okay? What's going on?
-My baby is sick.

304
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,527
-Oh.
-I need to go.

305
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,906
I need to close the bakery
and turn off the ovens.

306
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,827
No, I know. You know what?
I got it. I got it. I can do it.

307
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,789
I know how ovens work. It'll be fine.
Go be with your baby. Go.

308
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,750
-Be with your baby.
-Yeah.

309
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,836
-There's a spare key in the drawer.
-Okay, in the drawer.

310
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,754
Yeah.

311
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,672
[bells chiming]

312
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,053
[Joe] What if the detectives
weren't just fishing?

313
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,221
What if they know more
than they were saying?

314
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,725
But no one knew about Natalie and me
except Love, at least, I think.

315
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,642
Unless--

316
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,605
There.

317
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,401
[Joe]
Matthew. What if there were more cameras?

318
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,487
What if she lied to me,
her boring neighbor?

319
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,198
What if Matthew's building a case
against me?

320
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,324
-Shit.
-[cell phone buzzing]

321
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,159
I never called you back. I must be calm.

322
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,745
You're a steady, stalwart Atticus Finch.

323
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,248
-I'm sorry, they had more questions.
-[Love] I'm at the hospital.

324
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,292
Henry has the measles.

325
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,926
[Joe] I've been kidnapped,
held at knifepoint, held at gunpoint,

326
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,470
lost a finger, been locked in a cage,

327
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,639
but in my history of scared,

328
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,140
this...

329
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,435
is the most scared I've ever been.

330
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
That nurse has been gone
an awfully long time.

331
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,940
It's a quick test. He'll be right back.

332
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,527
I looked at his blood work
and he was infected about a week ago.

333
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,279
How? I thought
the measles were eradicated.

334
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,280
Even with COVID,

335
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,908
there are parents
who don't have their kids vaccinated.

336
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,495
You need to contact anyone
who's been near Henry right away.

337
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,997
You've all had your immunizations?

338
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,040
-Yes.
-Yeah.

339
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm sure I did.

340
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,002
[Joe] Oh, really, Ms. Peace,
Love and Yoni Eggs?

341
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,841
-Are you sure you had Love vaccinated?
-What does--? Yes, don't be ridiculous.

342
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,092
What are the symptoms?

343
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:59,096
-Fever?
-Cough, runny nose, general discomfort.

344
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,977
Now, in severe cases,
hearing loss, possible seizures.

345
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,397
[Joe] Correction.
This is the most scared I've ever been.

346
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,943
Is there medicine?

347
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,280
For the fever.
Otherwise, it has to run its course.

348
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,824
We'll keep him a few more hours
for observation.

349
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,741
Okay.

350
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,368
Thank you.

351
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,332
Hi, Margaret, it's Love.

352
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,919
Sorry to be delivering this news,
but Henry has the measles.

353
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,671
I'm calling from the hospital.

354
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,214
Thought I should let you know

355
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,758
since we were all
at Hudson's birthday party last week.

356
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,303
-Oh, my God.
-I'm so sorry.

357
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,512
Oh, my God.

358
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,140
-[cell phone beeping]
-Um--

359
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,476
-I'm getting a call. Do you mind?
-I have to go.

360
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,192
-Hi, Sherry. I was about to call.
-[Sherry] I just heard.

361
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,651
Poor little guy!

362
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,154
But you do not need to feel embarrassed.

363
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,322
Embarrassed?

364
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,658
Why don't I handle the calls
so you can focus on Henry?

365
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,246
Um, that's very kind,
but it's important that I do it myself.

366
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,498
Love? Love?

367
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,127
Ooh.

368
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,338
Did you hear about Love's baby?

369
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,215
-What happened?
-What happened?

370
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
My heart is breaking for them.

371
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,516
Yes, I have to run, Mustafa.
Can we finish this afternoon?

372
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,518
Good. Ciao.

373
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,190
How were those calls?
I hope your friends weren't too upset.

374
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,025
Why were you on the phone?

375
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,570
If something's wrong, you need to tell me.

376
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,530
I'm buying a vineyard.

377
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,076
-You're doing what?
-Buying a vineyard, Love.

378
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,996
So the money that was in flux
is no longer there.

379
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,832
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

380
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,876
Your bakery will be fine.

381
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,211
You'll figure it out.

382
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,296
You're amazing.

383
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,925
-Now don't get upset.
-I'm not upset. This is enlightening.

384
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,927
I keep asking myself, wondering:

385
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,137
"Why do I keep trying
to win Sherry's approval

386
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,725
when she keeps stabbing me in the back
like a fucking stealth cunt?"

387
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,937
It's obvious.
I'm recreating my relationship with you.

388
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,564
You're under a lot of stress.
I know you don't mean--

389
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,191
God. I want you to leave.

390
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,819
I came here for a fresh start,
and you followed me here

391
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,862
and brought
all your toxic garbage with you.

392
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,447
You have so much anger.

393
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,700
It's not healthy.

394
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,962
[Joe] Is this retribution for my sins?

395
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,840
[whispering] You have to get better.

396
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,175
[monitor beeping]

397
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,304
I haven't always been the best person.

398
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,140
But being your dad...

399
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,644
is changing me.

400
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,148
You get better.

401
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,777
Just get better. I promise
to be a man worthy of raising you.

402
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,076
[reporter] Ryan Goodwin with the latest
in the Natalie Engler investigation.

403
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,620
Friends close to Natalie Engler say
she went missing

404
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,665
shortly after submitting
the lease for this bakery,

405
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,793
owned by local resident
Love Quinn-Goldberg.

406
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,546
Could this be the last place
Natalie was seen?

407
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,968
Joe?

408
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,805
[Joe] As if things weren't fucked enough.

409
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,853
So cops are asking you questions,
and my name and business are on the news.

410
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,356
Acting normal isn't working.
We need to do something.

411
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,650
You're right.
You're right. Matthew's a threat.

412
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,197
But everybody already thinks
that he did something to her.

413
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,281
You're saying--?

414
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,950
Frame him. Trying to think
of a word not from a movie.

415
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,285
It's fine. I'm in.

416
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,288
How?

417
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,961
I do still have one thing from the box.

418
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,884
Natalie's scarf with her blood on it.
I only kept it for insurance.

419
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,220
Take care of it.

420
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,941
[Joe] Whoa. Oof.

421
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,858
Okay.

422
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:31,201
What? How? No. But it can't be.

423
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,286
I thought I was sweating
because I'm guilty.

424
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,707
The measles, for fuck's sake!
What else can go wrong?

425
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,628
That-- That came on fast.

426
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,798
I've gotta get to Matthew's house
to plant the scarf.

427
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,802
Uh. I'm burning up.
Room is spinning. Everything--

428
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,054
I've got to do this. All over a scarf.

429
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,848
Focus, focus.

430
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,016
I should lie down.

431
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,726
You sure about that?

432
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,731
[Joe] This can't be good.

433
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,900
Weren't you in the middle of something?

434
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,156
Like saving your family?

435
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,073
Yes.

436
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,743
Yes, my family.

437
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,374
I have to plant
Natalie's scarf at Matthew's.

438
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,835
You could hop the fence in the backyard.

439
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,753
No. No, he has cameras.

440
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,591
The one outside is broken.
If you're worried, pop a hoodie on.

441
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,926
You'll look just like
Matthew's douchebag kid.

442
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,727
Sealed and everything.

443
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,229
It's almost like you anticipated
needing it all along.

444
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,440
-Shut up.
-You shut up.

445
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,359
Where are you going?

446
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,322
Where you should be going.
Boo Radley's house.

447
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,823
[dramatic music playing]

448
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,345
[indistinct chatter]

449
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,855
Okay.

450
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,149
One foot in front of the other.

451
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,322
[Henry crying]

452
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,116
[Love crying]

453
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,955
Where is he?

454
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,250
Where's Henry?

455
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,710
Did you get vaccinated, Joe?

456
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,795
[EKG flatlining]

457
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,468
He's not moving! Somebody get a doctor!
Somebody help me!

458
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,805
[Fiona] Joe?

459
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,642
Are you not feeling well?

460
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,815
I'm Nurse Fiona.
I'm going to check you out.

461
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,901
Come in. Sit down.

462
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,750
Open up.

463
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
So you think you have a fever, huh?

464
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,759
-If the boys are being mean to you--
-I can take care of myself.

465
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,677
I know.

466
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,139
You can stay here as long as you like.

467
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,809
[gasps]

468
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,147
You're gonna be fine.

469
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:58,575
You know, I noticed that we don't have
any record of your vaccinations.

470
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,579
-Did your mom ever take you to get a shot?
-Yeah, of course.

471
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:07,000
I think maybe in the move,
we lost a record or something, but...

472
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,503
she did it.

473
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,421
She was good.

474
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,924
[other Joe]
No. No, you shouldn't have said that.

475
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,095
If you hadn't lied, you wouldn't be sick.

476
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,307
Tell the nurse. She was a terrible mother.

477
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,809
-Stop it.
-She was selfish and crazy.

478
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,311
-Stop.
-Didn't take care of you.

479
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,812
Go away. Go away!

480
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,273
-Where are you going?
-It's too late now!

481
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,069
[dramatic music playing]

482
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,078
Hey! Look at me! Hey!
Look at me! Look at me!

483
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,829
Calm down.

484
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,373
Calm down.

485
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,045
[Joe] I think this is real.

486
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,798
What were you doing in my backyard?

487
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,633
[Joe] Fuck.

488
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,718
Fuck. Fuck!

489
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:06,935
[Theo] Love.

490
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,062
-Hey.
-Hi.

491
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,400
Um, here.
I thought I would bring you dinner.

492
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,734
It's tacos.

493
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,112
Very thoughtful of you.

494
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,782
So how is your son doing?

495
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,743
-He's okay.
-Yeah? That's good.

496
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,412
He's, uh...

497
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,792
He's not okay.

498
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,712
Some fucking brain-dead anti-vaxxer
got him sick,

499
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,506
and it's probably getting
other people infected

500
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,885
with some horrible life-threatening virus
that shouldn't even be a thing anymore.

501
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,303
Hey, hey, hey.

502
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
It's okay.

503
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,728
-I'm sorry.
-Hey. Mm-mm.

504
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,980
You don't have to apologize.

505
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,607
Oh. I locked up the store.

506
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,777
It was a really nice distraction
from being at home.

507
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,321
Until the news crew arrived.

508
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,406
Mm.

509
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,784
Uh, when are you going back to school?

510
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,370
Uh, I don't know. I feel like...

511
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,790
we should probably wait
until we know about Natalie.

512
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:16,463
So if you need some cheap-to-free labor
at the bakery,

513
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,423
I'm your guy.

514
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,425
Yeah, come in whenever you want.

515
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,011
I could use the help.

516
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,346
Okay.

517
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,099
That would be great. Yeah.

518
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,852
Especially if it gets me away
from my dad. Even better.

519
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,147
He's really that hard to live with?

520
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:35,982
Yeah.

521
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,443
He's just never really been
a communicator,

522
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,779
but, you know, his wife's missing.

523
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,280
So if there was a time

524
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,742
to start expressing
some form of emotion, it's now.

525
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:49,370
But he's not.
He's, like, totally closed off.

526
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,748
I don't know.
I just feel like it's gonna make him,

527
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,125
like, even that more unreachable.

528
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,839
You okay?

529
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,217
-[Katzir] Ms. Quinn-Goldberg?
-Yes.

530
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,719
-A moment?
-Yes. Thank you.

531
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,930
-Thank you.
-[stammers] Yeah, of course.

532
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,732
[Joe] How did I end up here?

533
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,278
Oh, I was coming here to hide the scarf.
Did he catch me trying to hide it?

534
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,363
I'm sick.

535
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,324
I was having a fever dream.

536
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,453
I must have hopped your fence.

537
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,747
[coughing]

538
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,376
I've got the measles.

539
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,753
-So you really--
-I've been immunized.

540
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
Surprised you weren't.

541
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,299
[Joe] It's like he's waiting for me
to give myself away.

542
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,177
What would
a normal neighbor say right now?

543
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,179
Yeah, me too. I should've known.

544
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,475
I have a few gaps in my childhood.

545
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
I'm sorry about your wife.

546
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:03,528
I considered coming over,
but I didn't wanna bother you.

547
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,574
There's that look again.

548
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,450
Does he know I kissed Natalie?

549
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,828
Is he the reason the police are up my ass?

550
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,498
-Natalie said you were becoming friends.
-[Joe] Shit.

551
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,625
-You had a glass of wine.
-[Joe] Game over.

552
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,296
Did she say anything to you
about going to visit her sister?

553
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,590
[Joe] Or he doesn't know anything.

554
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,259
He's just hoping
I can help him find his missing wife.

555
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,510
I'm sorry.

556
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,054
She didn't mention it.

557
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,474
-[coughing]
-You should rest.

558
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,311
I gave you some Tylenol
to help bring down the fever.

559
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,355
[Joe] Is it possible Matthew's a nice guy?

560
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,273
Thank you.

561
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,611
Sure.

562
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,121
-There's no updates on my son.
-What's wrong with your son?

563
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,248
He's sick too.

564
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,958
He's in the hospital.

565
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,754
What if he doesn't get better?

566
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,759
What if they get punished for our sins?

567
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,014
I think...

568
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,225
it's not punishment, it's...

569
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,563
They reflect our sins back at us
so clearly, it's blinding.

570
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,734
I never saw myself becoming a father.

571
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,696
Then I met Theo's mom.
People become dads all kinds of ways.

572
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,574
I was even kind of excited about it,
and Theo was a great kid.

573
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,828
But I was young and extremely ambitious.

574
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,333
I was a shitty stepdad
and he hated me for it.

575
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,006
But now his mom's remarried, new family,
and Theo hates her even more.

576
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,050
He's come back here almost by default.

577
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,136
Most of the time,
I still have no idea what I'm doing.

578
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,931
All I know is that he needs me.

579
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,936
He needs me on some primal level,
just like your son needs you.

580
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,071
Are you sure Natalie didn't say anything
to you about taking a trip?

581
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,823
I'm sure she's fine.

582
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,326
She's done this for attention,
and she's too embarrassed to come home.

583
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,080
You don't think
anything's happened to her, do you?

584
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,791
[Joe] What have we done, Love?

585
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,794
I wanna help, but safest thing

586
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:29,048
is to let him stay silent and hang himself
in the court of public opinion.

587
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,800
[cell phone buzzing]

588
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,514
He's okay.

589
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,727
-He's gonna be okay.
-That's good.

590
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,270
[Joe] Henry's okay.

591
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,940
And I promised him
I'd be a good man, worthy.

592
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,027
I cannot frame an innocent man.
I can't do it.

593
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,280
I'd be killing a mockingbird.

594
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,452
I know that you love Natalie,
but you're not talking to the press.

595
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,246
-I don't care about the press.
-You should.

596
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,166
If you don't tell your story,
they will tell it for you.

597
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,085
You can't be there for Theo
if you're behind bars.

598
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,844
[door closes]

599
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,724
Hey.

600
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,059
Oh, hey.

601
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:26,064
Oh, no, no.
I didn't realize you were sick too.

602
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,609
-You poor thing.
-It's okay. It's okay. I'm recovering.

603
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,987
-How is he?
-He misses his daddy.

604
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,577
Don't ever scare us like that again,
Mr. Dramatic.

605
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,789
I love you too much.

606
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,460
Did you do it?

607
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,547
[Joe] What you're really asking is
what kind of father I am.

608
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,716
Wish you could go through the front.

609
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,802
-Reporters, I get it.
-Yeah.

610
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,971
-You sure I can't help you home?
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

611
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,099
My wife and kid are coming back.

612
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,644
-You've done more than enough.
-Okay. Get home safe.

613
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,730
Don't wanna find you passed out
by the trash again.

614
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,609
Mm.

616
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,294
I did it.

617
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,797
But then...

618
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,801
I took it back.

619
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,178
Matthew's a decent man.

620
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,682
He already lost his wife.
If we send him to prison--

621
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,517
What kind of people would we be?

622
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,685
[Joe] Wow.

623
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,562
You get it.

624
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,939
We're better than that.

626
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,568
We are.

627
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,285
What does it mean to be a good father?

628
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,494
To protect, yes.

629
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,830
But can you be a good father

630
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,582
if you're a bad man?

631
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,544
It's not the kind of father I wanna be
and the kind of mother you wanna be.

00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,461
Thank God.

Is this some kind of strategy?

[Joe] Sherry and Kiki
held out the longest,

649
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,273
but that's so they could grab
the best flowers for a photo shoot.

Let's go. Come on.

653
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,573
[Joe] I don't think Matthew wanted
to look even guiltier,

654
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,243

[ominous music playing]

659
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,304
It would mean a lot to Natalie to see
how many people came out here.

660
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,890
How many people care.

661
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,479
[Joe] It wasn't a strategy.

662
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:58,192
He waited so long
because he almost couldn't do it.

663
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,278
It's that hard for him to talk about her.

664
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,738
Because he cares.

Natalie, if you're watching this,

666

please come home.

Or let me know you're okay.

to go down for this.

00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,157
[Joe] It's been said,
"Nothing ever happens in the suburbs."

690
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,077
[doorbell rings]

691
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,122
-Hey.
-Hey.

692
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,878
It's an inadequate gesture
for making sure I didn't die last week.

693
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,048
Unnecessary. Thank you.
I'm glad you're better.

694
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,802
If you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a call.

695
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,142
[Joe] Maybe it's more like,
"Nothing ever really changes."

696
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,687
[pop music playing over speakers]

697
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,153
[bells chiming]

698
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,573
-Hey.
-You're not closed yet, are you?

699
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,369
No, Gil, hey. You're just in time.
What can I get you?

700
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,832
-How about half a dozen blueberry?
-Coming right up.

701
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,585
Hey, I haven't seen Margaret.

702
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,090
-Wanna tell her I said hi?
-Yeah, yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

703
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,175
Margaret would have come too,

704
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,887
but she took the girls to her mom's
while they're recovering.

705
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,973
Oh. Were they sick?

706
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,141
Not anymore.

707
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,143
But they both had it.

708
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,813
Can't tell you how sorry we are
for exposing Henry.

709
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,984
Both your daughters had measles?

710
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,028
Margaret really regrets not saying
anything when you called.

711
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,323
She was just stunned to hear
that Henry had to be hospitalized.

712
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,742
Our girls were pretty minor.

713
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,204
We hope you won't hold it against us.

714
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,542
You see, we just don't believe
in subjecting kids

715
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,711
to toxic injections they don't need

716
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,380
to fight things
their bodies were created to fight.

717
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,842
We don't judge people who do, of course.

718
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,263
Anyway, I-- Jeez.
I didn't come here to get on a soapbox.

719
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,057
Again, we apologize.

720
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,020
The most important thing is
that everyone is better now, right?

721
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:27,985
Thanks.

722
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,075
-Hey, Gil?
-Yep?

723
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,754
