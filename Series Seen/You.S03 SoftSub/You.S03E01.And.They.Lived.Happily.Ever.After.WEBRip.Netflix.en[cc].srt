-Our neighbor, Natalie.

175
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,846
She didn't give us a housewarming gift,
nothing when Forty was born.

176
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,973
Henry. Henry.

177
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,018
Yeah, I think you're right.
She seems a little off.

178
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,358
What, did I kiss you wrong? Or...

179
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,861
No, no, I'm just tired.

180
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,531
And this place is a mess.
And Sherry just said to my face...

181
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,244
-basically, that I'm a mess.
-She's an idiot. Just lie down.

182
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,830
I'll take care of this, take care of him.

183
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,791
-[Henry crying]
-Shh.

184
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,128
[Joe] And there he goes.
Every time I touch him.

185
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,922
Just fucking let me do it, Joe. Joe. Joe.

186
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,007
It's fine.

187
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,594
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

188
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,889
-[Henry stops crying]
-Hey, hey, hey.

189
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,016
[Joe] Why does my own child not like me?

190
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,436
You know, babies can tell
when your heart's not in it.

191
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,731
-I-- What--?
-No. I'm sorry. It's all in my head.

192
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,028
[pensive music playing]

193
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,283
Go fuck yourself.

194
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,502
[Joe] Love's right.
My heart's not really in it.

195
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,964
How could it be when you stole it?

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,758
Love?

197
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,928
Hey, uh...

198
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,683
we're running low on diapers,
so I'll be right back.

199
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,820
Honestly, you're what's gotten me
through this imprisonment.

200
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,492
The green light at the end of my dock.

201
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,497
Knowing you feel the same as I do.

202
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,875
Hello, neighbor.

203
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,428
[Joe] I don't want it
to happen here like this.

204
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,264
I want you some place luxurious.
You deserve that.

205
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,392
The car is fine. Shut up and kiss me.

206
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,018
Did you just read my mind?

207
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,687
[dramatic music playing]

208
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,484
[knocking on glass]

209
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,617
-Hey, neighbor.
-Hi, Natalie.

210
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,455
You must be so under-slept.
I hear your baby crying all the time.

211
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,332
-Oh.
-No, no. Babies cry. Just...

212
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,086
I get why you might be sleeping
in a grocery store parking lot.

213
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,964
Here. I thought I'd save you a trip.

214
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,883
[Joe] You've been watching me too.

215
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,218
-Thank you.
-One more thing.

216
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,847
Don't believe the bullshit
about breastfeeding preventing pregnancy.

217
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,141
My sister got knocked up so fast.

218
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,393
Friends tell friends. So...

219
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,273
[Joe] Are you flirting with me?

220
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,533
[Joe] Sure, the condom thing may be
a little joke from a neighbor

221
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,952
with a mild taste for stirring the pot.

222
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,414
Just friendly. Very friendly though.

223
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,584
Exciting as that is, I have to be careful.

224
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:18,339
I can't just walk out of this web.
The spider has my child.

225
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,217
Also, truth? I've made...

226
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,887
mistakes in the past.

227
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,894
Would you be a mistake?

228
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,438
Who are you?

229
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,194
-Where are you going? Great, feed Henry.
-Oh, just--

230
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,447
I got winded going up ten stairs.
I need to hit a gym.

231
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,032
[Joe] Shit.

232
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,789
Whenever I hang with Henry,
I'm reminded of two things.

233
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,374
One, he hates me.

234
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,378
Two, I have to protect him at all costs
from what happened to me.

235
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,921
[boy 1] Joey!

236
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,841
-Where's your mama now?
-[boy 2] Run, you little bitch!

237
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,260
-Run, you little bitch!
-Come get some.

238
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,011
-What are you scared of?
-Get him!

239
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,680
Come on, Joey!

240
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,973
Open the door.

241
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,183
-You freak!
-Come get what's coming to you.

242
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,936
-[teacher] Boys! What's going on here?
-Teacher! Run!

243
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,146
[woman] Boys! What did--?

244
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,319
[knocking on door]

245
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,115
[Paulie] Hey, hey. Joe, Joe. Let me in.
Hey, it's me, it's me. Let me in.

246
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,994
Dude, you okay?

247
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,122
Bro, why do you do this to yourself?

248
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,291
-They're the ones who do it.
-You asked for it.

249
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,296
-Quit saying your mom's coming back.
-She is.

250
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,173
If she cared, would you be here?

251
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,301
-You don't understand.
-Fine.

252
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,678
Just shut up about it, okay?

253
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,931
-I don't see why--
-The rest of us are trying to deal

254
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,975
with how no one fucking wants us.

255
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:58,647
Face it. When our parents gave us up,
they threw us away forever, man.

256
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,695
[woman] Natalie!
Oh, my God, look at this place!

257
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,613
[Joe] Who are you?

258
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,784
On the surface, a realtor,
and you're good at it.

259
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,287
You wanna make things lovelier.

260
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,206
You left college early
when you met your husband,

261
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,751
tech entrepreneur Matthew Engler,

262
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,295
about whom there is even less to learn

263
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,923
unless I wanna take the word of publicists

264
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,342
paid to manicure every inch
of his online footprint.

265
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,511
Is this what you wanted?

266
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,557
Marry someone older, busy, never home

267
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,976
while you sell houses to rich assholes

268
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,022
and pick up his dry cleaning?
Is that love for you?

269
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,815
Do you love him?

270
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,319
Do you long for something deeper, true?

271
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,112
Like I do.

272
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,367
-[Andrew] I know.
-[Kiki] I think someone--

273
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,453
-Like, I think maybe...
-[Sherry] Oh, Love Quinn!

274
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,455
Come hither. [chuckles]

275
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,875
-Hi.
-Hi. This is Kiki, and this is Andrew.

276
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,794
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

277
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,339
Love's gorgeous baby boy is,
what, seven months?

278
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,091
-[Love] Yeah.
-Oh, I miss that age.

279
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:11,178
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Love, I was glad to see you in class.

280
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,722
-Fucking kicked my ass.
-Oh, I know.

281
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,933
That class is for really fit people,

282
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,977
but you'll get used to it.

283
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,356
-I had so much baby weight to lose.
-Same. I had quite the journey.

284
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,817
I mean, much worse than yours.

285
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,527
It was. It really was.

286
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,823
Is it just me
or is everyone calling me fat?

287
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,200
-Oh, oh, no.
-No, no, no.

288
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,619
And would that even be a pejorative?

289
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,664
I mean, beauty doesn't have a size, Love.

290
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,125
Come latte with us.

291
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,002
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

292
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,170
Okay.

293
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,173
-Yeah, I could go for some coffee.
-Amazing.

294
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,134
Great! We got a group.

295
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,260
[Sherry laughs]

296
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,894
[Joe] I might not have solved
the mystery of you yet,

297
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,274
but I know one thing:
I wasn't wrong to be intrigued.

298
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,612
Forgive the pun.
This speaks volumes about you.

299
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,782
I didn't even know
this hell-burb had a library.

300
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:25,127
Libraries represent
the very best of civilized society,

301
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,256
the housing of an egalitarian access
to knowledge.

302
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,217
It's what separates us from the apes.

303
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,807
And yet, it physically hurts to see
the condition of most of these books.

304
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,810
Mr. Mooney once said
the way a society treats its books

305
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,520
is the most accurate harbinger
of its fate.

306
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,189
You see enough broken bindings,

307
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,692
you know that Rome's burning
or will be soon enough.

308
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,864
But there's still something to fight for
in this wretched world.

309
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, what's little man's name?

310
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,621
-Oh, it's Henry.
-I dated a Henry.

311
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,249
-Henrys are great.
-Well, Henry thanks you.

312
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,501
Excuse us.

313
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,836
Hard to be invisible
with the greatest lady magnet

314
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,589
in the history of the species
strapped to you.

315
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,431
The Fifth Season, Gone Girl, Seabiscuit.

316
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,392
Okay, I'm stumped. Why those?

317
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,019
-Who are you?
-[Henry crying]

318
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,063
Oh, Henry, okay.

319
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,201
All right, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

320
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,327
[Henry stops crying]

321
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,376
-Hi.
-So are you gonna chase after her,

322
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,003
-or could I help you with something?
-Yeah.

323
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,966
-I'd like to apply for a library card.
-You've come to the right place.

324
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,175
Good.

325
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,636
Fill that out for me.

326
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,807
We have a great kids section
just in the corner.

327
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,727
And... you can take that home with you.

328
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,231
Natalie picked it out for you.

329
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,737
[Joe] You are flirting with me.

330
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,322
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

331
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,956
When they start to crawl,
it's a miracle anyone survives.

332
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,334
I'm so blessed
we have three incredible nannies.

333
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,504
Oh, my God.
It's twice as insane with twins.

334
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,923
It's kind of why I started writing.
To just share.

335
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,802
So others won't make
the mountain of mistakes I did.

336
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,263
Yeah. What is the name of your blog again?

337
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,432
[Kiki] Oh, she's Heart-Shaped Mistakes.

338
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,726
-You seriously haven't read it?
-No.

339
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,228
-It's small.
-She invented momfluencing.

340
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,938
-Don't be humble.
-No. It's fun.

341
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,817
I can stay home with my twins.
What do you do for work?

342
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:01,366
-Well, I used to-- I'm trained as a chef.
-Oh.

343
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah, and I, uh...

344
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,664
I haven't really had much time
since he was born, I guess.

345
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,459
-Well, yes.
-Your job right now is to connect

346
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,960
with your baby and your man.

347
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,714
So easy for you to say.
Has your vagina even recovered yet?

348
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,426
-Oh, my God. You're embarrassing her.
-Don't be vagina-phobic.

349
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:25,098
God! I wish someone would've told me.
Sex is hard to get back into.

350
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,353
-But connecting intimately? So crucial.
-[Andrew] Mm-hm.

351
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,814
Endorphins, oxytocin,
it's incredible for the breast milk.

352
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,609
In fact, if you're not orgasming,

353
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,238
your breast milk isn't doing it
for your baby's precious growing brain.

354
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,158
-Well, we're all over that, so...
-Oh.

355
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,076
Okay.

356
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,501
[Joe] Tender Is the Night is widely
considered Fitzgerald's darkest work.

357
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,670
It's about marriage and infidelity.

358
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,089
Invitation? Or a warning?

359
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,591
-Okay. I finally got him down.
-Mm. Good work.

360
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,512
And I got you...

361
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,765
a pain au chocolat.

362
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,269
[Joe] Don't get me wrong.
This isn't some German fairy tale

363
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,772
where a witch keeps me locked up
till it's time to eat me.

364
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,692
Love is nice, giving.

365
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,113
I fell in love
with a certain version of her.

366
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,574
What do you think?

367
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,916
-It's okay.
-Exactly. This is the best bakery in town?

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,585
Shoddy lamination. Too sweet.

369
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,839
-Definitely didn't use French butter.
-Yeah. Yeah, banish them.

370
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,174
Off with their heads. Done.

371
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,022
-Hi.
-Hi.

372
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,075
Am I interrupting your reading?

373
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,162
-No, no. No, you're not.
-Seems like I am.

374
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,080
-Just come back. Come back, Love.
-Fuck.

375
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,832
-Stay. Stay.
-No, Joe. Why?

376
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,254
-Why won't you talk to me?
-What? We talk--

377
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,673
Something is going on.
You're always distracted.

378
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,800
-I'm not distracted.
-Why won't you tell me?

379
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,011
[Henry crying over monitor]

380
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,930
I've got him.

381
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,271
I'm gonna take him to his grandma's.

382
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,565
-Love.
-No, don't worry about it, Joe.

383
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,609
Enjoy the quiet.

384
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,294
[Joe] Where are you?

385
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,504
[cell phone buzzing]

386
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,685
-Hello.
-[Natalie] Hey, neighbor.

387
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,187
Care for a drink?

388
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,816
How'd you get my number?

389
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,443
My husband, Matthew, works in tech.

390
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,488
So...

391
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,699
not at all invasive tech.

392
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,202
Why are you nervous?

393
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,663
Got some checkered past
you're trying to hide?

394
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,542
No, I'm not worried about me so much as...

395
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,879
you know, the future of civilization.

396
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,381
Ah.

397
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,217
Well, that's a lost cause.

398
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,304
You know, I feel I should warn you.

399
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,016
There's no such thing
as privacy in Madre Linda.

400
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,518
Including here.

401
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,645
See.

402
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,731
All the cameras in my house.

403
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,653
One out here is broken. That's why
I spend so much time by the pool.

404
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,950
It's the only place in this entire town
I don't feel like I'm being watched.

405
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,202
Boop. Boop.

406
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,371
There.

407
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,914
[Joe] You want us to be alone?

408
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,583
Even that's not really privacy.

409
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,043
Matthew will see I turned them off
and wonder why.

410
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,339
It's so weird,
I don't remember putting on a leash,

411
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,424
just kind of...

412
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,302
slipped around my neck at some point.

413
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,429
[Joe] You're a prisoner too.

414
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,599
I guess
marriage isn't really built for secrets.

415
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,185
Or people aren't really built
for marriage.

416
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,147
Come with.

417
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,232
I need another drink.

418
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,371
To new friends.

419
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,585
"Who can often have
a better time together than old."

420
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,629
-You got my book.
-Hmm.

421
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,006
-Oh, shit.
-Whoa.

422
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,801
Here. Is that okay? Can I see it?

423
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,225
Aye. Just put pressure on it.
That should stop the bleeding.

424
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,689
Do you have a first aid kit?

425
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,358
Yeah.

426
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,028
[Joe] It feels right.

427
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,655
Taking care of you.

428
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,367
There. I think you'll live.

429
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,037
-Does it hurt?
-Nothing more wine won't cure.

430
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,716
You feel it too, don't you?

431
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,801
What?

432
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,222
That feeling
when you're first with someone.

433
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,267
All the tension, possibility...

434
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,018
I wish I could bottle it.

435
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,188
It's better than anything.

436
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,189
[Joe] I feel it.

437
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,153
I thought it would stay, with Matthew.

438
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,575
Do you think it inevitably goes away?

439
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,076
I think if it's right...

440
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,204
it stays.

441
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,250
So how long did it stay with you and Love?

442
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,296
It's hard to say. Um...

443
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,631
I didn't know the real her...

444
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,342
when I fell in love.

445
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,511
-I know how that feels.
-I got swept up.

446
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,430
By the time I realized, it was too late.

447
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,768
I couldn't leave. I couldn't leave her.

448
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,771
People leave all the time.

449
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,152
Not Love.

450
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,197
Our daughter-- We thought
we were gonna have a little girl.

451
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,407
Anyway...

452
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,993
I'm in it now...

453
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,828
with Love.

454
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,371
Are you?

455
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,418
Kids aren't handcuffs.

456
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,504
Matthew has a stepson.

457
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,176
-We don't see him much.
-That sounds terrible, for the kid.

458
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,927
It's fine, actually.

459
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,054
You know why?

460
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,806
People are happier
when they aren't lying to themselves...

461
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,225
and everyone else.

462
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,977
So, what are you doing here?

463
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,730
[groans]

464
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,525
-I can't leave him either.
-Oh!

465
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,404
I can't do that to him.

466
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,241
Even if it means I stay in this...

467
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,580
Dwell Magazine, Twilight Zone
fucking purgatory forever.

468
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,458
-Is it that bad here?
-Ha.

469
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,710
If you're not careful,

470
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,923
you'll start caring about private schools,

471
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,884
stock portfolios,
start reading on a Kindle.

472
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,802
Fuck.

473
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,928
[Natalie chuckles]

474
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,187
You wanna see my reading room?

475
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,446
We've always slept in separate rooms.

476
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,281
I'm an insomniac.

477
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,159
Also, a slob.

478
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,542
[Joe] Everything suddenly feels real.

479
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,170
I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?

480
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,005
Hey, where'd you go?

481
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,258
Get out of your head.

482
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,219
Come here.

483
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,409
[Joe] No. Husband, father. I can't.

484
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,326
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,829
I gave you the wrong impression.

486
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,832
-I'm pretty sure you didn't.
-No.

487
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,878
I'm just looking for a friend.

488
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
Shit.

489
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,930
[Joe] No, never again.

490
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,225
-I promised myself I would do this right.
-[door closes]

491
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,644
Love. Hey, I thought--

492
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,396
I got there...

493
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,941
and then I thought about seeing my mom,

494
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,819
and I went and got Häagen-Dazs instead.

495
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,324
Are you okay? You look a little flushed.

496
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,285
I just had a drink with the neighbor.

497
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,245
-Hmm. [chuckles]
-You're right. She's crazy.

498
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,832
Look, I'm sorry for running off.

499
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,917
I just--

500
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,469
I was just thinking about our vows.

501
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,555
Oh. Yeah.

502
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,559
The ones we wrote on In-N-Out bags
on the way to the courthouse.

503
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,147
You said you would always share a bite
of your pastry with me.

504
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,817
That's-- That's so generous.

505
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,612
-I am generous.
-You really are, and I'm an asshole.

506
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,324
-No, you're not. You're just--
-I am. And it's been so crazy.

507
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,328
And I was just thinking about that bite.

508
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,624
And you were hungry?

509
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,169
-Yeah.
-Me too.

510
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,629
[dramatic music playing]

511
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,055
[Joe] That feeling you wanna bottle,

512
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,391
turns out, it can come back.

513
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,852
Maybe this is what we were looking for
in each other, Natalie.

514
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,520
What I needed from you.

515
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,189
A way back to Love.

516
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,567
Maybe, thanks to you,

517
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,318
I can make this work.

518
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,282
[moaning]

519
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,377
I should have told Sherry we were busy.
This is gonna suck.

520
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,921
Something tells me
she's not someone you say no to.

521
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,548
It'll be fine.

522
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,884
-[doorbell rings]
-I have you...

523
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,011
and pie.

524
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,180
-Quinn-Goldbergs.
-[Love] Hey.

525
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,434
-Step right on up.
-Here you go. This is for you.

526
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
-It's gluten-free.
-Oh, great.

527
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,145
Yes.

528
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
[Joe] Fun fact,
Sherry had to post an apology video

529
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,275
in August 2020 after it was discovered

530
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,069
that she had a massive party
while the rest of us were home,

531
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,988
clutching hand sanitizer.

532
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,116
Rumor was, the whole neighborhood got
a secret vaccine

533
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,494
manufactured for the Queen of England
and were thus immune to COVID.

534
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,080
I don't believe in conspiracies,

535
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,375
except when they're about
unfair advantages of being rich.

536
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,170
Those are true.
Trust me, I married a Quinn.

537
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,840
Go get you some Pinot.
It's from my friends' winery.

538
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,343
They 3D-print their wine barrels.

539
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,595
Hi.

540
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,764
[indistinct chatter]

541
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,935
Thank you.

542
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,939
Oh, that's Kiki and her husband, Brandon.

543
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,401
And there's Andrew and his lawyer husband.

544
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,028
I can't remember his name.

545
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,529
Jackson.

546
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,954
Andrew, Jackson. Now, that is unfortunate.

547
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,789
Oh, my God.

548
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,834
-How could I forget?
-They seem okay,

549
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,545
if you discount the obscene
one-percenter bubble they live in.

550
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,758
Mm. I have to discount that
or we'd have to guillotine both of us too.

551
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,593
Then they're a nice couple.

552
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,637
[Sherry laughing]

553
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,306
Contrary to our gracious host.

554
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,016
[Joe] Never trust a queen bee.

555
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,143
Let me show you around, Love.

556
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,853
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

557
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,189
[Cary] Ah, you must be Joe.

558
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,942
Finally, we meet. Cary Conrad.

559
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:11,406
'Cause is your life even a brand
without a perfectly imperfect soulmate?

560
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,699
Oh, my God.

561
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,661
Mission accomplished. I cannot tell
who the bigger douchebag is.

562
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,747
-Nice to meet you.
-Let me show you the grill setup.

563
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,332
Okay.

564
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,213
A sea of awkward nerds made good.
Tech made the money, wives did the rest.

565
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,840
Clothes, hair, Barry's Bootcamp,

566
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:33,386
and they go from kid-stuffed-in-locker
to 21st-century master of the universe.

567
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,264
-It's kind of sweet.
-Kiki tells Dakota, "Don't bother Daddy.

568
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,517
He's micro-dosing ketamine.
It's his special time."

569
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,978
[Joe] If you overlook the haze
of narcissistic delusion

570
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,271
that just the right biohack,

571
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,564
you'll live forever.

572
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,942
It's all paleo. Well, keto, really.

573
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,362
I find when I I.F.,
I'm good on any amount of fats.

574
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,406
-I.F.?
-Intermittent fasting.

575
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,199
You don't?

576
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:00,580
Well, I mean, obviously you must not
because you're genetically blessed.

577
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,915
Let me get in there.

578
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,500
Oh, yeah.

579
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,753
Lucky. Super high metab.

580
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,882
The guys come and train with me.
I'm a monster. You'll love it.

581
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,302
[Joe] Is he flirting with me
or inviting me to join Fight Club?

582
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,845
Help yourself to meat.

583
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,055
I'll be back.

584
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,227
I didn't know
Lena and Chris were back from Paris.

585
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,981
Oh, and apparently had the best time.

586
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,233
-They're open, the marriage.
-[Love] Oh.

587
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,195
No judgment from me.

588
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,821
Really?

589
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,741
-None?
-I spent my summers growing up

590
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,952
on a commune,
so I got a big dose of all that.

591
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,746
Whatever works, right?

592
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,541
You are such a breath of fresh air, Love.

593
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,043
I'm glad you moved here.

594
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,339
-My pleasure.
-Oh.

595
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,465
Hi.

596
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,634
Natalie and Matthew Engler.

597
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,137
-Oh, she looks amazing.
-She is a bad person.

598
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,101
Matthew was married
to this incredible woman named Mimi,

599
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,104
mother of his child, and then, well--

600
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,688
He met Natalie, and--

601
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,400
We're far too feminist
to ever say a woman stole a man.

602
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,655
She's nice enough.
Great realtor, you know. A cheater.

603
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,907
Good to know
when a person lives next door.

604
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,825
[Kiki] Mm-hm.

605
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,578
Oh, I must say hello to Les.
He's sourcing us a French bulldog.

606
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,705
-I'm empty. I'm gonna go fill up.
-Okay.

607
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,380
[Joe] You're here, with him?

608
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,257
Looking perfectly content.

609
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,094
Was our evening nothing?
A mistake for us both?

610
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,432
Ever sat in a virtual reality pod?

611
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,977
-Joe?
-No, I can't say that I have.

612
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,313
Oh, Cary's got one in his garage.
It's insane.

613
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,151
Not even just for porn.
But also the porn is spectacular.

614
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,696
[Joe] We as a species
deserve to go extinct.

615
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,615
[women laughing]

616
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,827
So my friend Rachel in L.A.,

617
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,790
she said the brother's a crackhead
who got himself killed.

618
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,460
And the dad's shady too.
Apparently, Anavrin is a front.

619
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,754
Money just papers over that garbage fire.

620
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,050
And, of course, she took her daddy's cash,
bought a whole new life here,

621
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,845
where the rest of us work
for what we have.

622
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,430
-[Kiki] Amen.
-[Sherry] Amen.

623
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,347
Hi.

624
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,808
Can I top off your wine?

625
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,561
-Hi.
-[Sherry] Oh, my God!

626
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,478
Okay.

627
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:37,069
May I state the obvious?
Sherry Conrad is a terrible person.

628
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,033
-Can you fucking believe that?
-Who runs this town, so...

629
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,828
you kind of can't
get righteously indignant

630
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,748
unless you also wanna be lonely.

631
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,501
Well, I have friends.

632
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,587
Where, in L.A.?

633
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,924
You need some here too.

634
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,010
I assume you came here for the schools?

635
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,013
Well, now, you know those come at a cost.

636
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,848
Pinot, please.

637
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,769
Look, they hate me.

638
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,232
Think I stole Matthew from their friend,
who by the way, was cheating first, but...

639
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,901
Point is,

640
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,904
everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

641
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,325
You mean, around Sherry and her mafia?

642
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,495
It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

643
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,415
They just called my family a garbage fire.
I don't really see that happening.

644
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,625
Okay. Fair.

645
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,672
So do what I do. Get her to respect you.

646
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,424
Authenticity scares the shit out of her.

647
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:45,096
Do you, no apology, loud and proud,
and you'll cow her into,

648
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,141
if not submission,
at least basic fake friendship.

649
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:54,313
Okay, great. One problem.
I don't really know who I am these days.

650
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,778
I just had a baby,

651
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,863
and everything's a--

652
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,159
There's nothing authentic
or intimidating about me.

653
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,829
I'm just a stay-at-home mom going insane.

654
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,167
I guess there's some...

655
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,045
things I need to figure out.

656
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,506
So if you could do anything,

657
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,800
what would you do?

658
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,759
Just for fun?

659
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,178
Okay.

660
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,848
So this is stupid.

661
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,060
But I have this fantasy
of opening a bakery.

662
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,105
I'm a trained pastry chef in another life,

663
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,525
and feels ridiculous to think about
in a town where nobody eats gluten.

664
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,651
I eat gluten.

665
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,736
Seriously?

666
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,363
You know what?

667
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,908
There's a space available
that might be perfect.

668
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,452
Could be wrong.

669
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,246
Or this was fate.

670
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,373
Call me if you ever wanna see it.

671
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,792
Thank you.

672
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,381
It's really nice
to have an actual conversation.

673
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,925
I can't believe
we've been living next door for months.

674
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,511
Joe's seen more of you than I have.

675
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,055
Oh, not really.

676
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,642
I keep telling Matthew, I'd love to have
you both over for a drink sometime.

677
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,937
It's crazy, we haven't had
either of you at the house yet.

678
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,314
We'll do it soon.

679
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,234
Yeah, that sounds great.

680
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,320
Definitely.

681
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,155
[Joe] What is wrong?

682
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,366
I have been doing everything
for this family,

683
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,242
and you've been fucking the neighbor.

684
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,288
-What? Wait, what are you talking about?
-I'm not an idiot, Joe!

685
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,664
I'm not having an--

686
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,210
Look, I don't know what she said,
but I told you the truth.

687
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,421
We had a drink.
She started acting a little crazy. I left.

688
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,841
Then you came home and fucked me
for the first time in six months.

689
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,386
-What is that? A coincidence?
-Fine. I like that she flirted.

690
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,679
Is that what we're doing now?
Policing each other's minds?

691
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,391
-Are we not allowed to have a fantasy?
-Don't give me that.

692
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,519
There's nothing simple about it
when somebody gets stuck in your mind.

693
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,687
-I don't care if you fucked her.
-Sounds like you care.

694
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,022
Are you obsessed with her?

695
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,317
-It's not like that.
-Really?

696
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,111
-Yeah.
-You sure?

697
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,656
I'm sure. Because it was like that
with you, Love! I married you.

698
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,409
The man I fell in love with would do
anything for the ones he loves.

699
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,744
I still would. I moved here.

700
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,123
We're in this fake, plastic suburban hell.

701
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:21,544
-We moved here for the baby.
-He was supposed to be a girl.

702
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,755
What does that fucking matter?

703
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,383
I don't even-- I-- I don't-- It doesn't.

704
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,136
It feels so emblematic
of getting it wrong,

705
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,514
of feeling like I am gonna
fuck him up. Like he knows.

706
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,599
He looks at me like I'm a monster.

707
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,352
How do you think I feel?

708
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,731
You remember what Forty said.
Five seconds before he died.

709
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,445
That I'd be crazy if I ever thought
I could be a good mother.

710
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,656
Well, he was out of his mind.

711
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,577
Maybe he wasn't.

712
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,166
We...

713
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:02,960
both...

714
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,838
have done bad things.

715
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,634
I wanted to move here so that...

716
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,137
we could start new...

717
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,808
be safe and never have
to do anything bad ever again.

718
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,519
We get to choose.

719
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,605
We get to choose. We are safe now.

720
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,106
We're together.

721
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,108
I promise, no more.

722
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,946
No more bad things ever again, okay?

723
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,658
While we're telling the truth,

724
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,119
you are a great mother.

725
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,580
Thanks.

726
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,297
Does that mean
I can stop reading Sherry's shitty blog?

727
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,263
There's still time to bond with him.

728
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,477
Try reading him something
other than Fitzgerald. He is a baby.

729
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,981
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

730
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,904
Should we go home?

731
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,323
Yeah, let's go home.

732
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,001
-[Henry crying]
-[humming]

733
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,547
-Hey, are we okay?
-Hey.

734
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,507
-He's been great all night.
-Okay.

735
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,927
Go get some rest. I got him.
Really. I got him. I got him.

736
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,637
-Thank you, thank you.
-Good night.

737
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,347
-Thank you, thank you.
-I love you, Forty.

738
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,431
Oh.

739
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,517
You're okay, Henry.

740
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,438
"Happily ever after" looks
a lot different than I thought.

741
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,488
And a family, the reality of one,

742
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,240
might not be for everyone...

743
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,494
but it's all I've ever wanted.

744
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,832
So I'm gonna make this work.
No matter what it takes.

745
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,171
Goodbye, you.

746
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,055
[upbeat music playing]

747
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,271
[man] Nineteen bucks? It's crazy.
I'll give you 2 bucks.

748
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:31,275
This isn't a pawnshop, sir.
We don't negotiate late fees.

749
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,153
Manager. I wanna speak to a manager.

750
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:56,759
[sighs]

751
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,346
Hi, Natalie.

752
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:02,931
Yep.

753
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,770
Yeah, I wanted to see that place
you were talking about for a bakery.

754
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,316
Amazing.

755
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,738
"But he could not think
of a story to tell Frog.

756
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,448
Then...

757
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,532
Uh...

758
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,703
Toad poured a glass of water
over his head."

759
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,960
Am I the asshole here?
I'm sorry. That's a bad word.

760
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,588
Is it me?

761
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,550
I'm trying.

762
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,346
I'm in over my head.

763
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,933
He said, using an idiom
his son will never understand

764
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,435
because it's impossible
to communicate with babies.

765
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,395
[coos]

766
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,897
Yeah, right. Exactly.

767
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,232
[babbling]

768
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,325
How are we supposed
to understand each other?

769
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,162
How am I supposed to do this right?

770
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,125
I wanna do this right, Forty--

771
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,835
Henry. Henry.

772
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:13,919
Henry, you see?

773
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,755
You're getting into my head.

774
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm gonna do everything I can.

775
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,101
I just don't know what that means yet.

776
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,561
I...

777
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,939
[laughing]

778
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,782
So wait, you don't hate me?

779
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,159
[babbles]

780
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,749
Yeah, same here.

781
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,625
Same here.

782
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,919
Okay. Yeah, it's a good talk.

783
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,546
[clearing throat]

784
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,131
Yeah, let's keep reading.

785
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,049
Uh...

786
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,136
"'Why are you pouring water
over your head?' asked Frog.

787
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:10,309
'I hope that if I pour water over my head,
it will help me to think of a story.'"

788
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,610
It's cute, right?

789
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,154
Build-out's already mostly done for you.

790
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,952
And the tenant left all the appliances?

791
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,121
Kind of had to.

792
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,290
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

793
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,043
This town isn't exactly
the easiest market.

794
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,086
Your stuff has to be good.

795
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,548
-That, I'm not worried about.
-Then nothing to worry about.

796
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,718
Except landlord has another offer.

797
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:51,016
But he loves me, so sign
a 3-year lease today and you're golden.

798
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,062
I already sent you papers to e-sign.

799
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,069
-Can I--? Can I see downstairs?
-Yeah, let's go.

800
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,268
Okay, so I know how it looks,

801
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,145
but I was told this is
the best walk-in freezer on the market.

802
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,816
Let me show you the other storage room.

803
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,915
Permits are easy.

804
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,085
So you can have
this place up and running crazy fast.

805
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,892
[moaning]

806
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,226
[dramatic music playing]

807
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:47,883
Bottom line, in the right hands,
this place could be a raging success.

808
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,469
So, what do you think? [gasps]

809
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,642
This is just the beginning, Henry.

810
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,645
Frog and Toad are great. But wait
until you meet Pippi Longstocking.

811
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,271
-[cell phone buzzing]
-You'll freak out.

812
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,148
I'm just leaving the library. What's up?

813
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,650
[Love sobbing]

814
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,946
Hey, Love. You okay?

815
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,491
Um, Joe.

816
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,868
What's wrong?

817
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,412
I think we need to go to couples' therapy.

818
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,555
[theme music playing]
