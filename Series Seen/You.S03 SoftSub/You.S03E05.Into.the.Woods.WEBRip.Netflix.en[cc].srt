1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,644
[Joe] Previously on You:

2
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,105
[Love] I have a plan.

3
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,025
[reporter] Mrs. Engler was involved
in an extramarital relationship

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,318
with Gil Brigham.

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,071
In a written letter, Mr. Brigham confessed

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,323
that he murdered Mrs. Engler
and disposed of her remains.

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,533
Find the people that get you.

8
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,161
-How do you know who those people are?
-You just do.

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,457
[Joe] I can't be thinking
about you like this. No.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,167
You okay there, Joe?

11
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,961
[Joe] Oh, no. This is bad.

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,717
We've really turned a corner.
We barely fight anymore.

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,722
And when we disagree,
we discuss it directly, then we move on.

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,098
Guess you could say we're just

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,893
-a normal, boring suburban family.
-Whoo!

16
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,144
[Joe] She said boring. Not me.

17
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,395
Everything's fine.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,439
[Joe] Sure, little bit of a yawn.

19
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,985
Oh, it's been six months.

20
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,783
-And we don't know how to say this.
-[Joe] Come on, Love. Spit it out.

21
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,409
Do we need to keep coming?

22
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,205
I know we're already down
to every other week,

23
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,791
but we rarely have anything
to talk about with you.

24
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,125
[Joe] Or with each other.

25
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,418
Is this financial?

26
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,589
We talked about your mom buying
the vineyard and you feeling strapped.

27
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,300
-No, business is good.
-Love is being modest.

28
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,719
The bakery is a huge success.

29
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,640
I can't believe I'm so happy here.

30
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,434
[Joe] I'd never call Love a pod person,

31
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,978
but let's just say she's assimilated.

32
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,482
-Joe? How have you been?
-[Joe] Oh, I'm fine.

33
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,276
Bored, trapped in Pleasantville,
aging so fast,

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,654
I forget to jack off in the shower.

35
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,571
I'm good.

36
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,532
Work is good.

37
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,995
-Uh, I've really gotten into lawn care.
-Oh, my God.

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,708
-He is obsessed with the lawn.
-The lawn is the foyer to the home.

39
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,588
[Joe]
My love of our glorious foyer is genuine.

40
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:15,677
After Gil, I realized there's a price
to pay if you want a stable life.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
And I am happy

42
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,684
to forego excitement and chaos for that,
to be the husband and father I want to be.

43
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,897
I can do it, for Henry. I'm great at it.
Lawn mowers are very fun.

44
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,317
Joe's been having
a harder time making friends here.

45
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,527
[Joe] Excuse me?

46
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,656
I have plenty of friends.
I do, at the library.

47
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,827
-Any friends you don't work with?
-[Joe] Well, no.

48
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,620
Everyone else is an asshole.

49
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,497
Let me tell you what Love is not saying.

50
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,126
Not having friends puts
a lot of pressure on a partner.

51
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,671
-Do you feel pressure, Love?
-Yes.

52
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,589
[Joe] She does?

53
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,633
One person cannot fulfill all our needs.

54
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,095
It's crucial to have friends
outside a marriage.

55
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,347
It takes some of that pressure off.

56
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,476
[Joe] I don't see great candidates
for BFF here in Madre Linda, but...

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,394
Okay.

58
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,480
I will try harder.

59
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,692
I'm annoyed, but promises are easy
when your priorities are clear.

60
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,028
Make our marriage work.

61
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,780
So our time's almost up, but I should ask.

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,241
How's your sex life been?

63
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,701
-It's good.
-It's great.

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,871
It's great. I should have said great.

65
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,250
[Love moaning]

66
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,253
Wait.

67
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,130
Ah. Not again.

68
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,381
Hold on, I just--

69
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,926
-I need a sec.
-Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

70
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,096
I'm tired anyway.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,195
Remember what we used to say? I wolf you.

72
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah.

73
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,536
We should bring that back.

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,789
[Joe]
We also never rip each other's clothes off

75
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,540
and fuck like wildcats anymore.

76
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,417
We've been domesticated.

77
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
-I'm sorry about--
-No, it's fine.

78
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,633
I wolf you.

79
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,969
[chuckles]

80
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,100
[Joe] Wolf? We're dog-on-a-leash now.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,310
This is fine. It's normal.

82
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,270
It's fine.

83
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,564
And if it feels like it's not,
maybe I'm the problem.

84
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,784
[Joe] Maybe you and Dr. Chandra are right.

85
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,371
My introvert tendencies are
the reason I feel off.

86
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,916
Joe, mm, can you tilt your chin forward?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,836
[Joe] But did you have
to make Sherry your best friend?

88
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,045
Oh, my God.

89
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,674
The camera is loving Henry's authenticity.

90
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,846
Um-- Guys, are we sure
puppies is the right theme for the party?

91
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm not usually indecisive. It's just--

92
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,309
Sherry keeps saying that...

93
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,395
[Joe] Parties indicate your child
and family are socially adjusted

94
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,148
and an integral part of the community.

95
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,776
And a critical part
of getting into The Ashman School,

96
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,738
Madre Linda's premiere private Pre-K.

97
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,781
-Shoot me.
-We're doing everything right.

98
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,367
Joe, no one wants
to go to a birthday party

99
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,412
where Daddy looks
like a Cymbalta commercial, okay?

100
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,248
So, Love, let's get
some singles over here,

101
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,000
and, Joe, just shake it off.

102
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,294
Just shake it off.

103
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,795
Come on.

104
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,382
[Joe] Something about fitting
into suburbia has changed you, Love.

105
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,094
You went from being horrified
by the ostentatiousness of a kids party

106
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,638
-to Keeping Up With The Conrads.
-[Sherry] The other side.

107
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,393
[Joe] And yet, you make belonging look
so effortless.

108
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,479
-You do seem happy.
-[Sherry] No Cymbalta here.

109
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,023
[Joe] Why do I still feel
so on the outside?

110
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,692
Joe, come over here, sweetie.
The vibe is much better.

111
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,153
[pop music playing over speakers]

112
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,281
-Wow.
-Oh, yeah.

113
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,825
I think Theo's visiting home.

114
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,243
Theo.

115
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,299
Yes! Yes!

116
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,467
Finally!

117
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,970
We got it.
These invitations are gonna be adorable.

118
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,555
Yeah.

119
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,560
-Thank you so much, Sherry. Really.
-Yeah.

120
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,854
Joe, I like it when you appreciate me.

121
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,900
[Marienne] Oh, my gosh.

122
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,902
If you could see his hair.

123
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,031
Mari, do me the favor of describing.

124
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,074
Oh, my.

125
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:48,991
Okay.

126
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:55,331
Whole vibe's very
Patrick-Bateman-meets-Venetian-gondolier.

127
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,585
Oh, okay. Right. Let me just go fix it.

128
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,296
Oh, no, no. No. Wait, wait.

129
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,425
Dante, cover the floor?

130
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,178
Okay, here's one.

131
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:14,392
Favorite classic fantasy series.
Let's say 1970s through '90s?

132
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay. Give me a minute.

133
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,566
Yes, I notice Marienne in that way,
but I cut it off instantly.

134
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,276
I'm married, so she and I are friends.

135
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,778
Am I supposed to feel bad
that I'm friends with people at work?

136
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,239
Dragonriders of Pern, maybe.

137
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,157
Okay.

138
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,369
But, you know, as a kid, I hid them.
I was afraid they were for girls.

139
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,957
Why? It's dragons fighting space worms.
That is not gender-specific.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,711
-Trying to fit in is the worst.
-[Joe] Exactly.

141
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,298
-How is this helping your portrait?
-Who said I was doing a portrait?

142
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,134
Well, I mean, I guess, sort of.

143
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,304
I had been working on this sketch
of the Little Prince and the Fox.

144
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,600
Couldn't get the Fox,
and your vibe today inspired me.

145
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,770
It's for this illustration contest
put on by this fancy imprint,

146
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,191
and this year, it's reinterpret
a classic of children's lit.

147
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,944
"It's the time you lavished on your rose

148
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,240
that makes your rose so important."

149
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,825
Hmm.

150
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,583
Um, anyway, I probably won't
even submit, so...

151
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:25,505
You have a habit of talking yourself out
of things. Is this something you do often?

152
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,008
All right, Sigmund Freud,
sit back and sit still, please.

153
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,595
I thought this wasn't a portrait.

154
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,850
-So why The Little Prince?
-Just always loved it.

155
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,436
Translations never do it justice,

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,606
but the original will always be
my favorite.

157
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,732
Do you speak French?

158
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,609
[speaking French]

159
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,572
-My first language. I was born in Paris.
-You don't have an accent.

160
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,408
You wanna be friends
with people who can surprise you.

161
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,244
I moved when I was young,

162
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,998
and it's really just
not that interesting a story, so...

163
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,208
[Joe] Maybe to her.

164
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,960
Why so wary?

165
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,420
So scared to be seen.

166
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,385
That's what I want in friends,
to be inspired to wonder.

167
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,302
[Marienne] Joe?

168
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,263
-[Joe] Who is she?
-Show me.

169
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,057
Your drawing.

170
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,157
It's going to be beautiful.

171
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,079
-Thank you.
-Marienne, you have to submit this.

172
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,424
No, no, no.

173
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,802
Did I learn nothing from Natalie?
Why am I holding this?

174
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,971
Put the bracelet down.

175
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,058
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

176
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,023
I mean, you look paler than usual,
and that's saying something.

177
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
No, everything's fine.

178
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,527
Okay.

179
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,530
[Joe] Shit. Feeling drawn
to Marienne is just a symptom.

180
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,577
The problem is me, running away from
my perfectly good life and devoted wife.

181
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,957
So, if I'm the problem, how do I fix it?

182
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,255
Smells good, bro.

183
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,179
But the key to truly orgasmic BBQ
is catching the meat yourself.

184
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,555
Yeah, you mentioned.

185
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,556
Six times.

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,476
But it's okay because look at you.

187
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,603
Happy wife, happy life, right?

188
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,022
What could say more about my commitment

189
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,025
than agreeing to dinner
with the fucking Conrads?

190
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,653
If putting up with Cro-Magnon man gets
the tips you need

191
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,783
to make Henry's party a success,
I'm all in because I am all in, damn it.

192
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,867
[Sherry and Love laughing]

193
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,871
-Are you sure you don't want a top off?
-Ugh. It won't kill me.

194
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,997
[Love chuckles]

195
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,208
Ugh.

196
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,502
That one.

197
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:17,802
I heard he's on probation at school
for showing up to a midterm drunk.

198
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,928
-Oh.
-Thanks.

199
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
Imagine what his grades look like.

200
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,474
Actually, I thought he was doing okay.

201
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,602
That one's determined to self-destruct.

202
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,439
He got arrested in high school, two DUIs.

203
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,692
Just a matter of time before he starts
cooking meth like Jessica Sherman,

204
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,486
winds up dead in a ditch.

205
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,071
Mm.

206
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,158
I mean, he seems like a good kid
in a tough situation,

207
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,413
-but I know you know him better than I do.
-No.

208
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
No, you're right.

209
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,087
-He just needs some better influences.
-Yeah.

210
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,381
[Cary] Pretty capable in the kitchen,
Miss Quinn-Goldberg.

211
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,217
Next time we'll be hunting
the pigs ourselves.

212
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,552
Is that right?

213
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,262
That'd be my husband.

214
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,097
Better watch out, Joe.

215
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,183
Cary's gonna wind up dragging you
on his hunting trip tomorrow,

216
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,685
make you a better man.

217
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,146
[Cary] Actually, there's a spot
with your name all over it.

218
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,772
It's just what you need, my friend,

219
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,275
to recharge those masculine batteries,
if you know what I mean.

220
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,652
-[Joe] I do not.
-We hike. We hunt.

221
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,948
We don't have to restrain
our, uh, natural impulses.

222
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,324
It's an incredible feeling,

223
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,077
letting out that part of yourself
that you have to cage.

224
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,414
[Joe] Unleashing my impulses
is the opposite of what I need to do.

225
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,541
No, thank you. Hard pass.

226
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,669
It sounds great, but I do think
that we have Henry's party...

227
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,255
No, no, no. It sounds great.
You should totally go.

228
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,632
Sherry and my mom can help
with party prep.

229
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,552
Be great for you
to get to know the guys better.

230
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,554
-[doorbell rings]
-[Joe] Saved by the bell.

231
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,017
[Cary] We're almost to the day.
My brother's September 2nd.

232
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,020
-Theo.
-Hi.

233
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,022
You look nice.

234
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,359
-What are--? What are you...?
-Oh, I, um...

235
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,280
It's street cleaning tomorrow,
so thought I'd give you a heads-up.

236
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,075
Car's in the driveway.

237
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,412
Yeah, but to warn you
not to put them on the street.

238
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,917
Okay.

239
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,003
-Okay, wait. Wait, wait, Theo.
-Yeah.

240
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,215
Are--? Are you okay?

241
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,468
Yep.

242
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,512
Never better.

243
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,098
Really? Because I heard that--

244
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,975
Hey.

245
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,562
Why do I feel like I walked
into the middle of something?

246
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,568
Oh, by the way,
the lawn, it looks impeccable.

247
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,947
Richard Yates-level attention to detail.

248
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,907
[Joe] He's read Yates?

249
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,787
-He's weirder than ever, huh?
-He's not weird.

250
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,207
He's a kid. Kids are weird.
Cut him some slack, okay?

251
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,254
[Joe] Why are you acting so--? No, no, no.

252
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,299
Stop looking for trouble.
You are fine. I am the problem.

253
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,012
So why do I feel
like you're hiding something?

254
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,349
Dr. Chandra would say
I'm falling into old patterns. No.

255
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,685
I'm committed
to being a good husband and father.

256
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,853
That involves things like lawn care

257
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,148
and making sure there are
no fraudulent charges from hotels

258
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,402
where you're conducting an affair
with the stepson of the woman you killed.

259
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,239
Yeah, I know how crazy I sound...
Love! What the fuck?

260
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,784
One, two...
Twelve Uber charges in Palo Alto?

261
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,620
Are ride-shares
the seedy motels of NorCal?

262
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,958
How the fuck did I miss this?

263
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,502
Hey. He's down.

264
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,049
What? Something wrong?

265
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,138
Do you know about
these Uber charges in Palo Alto?

266
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,350
Are you asking me or accusing me?

267
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,521
I'm calling the credit card company
to cancel. I just wanted to make sure.

268
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,358
Sometimes Theo texts me when he's drunk
and I get him an Uber.

269
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,152
What?

270
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,654
Nobody looks out for him, Joe.

271
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,616
And with Matthew,
it's good to keep a line open.

272
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,497
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

273
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,084
Love?

274
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,797
-Okay, he kissed me.
-He kissed you?

275
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:28,510
Yeah. It was before he left for school.
I mean, obviously, I shut it down.

276
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,429
-That's shutting it down?
-Don't yell.

277
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,057
-You've been sneaking around.
-That's crazy.

278
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,976
You made me feel
like something's wrong with me.

279
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,064
And I've done everything you asked.
You've been lying to me this whole time!

280
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,613
What the fuck was that, Joe?

281
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,116
You are clearly not happy.

282
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,621
I hope this weekend helps you get
your shit together. Something has to.

283
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,710
[dramatic music playing]

284
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,384
[Joe] Being with men
in the woods is not my thing,

285
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,305
but I couldn't say no to you
after what I did, so here I am.

286
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,017
You can go on ahead without me if you...

287
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,604
Nah, no man left behind.

288
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:26,110
Cary and I made that pact at 'Manjaro.
He carried me up the Barranco Wall.

289
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,239
Kilimanjaro. What an amazing--
How much longer to the campsite?

290
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,075
Nothing bonds you like the altitude shits.

291
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,244
[Joe] Why is male small talk so terrible?

292
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,705
'Manjaro was such an eye-opener.
When I got back,

293
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,790
Kiki and I started unschooling the kids.

294
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,792
Unschooling?

295
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,295
It advocates for child-chosen activities

296
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,548
instead of textbook-based learning.

297
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,008
Books can be the worst.

298
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,426
Mind-confiners, right?

299
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,221
Cary's the expert, even though
Sherry's all in on The Ashman School.

300
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,890
I respect how they make it work.

301
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,435
Can I tell you something?

302
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,313
Cary saved my marriage.

303
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,319
I made all this money in my 20s.
Didn't have to work, so I stayed home.

304
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,407
I loved being the kids' unteacher.
But, also, I was...

305
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,119
I just didn't feel like a man.

306
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,079
I was angry all the time.

307
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,291
I came here broken.

308
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,295
Cary helped me embrace my inner beast.

309
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,924
To grunt and breathe and scream and...

310
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,011
And cry.

311
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,305
To let go.

312
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,683
[Joe] All's fine and well for this guy,
his inner beast's a Persian kitten.

313
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,727
Letting go is scary.

314
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,566
It's something about these woods,
with these men, that makes it feel safe.

315
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,612
I'm excited for you.
Your life's about to change.

316
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,199
[Joe] How coddled was his life
to believe he's safe among men?

317
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,827
I wasn't even safe among boys.

318
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,037
[boys chattering]

319
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,957
[Derek] You like that shit, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

320
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,711
Oh, this is so fun. This is so fun.

321
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,840
You're gonna cry for your mommy too, huh?
Just like your buddy Joe!

322
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,467
[Brandon] You okay?

323
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,350
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
I'm in worse shape than I thought.

324
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,651
...if you hadn't been snacking
the whole time...

325
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,610
You know what?

326
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,158
Welcome to the Promised Land!

327
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,662
-You went all out.
-His minions went all out.

328
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,955
Got here hours ago.

329
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,666
It started off as a hike
and ended as a run.

330
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,794
Way too much energy. Yes!

331
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,212
Claim your digs.

332
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,132
Then we'll gather more wood.
I'm glad you're here, boys.

333
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,591
Let's go.

334
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,554
Faith over fear. It's time to check out,
so we can check in.

335
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,432
Let's hydrate! We're gonna do
some sweating, boys.

336
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,188
Mm-mm.

337
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,693
Rule number two. Only food we eat
is what we kill ourselves.

338
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,947
We'll go over the rules at dusk.

339
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,824
[Joe] What is this,
Fight Club in the redwoods?

340
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,742
-I haven't eaten all day.
-Yeah.

341
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,328
Let me tell you a story.

342
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,792
One time I got caught in a 'lanche,
split-boarding at 'Hoe.

343
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,795
In the snow two hours
before they rescued me.

344
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,006
Most suffocate in five minutes.

345
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,218
If I can survive that,
pretty sure you can survive this.

346
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,806
Let me translate.

347
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,394
Cary got stuck in an avalanche in Tahoe.

348
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,355
Must we abbreviate everything? Confusing.

349
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,400
Who's got the arms to gather fuel with me?

350
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,319
I'm on it.

351
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,988
Chop-chop. Let's run.

352
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,453
Yeah! Let's do this!
Fire is life, boys. Fire is life.

353
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,456
-You actually like these trips?
-I like that Andrew likes them.

354
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,502
No, in all honesty, they really have been
a savior for our marriage.

355
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,339
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,299
How?

357
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,092
We come undone.

358
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,096
The first time I came out here,
I wept like a baby.

359
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,268
All it took was trying to make fire.
Some make it farther before they break.

360
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,437
Why would anyone wanna get to that point?

361
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,524
Your kid hasn't reached the terrible twos

362
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,277
or my personal favorite,
the fucking fours,

363
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,112
but he still has tantrums?

364
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,740
Henry's an overachiever in that area.

365
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:46,912
So don't you ever wanna scream
and cry and break shit?

366
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,708
Cary says this trip's about being a man.
I think it's about being a kid again.

367
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,626
Hmm.

368
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,254
Here.

369
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,840
You can have a meaningful experience
while maintaining

370
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,051
a normal blood-sugar level.

371
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,471
Thank you.

372
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,101
[bells chiming]

373
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,692
Hello. Welcome. What can I get you?

374
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,403
Uh, yeah, can I get one of everything?

375
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,365
Oh. I forgot my wallet again.

376
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,449
Ugh.

377
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,076
Well...

378
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,330
That's all right.

379
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,459
On the house. Study fuel.

380
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,919
Mm.

381
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,506
I'm actually taking some time off.

382
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,385
To process the whole Natalie thing.

383
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,471
You could have told me
you were struggling.

384
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,351
No, I couldn't 'cause you drew a line.

385
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,187
-No more e-mails, only Ubers.
-Right.

386
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,689
Thank you.

387
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,607
But, um...

388
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,611
I am worried about you.

389
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,072
Are you?

390
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,327
'Cause I've been worried about you.

391
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,582
I... I heard your husband yelling at you
the other night,

392
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,043
and I know that we are, like...

393
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,297
Whatever,
but if you need someone to talk to--

394
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,716
-Yeah, I have friends for that.
-Right.

395
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,052
Sherry Conrad.

396
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,181
-We have more in common than you think.
-You're both human women.

397
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,265
Totally.

398
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,976
Come on, she's, like, an inch deep.

399
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,439
You're only friends
because she's the only option in town.

400
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,316
It's not a crime to fit in, Theo.

401
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,903
Maybe you'll understand that
when you're older.

402
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,572
You've changed.

403
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,909
That's not always a bad thing.

404
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,704
Enjoy the muffins. Okay?

405
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,253
[bells chiming]

406
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,636
[Cary making animal call]

407
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,564
I learned this mating call
outside of Cartagena.

408
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,985
Three minutes later, a doe popped out
of the brush, started nuzzling my cock.

409
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,695
[Joe] Will it ever stop?

410
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,656
All right, let's go. Circle up!

411
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,200
Rules!

412
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,788
One, we already know, make our own fire.
Well done, my brothers.

413
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,705
Whoo!

414
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,583
Two, we only eat what we kill.

415
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,709
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

416
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,839
Three, issue with a fellow hunter?
You fight it out.

417
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,756
[grunts]

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,635
Four, no phones, no shirts. No exceptions.

419
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,679
Other than that,

420
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,098
no rules!

421
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,808
-Yeah!
-Grunt!

422
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,226
-[all grunting]
-Scream!

423
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,646
-[all screaming]
-Embrace your inner beasts!

424
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,022
[all shouting]

425
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,442
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

426
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,944
Yes!

427
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,949
Come on! Let's go, Goldberg!
I'm gonna get you dirty tonight, boy.

428
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,993
[Joe] Shit.

429
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:21,626
Love, you had your tribe in L.A.
You even found one here.

430
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,171
[all screaming]

431
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,301
But if this is my pack,
I think I'm meant to be a lone wolf.

432
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,802
You ready to feel like a high-speed,

433
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,805
low-drag apex motherfucking predator
out there?

434
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,311
Shit.

435
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,107
Thattaboy.

436
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,734
Now listen to that drum.

437
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,194
Huh?

438
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,571
How does it make you feel?

439
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,655
[Joe] Appropriative.

440
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:56,578
You've been disconnected for so long
that your manhood is literally shrinking.

441
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,373
Love told Sherry about your dick issues.

442
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,541
[Joe] You told her?

443
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,126
Come on.

444
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,836
Feel that.

445
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,631
You feel alive right now, don't you?

446
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,425
And you want more.

447
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,844
Tell me I'm wrong.

448
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,137
[Joe] He's wrong.

449
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,222
It's fine.

450
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,848
I do, yeah.

451
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:24,105
You're my charge tonight, Joe.
I'm not letting you leave my side.

452
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,073
Now we hunt.

453
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,743
I can't believe they said no presents.

454
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,746
At least I won't be paying
for his therapy.

455
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,830
[cell phone buzzing]

456
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,958
Got any more wine?

457
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,800
Hello?

458
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,427
Theo, I can't talk.

459
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,347
You're where?

460
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,891
[Cary] Keep up the pace, Goldberg.

461
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,063
I didn't give you permission to stop.
Beasts don't stop.

462
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,356
[ominous music playing]

463
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,692
Faster.

464
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,282
-Wait. Hang on. I need a second.
-Boo-hoo. Get up.

465
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,743
-I need a minute.
-There are no time-outs in life.

466
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,037
On your feet.

467
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,457
Jesus Christ.
Does your penis have mounds on it?

468
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,044
[Joe] No. I am not that guy,
as much as Cary deserves it.

469
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,337
-[branches rustling]
-Quiet.

470
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,172
-You hear that?
-What?

471
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,636
Oh, what the fuck now?

472
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,222
Wait here.

473
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,933
[Joe] Things aren't gonna work out
between me and Cary.

474
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,186
I'd say now is my chance to escape.

475
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,772
But if he doesn't come back, I'll starve,

476
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,358
or be eaten by whatever I'm hunting.

477
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,277
This is what I get for being a pacifist.

478
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,196
Woo-hoo!

479
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,741
-[Joe] Uh... No.
-Take it.

480
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,284
-Take the squirrel.
-No.

481
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,994
-Kill it.
-No, no, no.

482
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,956
Are you okay with your life as it is?
If you wanna get your dick up again--

483
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,293
-I don't see how the two are related.
-[yelling] It's about being a man!

484
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,628
Let go of the squirrel. You're hurting it.

485
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,546
[squirrel chittering]

[in normal voice]
Yeah. You think I'm a bully?

488
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:21,890
Fine.

489
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,225
You know the rules.

490

"You got a problem with a fellow hunter,

491
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,522
you fight it out."

492
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,653
Come on, Joe.
I'm gonna need you to hit me.

from this movie.

Come on, bro! Clock me, motherfucker!

00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,997
What you gonna do, Goldberg?

497
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,417
Fucking hit me!

[Derek] No one is coming to save you.
What you gonna do, Goldberg?

503
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,336
Don't!

504

-Help. Help.
-What happened?

505

-Cary...
-He fell.

[Jackson] Is he okay?

507

-He fell.
-Shit.

Hey! No phones.

509
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,112
Are you serious? This is an emergency.

510

-He's not breathing.
-Shit, there's no signal.

511

-He's dead.
-We don't know that.

What's going on? Oh, God.

513
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,371
We don't know that. He might not be.

Come on. Come on.

515
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,418
-Come on!
-What are we gonna do?

516
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,086
Come on, wake up.

517
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,254
Wake up.

518
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,673
What are you doing, Goldberg?

519
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,094
You saving me?

520
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,473
I'm fucking moved, man.

521
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,642
-Oh, my God. You're alive.
-Of course I'm alive.

522
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,688
Been taking glutathione for a decade.

523
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,773
[groans]

524
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,942
I'm impossible to kill.

525
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,030
-[shoulder cracks]
-[groans]

526
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,072
Ooh.

527
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,835
And this fucking guy...

528
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,213
[Joe] He's gonna tell them
I threw him off a fucking cliff,

529
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,008
that I'm crazy, whatever
the opposite is of "part of the tribe."

530
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,053
Goldberg is a fucking animal.

531
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,931
Come here.

532
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:24,072
You are one fine specimen of a man, Joe.

533
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,582
[breathing heavily]

534
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,379
Let it out.

535
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,466
[sobbing]

536
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,472
[Jackson] Yes, Joe. Let it out.
Good man. That's it. You got this.

537
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,391
[Brandon]
You got this. This is your 'Manjaro.

538
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,351
-[Jackson] There he is.
-[Andrew] You're good.

539
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,978
Welcome to the other side.

540
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,193
[Andrew] You got this. Yeah!

541
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,697
[Joe] I came to the woods,
afraid of the darkness inside me,

542
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,199
but they saw it

543
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,243
and accepted me anyway.

544
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,413
Is this what it feels like
to have friends?

545
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,416
Fitting in is not always the worst.

546
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,503
Yes, they're silly. Yes, what happens
out here is fucking nuts.

547
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,921
All I know...

548
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,508
is I feel like me again.

549
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,322
-I didn't think it would take so long.
-You could have killed yourself.

550
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,324
-Or someone else.
-That might be stretching it.

551
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,785
-You don't know that!
-I was driving a scooter.

552
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,289
An electric scooter.

553
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,668
Ah.

554
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,172
They arrested you
for driving drunk on a scooter?

555
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,089
Yeah.

556
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,641
You ever been on one?

557
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,185
[Love laughing]

558
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,853
-[Theo] All right. Ready?
-Yeah.

559
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,563
-Ready for the hill?
-Yeah.

560
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,773
We're charging the hill.

561
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,024
[both shouting]

562
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,613
Let's go!

563
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,617
Oh, fuck.

564
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,291
-Ow.
-See? It's not that easy.

565
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,376
Is it?

566
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,504
I can't believe
I've never done that before.

567
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,424
Well, you know, it is a perfectly
socially-acceptable way

568
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,885
for adults to get around now, FYI.

569
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,476
Um...

570
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,731
So the rumors about...

571
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,112
me taking a leave of absence
because of Natalie...

572
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,030
Um...

573
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,992
They're not true.

574
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,369
I...

575
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,164
I'm flunking out because...

576
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,419
I can't stop thinking about you.

577
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,889
If you want me to shut up, I will.
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

578
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,559
I'm just trying to figure out...

579
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,690
how I can focus when all I want is you.

580
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,650
Theo, shut up.

581
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,610
No.

582
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,988
It's like you're playing house.

583
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,575
But none of this actually makes you happy.

584
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,910
I'm playing house?

585
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,790
You're a teenager chasing
after a married woman.

586
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,584
What's your endgame?

587
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,135
[dramatic music playing]

588
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,279
[cell phone buzzing]

589
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you go to the bakery
for that frosting tip or Alaska?

590
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,294
I got distracted
with the sourdough starter.

591
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,838
I saw that boy get out of your car.

592
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,424
What are you doing?

593
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,470
It's nothing. I'm just helping him out.

594
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,307
You missed Henry's first steps.

595
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,726
What?

596
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,646
You might have seen
if you'd picked up when I FaceTimed you.

597
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,690
Oh, he's down for the night now.

598
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,028
Love, Love,

599
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,656
all parents make mistakes.

600
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,865
God knows I did.

601
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,909
I missed my son's first steps.

602
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,702
It was anticlimactic.

603
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,288
I don't even think
I really remember yours.

604
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,249
What the fuck am I even doing?

605
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,418
I mean, I'm happy here.

606
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,797
-Everything's fine if Joe would just be--
-Blame Joe all you want.

607
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,633
The truth is, you preferred him
when he was a problem to fix.

608
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,093
You like someone to save.

609
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,011
It's the dynamic you had
with your brother.

610
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,763
So let me be blunt. Grow up.

611
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,600
That boy will distract you from your son.

612
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,146
I know you love Henry,
but that doesn't mean you won't harm him.

613
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,986
Here, have some of my cab sauv.

614
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,489
Much healthier addiction than a teen boy.

615
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,911
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my crush Rachel Maddow is waiting.

616
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,333
[cell phone chimes]

617
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,120
This is very impressive.

618
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,166
Hey. Hi. Wow, you made it home on time.

619
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,793
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.

620
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,128
I'm...

621
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,756
I think
Henry's a little young for hunting.

622
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,549
These are gifts from Cary.

623
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,218
They're for us. His and hers.

624
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,344
Huh.

625
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,596
Wow.

626
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,474
Hey.

627
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,851
Hi, hi.

628
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,692
-Hey, you smell bad.
-Yeah, I know, it's awful.

629
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,571
I'm gonna shower,
but first, I need to apologize.

630
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,241
-No. Joe--
-I have been working so hard

631
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,618
to keep myself in line,

632
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,872
I forgot there are healthy ways
to let things out.

633
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,708
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about--

634
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,211
You don't need to tell me everything.

635
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,296
I trust you.

636
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,803
-Wow. That was some weekend you had.
-Yeah. Really, it was.

637
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,263
[doorbell rings]

638
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,806
Fuck, okay, okay.

639
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,725
-People are here. Get a shower real quick.
-Yeah.

640
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,643
Okay.

641
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,237
-[Love] Hi.
-[woman] Hi.

642
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,450
[Joe] I can't remember a time
when I didn't long for someone

643
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,619
who totally accepted me.

644
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,664
The bad with the good.

645
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:18,379
Why is it that a person who can do that
always comes at a cost?

646
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,469
Your friend Paulie's doing better.

647
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,389
Thought you might wanna know.

648
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,354
If you'd given it back to that bully,
I wouldn't have told on you.

649
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,607
It's what he deserves.

650
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,736
-I chickened out, I guess.
-Yeah.

651
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,531
'Cause you're not like him.

652
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,369
I know what it feels like
to get picked on.

653
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,665
I'm sorry, it's not fair.

654
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,756
We'll look out for each other.

655
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,175
Deal?

656
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,677
Deal.

657
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,063
[Joe] You were right, Love.
This party wasn't just about him.

658
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,523
We did it. We kept him safe.

659
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:24,278
Doesn't mean he'll happy all the time,
it just means we're here for him,

660
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,488
no matter what.

661
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,031
[both moaning]

662
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,080
Oh, my God.

663
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,332
Oh, my God.

664
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,834
You're an animal.

665
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,716
I think we're gonna have to get...

666
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,968
somebody to...

667
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,722
soundproof the bedroom.

668
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,933
-I think I know a guy.
-Mm-hm.

669
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,477
[cell phone beeping]

670
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,021
What?

671
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,148
-Fuck.
-What is it?

672
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,444
Fuck. The bakery. The alarm's been off
for, like, four hours.

673
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,654
It's probably okay.

674
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,533
-What if someone--?
-Look, I'm sure the sensor's

675
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,577
-just on the fritz, but I'll go. I got it.
-Yeah?

676
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,371
I really got it.

677
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,582
And by that,
I'm afraid what I really mean...

678
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,086
is that I used primitive tools
to carve out the time and space I need

679
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,797
to go on a certain kind of hunt.

680
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,972
I'll admit, this is all a bit elaborate.
And this ploy will only fool you once.

681
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,226
But after what happened with Natalie,
you can't blame me for covering my tracks.

682
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,856
[Theo] Oh, fuck.

683
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,233
Oh, my God.

684
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
[Theo moaning]

685
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,959
Oh, fuck.

686
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,045
[Joe] Cary actually taught me
an important lesson, Love.

687
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,256
I can't completely cage
what's inside of me

688
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,384
or, when it bursts out,
it comes for blood.

689
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,302

00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,513
Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,

691
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,391
keep it on a leash, take it out for walks,

692
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,810
but make sure it knows the rules.

693
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
No keepsakes.

694
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,105
Are you okay?

695
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,484
No social media, just watching.

696
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:32,114
So now I have you, Marienne.

697
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,202
Arms always full of books.
Never leaving the library before dark.

698
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,912
No one to hurry home to.

699
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,873
We're just friends.

700
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,709
So, what is it about you?

701
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,253
I can't pin it down.

702
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:51,759
All I know is that I've felt more alive
these past few days watching you

703
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,970
than I have in a long, long time,
Marienne.

704
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,850
But... you can trust me
with this secret, Love.

705
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,813
Juggling the two of you is confusing,
I'll admit.

706
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,566
But I'm up for the challenge.

707
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,068
You won't find out.

708
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,611
You can't.

709
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,322
I'll be careful. So, so careful.

710
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,033
Things will be different this time.

711
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,705
