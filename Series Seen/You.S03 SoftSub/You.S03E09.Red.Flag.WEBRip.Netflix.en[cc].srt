1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,477
[Joe] Previously on You:

2
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,521
[Love] Cary and Sherry
wanna sleep with us.

3
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,859
[Joe] Opening our marriage, this loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.

4
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,570
[Theo] You've been fucking buried in here.
Obsessed.

5
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,655
Just move on, okay? She's dead!

6
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,116
Get the fuck out now!

7
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,452
Just remember. Look at your partner.

8
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,329
[Joe] But I don't want Love.
I don't want any of this.

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,999
All I want is you.

10
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,168
-I killed Natalie for you!
-Shut up!

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,212
Go.

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,721
[Joe] Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.

13
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,516
How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?

14
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,158
You wanna give me a report?

15
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,327
I'm good, I'm good. Thanks, babe.

16
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,828
Okay, baby. Um...

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,123
I'm gonna have to move us
to a purple flag.

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,833
You're holding back.

19
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,710
Recognized.

20
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,465
I was in pain 'cause you got
some tape on my wound.

21
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,759
I didn't want it
to sound like I was blaming you.

22
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:37,055
Oh, my God. Baby, I appreciate
your concern for my feelings.

23
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,224
I'm moving us back to a green flag.

24
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,184
Stay in purple flag for a sec.

25
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
Yeah?

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,939
Try that bandage again
because it hurts like a motherfucker.

27
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,733
Yes, yeah, just brace yourself.

28
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,861
Breathe, sweetie. Take a deep breath in.

29
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,614
[Joe] I have some fucking weirdos
in the basement.

30
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,075
Yet, in their own weirdo way,

31
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,078
the Conrads bring out
the best in each other.

32
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:04,582
Now, Love and me,
we bring out something in each other.

33
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,210
[moans]

34
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,003
That's why I need to get out.

35
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,006
In Love's mind,
we're finally on the same page

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,886
and can face adversity as a united front,
which means Love's taken it upon herself

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,514
to figure out how to, quote,
"get rid of the Conrads."

38
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:24,310
And I am tasked with restoring our home
to a state of Rockwell perfection.

39
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,813
Rockwell by way of Bettie Page, anyway.

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,233
[Henry cooing]

41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,112
All while trying to keep
my son's attention on his cartoon.

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,495
Don't worry.

43
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166
After today, we're never doing this again.

44
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,973
[ominous music playing]

45
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,219
[Joe] Unread still.
Where are you, Marienne?

46
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,722
I need you to remind me
there's life beyond this.

47
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,515
What's wrong?

48
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,645
You throw your pacifier? Where is it?

49
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,317
R.I.P. pacifier.

50
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:59,447
And I have to figure out how to trash
Sherry and Cary's smorgasbord of sex toys.

51
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,284
Make it like this disaster of a night
never happened.

52
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,205
This stuff I should keep.

53
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,498
Could prove useful.

54
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,543
Unlike their lifetime supply
of double-headed dildos,

55
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,420
those I've seen enough of.

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,683
What the actual fuck?

57
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,185
So last night could have gone worse?

58
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,437
Fuck, this is a Chekhov situation now,
isn't it?

59
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,357
If I touch it,
I all but guarantee it gets fired.

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,067
Does that apply in real life?

61
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,070
There's a literary trope
that pops up as often as Chekhov's gun,

62
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:43,574
where you leave it
and then someone else uses it against you.

63
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,701
Of the two...

64
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,288
Chekhov was a logical man, he'd agree.

65
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,376
At least Henry can't comprehend
what's happening.

66
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,337
I'm trying to protect him, Marienne.

67
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,673
The way no one bothered to protect us.

68
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,508
[boys laughing]

69
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,725
-[boy 1] Check this out.
-[boy 2] Ooh!

70
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,811
[laughing, chattering]

71
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,317
Nurse Fiona?

72
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,819
Morning.

73
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,195
Morning, Joseph.

74
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,492
Are you okay?

75
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,370
Go hang out with your friends.

76
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,710
Who pissed in her Wheaties?

77
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,422
That guy she's dating hurts her.

78
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,467
What are you gonna do about it?
Gonna beat him up?

79
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,182
Come on, man. Didn't you learn
from last time with your mom?

80
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,154
[phone buzzing]

81
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,658
-Dante, what's up?
-[Dante] Have you seen Marienne?

82
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,243
I'm having trouble reaching her.

83
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,703
She didn't come into work?

84
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,539
I'm worried she got bad news
about the custody hearing.

85
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,166
-Shit.
-I hope not.

86
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,126
But, if so,

87
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,754
I might know where she went.

88
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,007
Tell me where. I can go.

89
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,634
Okay, there's this store.

90
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,303
When she was feeling really bad,
she used to sit outside

91
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,180
and entertain going in.

92
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,640
She hasn't done it in a while.

93
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,225
-A liquor store?
-If she's there,

94
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,727
she's not gonna wanna talk to you.

95
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,356
[Joe] I should have been with you,
not in Love's latest mess.

96
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,941
I shouldn't have left you alone.

97
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,820
Hey, Dante, can you watch Henry
for just a little bit?

98
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,321
Oh, my God. Yes.

99
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,199
-Bring the little prince here.
-Thank you. I'll be there soon.

100
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,455
Love thinks I'm getting rid of evidence.
Ought to buy me some time.

101
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,126
I'm coming, Marienne.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

102
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,221
These look amazing.

103
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,389
Thank you.

104
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,978
What's up with him?

105
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,814
Mm, stomach problems, stress.

106
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,233
But honestly, I think these will help.

107
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,192
Cary?

108
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,410
Thank you, Love.

109
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,829
You're both acting fucking weird.

110
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,872
I mean...

111
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,375
can you blame us?

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,211
And what about you? You--

113
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,797
Holding up all right?

114
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,842
Me?

115
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,759
Yeah.

116
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,723
I'm sure you'd rather spend
every spare minute on your letter.

117
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,642
For Henry's school counselor?

118
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,686
Fuck, that was due today.

119
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,522
I did say I'd help.
If you're comfortable with it.

120
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,860
It's super vital to have her on your side
if you wanna get into Ashman.

121
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,197
I'm not gonna let you write a letter
to help get my son into preschool.

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,114
No!

123
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,951
Love, see,
you're getting it wrong already.

124
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,621
It's not the admission letter.

125
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,998
It's a letter of introduction

126
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,543
for the counselor who's gonna get
your son into preschool.

127
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,003
Hey, truth?

128
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,380
One mother to another.

129
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,010
In no universe would I ever jeopardize
that baby's future.

130
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,431
And trust me,
you only get one shot at Ashman.

131
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,576
So Matthew has video of Joe and me?

132
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,913
I always thought
your husband was an abusive dick but...

133
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,792
now, thanks to my dad, there's proof.

134
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,461
So this is what he's been doing?
Recording people?

135
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,506
He's trying to figure out
who killed Natalie.

136
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,715
Does he think it was me?

137
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,134
What? No. No, of course not.

138
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,428
I mean, I don't know. I don't know.

139
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,223
Who knows what he thinks?
He's not on his A-game.

140
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,642
He's not recording people.

141
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,770
He's just-- He's accessing all the footage

142
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,481
from all the cameras
everyone's already got.

143
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,650
-What the fuck?
-Okay, okay, look.

144
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,652
He kicked me out.

145
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,279
Theo...

146
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,698
I'm not going back to my fucking mom's.

147
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,615
I just--

148
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,202
I'm gonna go do my own thing.

149
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,915
You know, go have a life, and, um...

150
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,420
I want you to come with me.

151
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,381
Run away with me, Love.

152
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,217
I care about you, like so--

153
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,721
I love you.

154
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,181
I can't stand it.

155
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,436
Just look me in the eye...

156
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,398
and tell me
that your husband is not a violent man.

157
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,236
Okay.

158
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,155
This is what I'm gonna do.

159
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,072
I'm gonna go,

160
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm gonna go back to my dad's
and get that footage.

161
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,037
It's gonna be hard proof
that Joe is a piece of shit.

162
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,955
I know that it's not admissible

163
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,333
and I know it would get my dad
in a lot of trouble,

164
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,627
but I am saying threaten Joe with it.

165
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,255
You can use it to make a clean break.

166
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,425
I know.

167
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,926
I know, it's a lot.

168
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,345
I need to think.

169
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,805
I'm gonna take care of you.

170
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,058
I promise.

171
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,976
Okay?

172
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,521
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

173
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,939
I'll be back.

174
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,775
Okay.

175
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,411
Fuck you, Dad.

176
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,674
[Joe] This is so far beneath you.

177
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:19,011
I wanna erase everything that ever
made you think you deserve to be here.

178
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,433
Um, what are you doing here?

179
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,061
Oh, shit. My book club meets here.

180
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,979
-What are you--?
-Dante.

181
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,274
We were worried.

182
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,905
-What happened?
-Please don't talk to me

183
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,033
in that tone of voice like I'm about
to jump off a goddamn building.

184
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,912
Have you?

185
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,751
Sometimes I just like to sit
and count the creases in the paper bag.

186
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,839
[Joe] You're embarrassed.
You don't want me to see you like this.

187
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,105
Did the judge rule against you?

188
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,400
Are you surprised?

189
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,820
Ryan's taking her away from me.

190
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,406
-You can fight it--
-They're moving to New Jersey.

191
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,370
He's got a new job lined up,
a huge opportunity,

192
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,830
cable news and...

193
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,500
could it be any more perfect than that?

194
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,294
[Joe] Son of a bitch.

195
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,881
I was so stupid
to take this back to court.

196
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,759
-I got greedy.
-You deserve everything you want.

197
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,469
And more.

198
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,513
Yeah.

199
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,307
You can tell Dante I'm fine.

200
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,726
Look.

201
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,227
Fine.

202
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,979
You can go.

203
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,940
I get it.

204
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,991
There are times I hate myself... too.

205
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,578
So much I can barely stand it.

206
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,794
I killed someone.

207
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,549
When I was little.

208
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,970
He was hurting my mom, so I shot him.

209
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,432
That's how I ended up in a home.

210
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,436
So you aren't the only person

211
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,231
who's haunted by shame.

212
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,484
Joe.

213
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,779
Do you think now that I deserve
all the bad things that happened to me?

214
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,489
No, of course not.

215
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,909
-You were a kid.
-My mom felt differently.

216
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,410
Yeah, well, fuck her.

217
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,454
She was your mom. I would never--

218
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,832
Exactly.

219
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,501
You would never.

220
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,920
That is the kind of mother you are.

221
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,090
I struggle...

222
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,219
every day with the fact that I'm capable
of doing something like that.

223
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,263
I hate that I did it, but I did it.

224
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,058
And I have to figure out
how I'm gonna live with it.

225
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,731
And Henry makes it worth it.

226
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,776
-Yes.
-Mm.

227
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,697
-Yes, and I did not see that coming.
-Mm-hm.

228
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,366
Yeah, neither did I.

229
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,703
I just want her back.

230
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,047
You're gonna figure that out.

231
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,719
That's what people like us do.

232
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,148
I don't need to cause any more damage.

233
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,317
You can't.

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm serious. No matter
how broken my marriage is,

235
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,988
it has nothing to do with you.

236
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,489
It's done.

237
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,451
I'm ending it.

238
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,413
I would do anything for you.

239
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,000
It's just, ask. Just ask me.

240
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,050
What am I supposed to do now?

241
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,678
What do you want?

242
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,980
[Joe] This.

243
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
This is real.

244
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,526
I don't have to pretend with you.

245
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,863
I'm the real me. This is our beginning.

246
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,326
I'll find a way to fix everything,
so that this is our every day.

247
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,870
[phone buzzing]

248
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,670
[phone chimes]

249
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,634
[vocalizing]

250
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,938
Cary, you're off-key.

251
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,399
You're not gonna get
the parasympathetic response.

252
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,734
I'm not looking to reduce heart rate.

253
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm seeking a state of readiness.

254
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,738
What?

255
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,448
You're gonna break us out of here?

256
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,284
I'm sensing a little bit of a tone.

257
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,621
Well, I'm in a cage and you're planking.

258
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,712
Do you have a plan?

259
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,384
Yes, use everything
that's at our disposal.

260
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,803
-My brute strength--
-Our relationships.

261
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,513
Your friendship with Love?

262
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,764
If you two were friends,

263
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,059
why didn't she tell you about
the dungeon in her basement?

264
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,144
[door opens]

265
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,022
-Hi, Love.
-Hey.

266
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,360
Okay, you could have asked.

267
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,740
Since you're in my phone,

268
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,368
I send my twins a check-in e-mail
every day that they're at camp.

269
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,412
Yeah, sure. I'll send one.

270
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,247
Thank you so much.

271
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:29,798
So, um...
why did you wanna get into my phone?

272
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,925
Just thought
I should make sure you check in

273
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,594
with your adoring masses.

274
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,514
You're gonna be off the grid
learning how to make placenta tea,

275
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,516
so no posts for a while.

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,727
God, you're so smart, Love.

277
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,313
-Even under stress and--
-Stop trying to be my friend.

278
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,732
We are friends.

279
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,153
Were, are... I'm sorry.
I don't know how to talk to you

280
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,947
-in this situation.
-Then why are you talking to me?

281
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,866
Because my life is at stake.

282
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,122
And, also, I happen to care about you
and apparently that didn't go away.

283
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,834
Kind of always knew you had secrets.

284
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,214
I just thought
I knew why you were so hush-hush.

285
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,675
Because Madre Linda is a nest
full of narcissistic vipers?

286
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,386
I mean, yeah, of course.

287
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,139
'Cause narcissism is control.

288
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,476
Do you know how terrifying it is
to not feel like you're in control?

289
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,604
Especially with a kid.

290
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:31,235
And... who isn't trying
to control us, Love?

291
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,072
We're two women who are smarter
than everyone else

292
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,491
and people can't stand that.

293
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:45,916
I mean, my influencer bullshit means
I get to choose my flaws.

294
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,128
What gets criticized, when they even see.

295
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,172
It's how I protect myself and my family.

296
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,508
Look where that got you.

297
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,929
[laughing]

298
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,766
Yeah.

299
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,852
I guess one could argue,

300
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,521
I was in a cage of my own making
the moment I had kids.

301
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,067
No, got married.

302
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:18,157
And at some point,
it all feels like the game is rigged.

303
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,161
This was all and-- Hilariously inevitable.

304
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,426
Theo tried to convince me
to run away with him.

305
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,053
You're shitting me!

306
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,432
He's totally in love with you,
and I knew it.

307
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,558
[Sherry laughs]

308
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,897
I mean, it's, like, super gross
but I think that's kind of hot.

309
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,107
[both laughing]

310
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,984
-Ew.
-Shh.

311
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,409
He also told me that Matthew

312
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:07,497
has been stealing surveillance footage,
hoping to find out who killed Natalie.

313
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,001
He won't find anything.

314
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,755
You should out him.

315
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,299
-What?
-What do you mean?

316
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,511
On my blog. Yeah, you should say
that we found out that Matthew

317
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,764
has been watching us. He's a creep.

318
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
Out him.

319
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,894
Just my opinion.

320
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,778
[Joe] I thought I knew what love was.

321
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,239
Beck was a child.

322
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:44,284
And Love? She fooled me into believing
she was someone she wasn't.

323
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,829
The only thing I'm thankful for,
she brought our son into the world

324
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,290
and led me to you.

325
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,293
It's you, Marienne.

326
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,588
[phone buzzing]

327
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,135
Oh, no.

328
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,440
[Love on voicemail]
Joe, Theo got information.

329
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,192
Just call me back as soon as you get this.

330
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,153
[Joe] I left her to her own devices
for too long.

331
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,906
God knows what she--
The Conrads are probably dead.

332
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,701
Maybe she burned their house down,
then bashed Matthew over the head.

333
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,619
Goddamn it, Love.

334
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,038
Who's that, Joe?

335
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,591
Joe...

336
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,638
Thank you.

337
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,892
You were right.
I can't just give up on Juliette again.

338
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,396
I can't let her feel
that her mother could ever abandon her.

339
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,024
So I'm leaving Madre Linda.

340
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,735
You're leaving?

341
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,196
Follow them to New Jersey,
even if it means sleeping in my car,

342
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,407
flipping burgers, whatever it takes.

343
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,992
[Joe] I'm going to lose you.

344
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,626
I don't regret this.

345
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
[Joe] Good, good.

346
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,674
But how can I stop this
from being the end for us?

347
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,847
Go home, Joe.

348
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,727
Can I at least get my clothes back?

349
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,064
I guess that seems fair.

350
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,945
[Joe] This wasn't the plan,
but I can't blame you.

351
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,656
You're trying to solve
an impossible problem,

352
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,743
and that problem is Ryan.

353
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,621
[Travis] Why don't you just sleep
in your office? I don't care.

354
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,747
[Fiona] Travis!

355
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,847
What did you do?

356
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,157
[Joe] Chekhov, you fucker. I can't, right?

357
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,326
That's the guy Love wants me to be.

358
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,164
Then again, people like us,
we figure it out.

359
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,458
Ryan has to die.

360
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,386
[Joe] Is that our doorbell cam?

361
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,514
Yeah, ripped it out. Where's Henry?

362
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,977
He's with Dante. I wasn't clear
on when our guests are checking out.

363
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,812
Yeah, I've been preoccupied.

364
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:03,608
So, turns out,
our friendly neighbor has been hacking

365
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,944
into everyone's security cameras
for months.

366
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,571
-[Joe] Shit.
-Yeah.

367
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,407
He thinks
his wife's killer is still out there.

368
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,491
Oh, does he?

369
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:17,956
Yeah, but thank God
for Sherry Conrad who found out

370
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,543
and took it upon herself
to blog about it a half hour ago.

371
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,005
[Joe]
It must be said, Love's good at all this.

372
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,590
Say more, please.

373
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,802
It seems like she found out
what he was doing,

374
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:35,724
so she and Cary fled
to some undisclosed location.

375
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,143
Whole town's in an uproar.

376
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,603
[Joe] Scary good.

377
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,648
Which explains a whole slew of suits
that just descended on the Engler house.

378
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,110
My best guess, it's a bunch
of lawyers scrambling to cover up

379
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,446
all the insanely illegal shit
he's been doing.

380
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,489
Wow.

381
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,532
You really have been busy.

382
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:59,873
Yeah. Well, as were you, it seems.

383
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,043
[Joe] Shit. The other shoe drops.

384
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,712
The house looks amazing.

385
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,924
Good as new, right?

386
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,552
Quite the team, aren't we?

387
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,554
[Joe] In the worst way.

388
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,728
Fuck.

389
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,484
-What--? What is this?
-[Joe] Anton cackling in his grave.

390
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,111
I found that in Cary's stuff.

391
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,446
-Cary?
-Yeah.

392
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,157
That psycho brought a gun into our house?

393
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,494
These people are more fucked up
than I thought.

394
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,663
Um, okay.

395
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,168
Perfect. We could make it look
like a murder-suicide.

396
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,128
Worked for us before.

397
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,677
[Joe] Listen to her. Our marriage
cannot end soon enough.

398
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,220
Great minds...

399
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,932
[Matthew] Okay.

400
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,685
You want me to wipe it? I hear you.

401
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,062
You're not hearing me
because I'm not saying that.

402
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,605
We need to be clear.

403
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:10,485
You're erasing everything you've gathered
of your own volition and entirely alone.

404
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,529
[Matthew]
And throwing the whole thing away

405
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,782
because, damn it,
I just felt like an upgrade. Got it.

406
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:24,958
Hey, I'm sorry,
I was just coming to look for my charger.

407
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,646
If I could just get
a little more time here, please.

408
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,070
Show me the thing that's haunting you.

409
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,781
If there's more,
I will do everything I can to help.

410
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,408
I don't trust my neighbors.

411
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,119
-Joe seems okay, but the wife, Love.
-The Quinn, of course.

412
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:05,165
Yes, Love saw Natalie
the day she disappeared, and she is off.

413
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,875
Okay. Okay, let's see it.

414
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,797
Nat arrives, then she goes in...

415
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,930
Then drives away. What am I missing?

416
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,391
She stayed in there for a while,
then she comes out.

417
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,018
There's a second missing,

418
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,229
and she's wearing
that coat and hat, and...

419
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,358
Keep going.
Do you think that's not Natalie?

420
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,151
I know how it sounds.

421
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,237
Okay, it's not her.
It's the Quinn who killed her,

422
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,158
broke her ring to destroy the bio-data,
staged it at a rest stop,

423
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,036
dropped off her car,
and killed Gil Brigham too,

424
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,245
of all people.

425
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,414
Made it look like a suicide
to frame him for murder.

426
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,583
-I am trying--
-I know what it sounds like.

427
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:54,798
Or Natalie was a beautiful,
flawed person with secrets.

428
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,384
Part of her wasn't
who you thought she was.

429
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,638
I don't fucking believe that, okay?
I can't fucking believe that.

430
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,310
I just keep thinking.
If I look harder, I'm gonna see it.

431
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:11,189
Okay, you have combed
through this thoroughly. Am I wrong?

432
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,109
You have to decide if you're gonna
let this hunch destroy you,

433
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,277
your company, this family.

434
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,031
These people are coming for you.
It needs to be gone.

435
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,153
You did the right thing.

436
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,758
So... I haven't seen Joe much.

437
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,260
Can you...?

438
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,512
I'll get him a new one.

439
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,055
Yeah.

440
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,559
God. You know, it doesn't seem fair.

441
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,189
This all. I mean, Joe's the reason
we're all in this position

442
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,523
in the first place.

443
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,028
You didn't do what you did to Natalie

444
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,739
because the Englers were stealing
your Wi-Fi.

445
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,290
You were trying to tell me
how disconnected you felt.

446
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,709
Of course.

447
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,506
Your husband's
screwing someone else while you're what,

448
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,965
changing diapers?

449
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,676
Sherry, shut the fuck up.

450
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,846
Where is he now?

451
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:12,185
Fuck him. Letting you fix a marriage that
never stood a chance in the first place.

452
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,363
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

453
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,573
-Easy, hon!
-Is that my nine?

454
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,200
Just sit and be quiet.

455
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,330
New rules. One of you takes this,
shoots the other.

456
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,167
I let whoever lives out.

457
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,546
-Are you insane?
-Wait, what?

458
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:45,260
Well, if your marriage is so perfect,
stay together, die together.

459
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,056
[door opens]

460
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,767
[door closes, then locks]

461
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,520
[dramatic music playing]

462
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,470
[Joe] This is the part of myself
I told you I struggle against.

463
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,891
It took bros in the woods to teach me
it's not something I need to reject.

464
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,101
It can be embraced for the right reasons.

465
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,479
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

466
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,150
[Joe] He looks like a man riding high
on a string of recent victories.

467
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,860
Big new job, full custody of his kid.

468
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,988
Thanks to Cary Conrad's
black-market elephant tranquilizer,

469
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,326
Ryan's tox report will tell the story,
a guy trying to outrun the demons.

470
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,578
Sadly, the demons won.

471
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,463
I know from my recon
that Ryan is the kind of nutjob

472
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,215
who thinks taking the stairs
will add years to his life.

473
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,176
Well, the irony.

474
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,346
Wait, where's he going?

475
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,432
[elevator bell dings]

476
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,438
The elevator, you lazy piece of shit.

477
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,424
You following me, asshole? Huh?

478
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:49,968
[Joe] Fuck.

479
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,849
You gotta be kidding me.
My ex put you up to this, Library Joe?

480
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,977
-No, that was me.
-No? All right.

481
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,022
-Speak up. I can't hear you.
-I just want to talk.

482
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,441
Talk, really? Talk.

483
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,318
With this?

484
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,947
[Joe] New trope:
wishing you had Chekhov's gun to fire.

485
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,241
I think I'll call the cops.

486
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,244
Great. I'll tell them
about the drugs in your car.

487
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,713
You tell that bitch,
she's lucky I didn't kill you.

488
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,214
You got it?

489
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,148
[thuds]

490
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,150
[Joe] Simple overdose is out,

491
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,069
but he was wasted,
stepped too close to the edge,

492
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,571
even took a tragic leap.

493
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,324
It all works, so long as this bastard's--

494
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,952
Alive?

495
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,870
[groans]

496
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,415
[grunting]

497
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,588
One person cuts out before Shavasana,
I'm doing 20-to-life.

498
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,721
You don't have it in you.

499
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,433
[dramatic music playing]

500
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,400
[Ryan gasps]

501
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,486
That's for her.

502
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,200
Robbery-homicide may have to do.

503
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,006
[woman] Oh, my God. Help!

504
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,927
-[Joe] Always stay through Shavasana.
-[woman] Help! Somebody call 911!

505
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,804
What are you doing back there?

506
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,533
What the fuck?

507
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,421
Holy shit.

508
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,058
[Love on voicemail] Hey.
You've reached Love Quinn-Goldberg.

509
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,811
Please leave me a message
and I'll get back to you soon as I can.

510
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,523
Love, hi, it's me. Where are you?
We need to talk right now.

511
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,819
There's no saying this is bulletproof.

512
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:43,910
Do you really think she would have
given us a gun if it wasn't?

513
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,246
God, will you just finish already? Oh!

514
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,916
Babe, I am trying.

515
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,754
I don't know how you're so regular
without any soluble fiber.

516
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:00,092
You know what, Sher,
it's like you think we're on a train.

517
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,555
We'll reach our stop,
the door will magically open.

518
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,100
Right. 'Cause I'm not crawling
up the walls like a moron.

519
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,518
Oh, yeah.

520
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:14,565
'Cause your plan, unlike my shit,
is proving to be real fucking solid.

521
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,820
Hello?

522
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:23,866
Love?

523
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,952
You here?

524
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,292
Love?

525
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,183
Love?

526
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,281
You know,

527
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,660
we need to start thinking about the kids.

528
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,623
We really need to consider their future.

529
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,714
That's not just an argument
for me to be the one to get out.

530
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,215
Wait...

531
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:26,512
Why would thinking about what's best
for the kids be an argument for you?

532
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,058
Name Cole's geo tutor.

533
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,604
Monica.

534
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,233
Monica's math.

535
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,363
Who the fuck has
a geo tutor, Cary? No one!

536
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,364
You know what?

537
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,285
We're not gonna fucking debate
which parent gets to live!

538
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,914
Fuck this.

539
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,542
-What are you doing?
-Stand back!

540
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,436
Man, guy told me this would go
through an engine block.

541
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,150
[sobbing] You shot...

542
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,987
my ear.

543
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,364
Oh, my God.

544
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,325
Shit, shit. Let me--

545
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,244
-Just let me see.
-Stay away from me.

546
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,288
-I know head trauma.
-Stop.

547
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,916
[yelling] Get
the hell away from me, honey!

548
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,833
Hey!

549
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,669
Hey.

550
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,184
[Sherry] They're murderers, Theo!

551
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,521
We think they killed Gil too.
They blamed it all on him.

552
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,648
Wait. Where's Love?

553
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,651
-What do you mean, "Where's Love?"
-Theo, she's half of it!

554
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,985
Don't be an idiot!

555
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,656
She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her.

556
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,660
Now she's delivering a letter to
a preschool counselor half an hour away.

557
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,287
Like she doesn't have two people
locked in her basement.

558
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,997
She'll be back any minute.

559
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,168
I am not exactly in a position
to lie to you right now, am I?

560
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,130
-Get us out of here, Theo.
-No. You don't know her situation.

561
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,174
-Joe is the one that killed Natalie.
-Joe didn't fucking kill her!

562
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,219
Let us out! Now! Find the key!

563
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,804
Let us out!

564
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,182
[Joe] You'll never believe that he's dead.

565
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,560
Not just because people like Ryan
never seem to die

566
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:43,190
but because he taught you that you don't
deserve a second chance, but you do.

567
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,276
We both do.

568
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,660
I don't feel bad about this.

569
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:59,540
It isn't like what Love does.
She is crazy, impulsive.

570
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,793
But real evil has to be dealt with

571
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,006
and you don't do that by letting it live
to take good people down.

572
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,645
Hey, it's Fiona.

573
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,773
Something happened.

574
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,219
[phone buzzes]

575
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,559
[Dante on voice recording]
Hey. Wondering if I should put Henry down.

576
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,896
I'm not sure when Joe's coming.
Let me know. No presh.

577
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,813
What?

578
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,567
[clearing throat]

579
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:14,240
Hey, Dante.
Yeah, thank you so much for taking him.

580
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:19,286
Let me double-check with Joe. If I can't
reach him, I'll call you in a sec.

581
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,996
Thank you.

582
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,290
[voice recording sends]

583
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,592
[door opens]

584
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,888
Oh, fuck. You scared me.

585
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,725
What are you doing?

586
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,063
Uh, nothing, nothing.

587
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,359
Um...

588
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,569
Is that a key?

589
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,704
I know that it's not true.

590
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,583
What the Conrads said that you did.

591
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,094
What did the Conrads say I did?

592
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,804
That you killed Natalie.

593
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:27,104
I found footage from the day
that she disappeared.

594
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,773
It was Joe.

595
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,739
I know what he is.
You don't have to protect him anymore.

596
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,285
I need you to leave.

597
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,457
I need you to leave Madre Linda
and never come back.

598
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,666
Come with me, then.

599
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,838
I can't.

600
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,300
It's my family.

601
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,977
We can never...

602
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,397
see each other...

603
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,484
ever again.

604
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,158
You have to promise me.

605
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:28,499
Theo, I need you to promise me.

606
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,461
Okay.

607
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,215
I promise.

608
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,511
Whatever you want.

609
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,807
Okay.

610
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,144
Okay, you need to go. Now.

611
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,191
I need you to give me the key back.

612
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,487
Um...

613
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,159
-What about...? What are you...?
-No. Don't worry.

614
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,122
I'm gonna let them out,
the second you leave.

615
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,459
Of course.

616
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,797
Okay.

617
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,175
I'm gonna go.

618
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,014
Goodbye, Love.

619
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,397
Theo, wait.

620
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,532
[gasping]

621
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,423
[theme music playing]
