1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,811
[Joe] Previously on You:

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,979
I still believe...

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,023
-You okay there, Joe?
-...in The One.

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,776
I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,237
[Marienne] Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,822
Now he's threatening me.

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,948
Stay away from her.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,702
[Joe] As long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,749
How much do you know
about Love's first husband?

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,753
Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

11
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,380
[Theo]
And you've been buried in here, obsessed!

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,466
Just move on, okay? She's dead!

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,593
Get the fuck out now!

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,095
Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,514
-I killed Natalie for you!
-Shut up.

16
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,724
Go.

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,481
Fuck this.

18
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,525
-[Sherry] What are you doing?
-Stand back!

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,196
You just shot my ear.

20
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,951
She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her!

21
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,828
Get us out of here, Theo.

22
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,633
[Joe] Shirley Jackson wrote

23
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,595
that suburbia
is where people start to come apart.

24
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,766
I thought I'd escape before
that happened to me, but if I'd done that,

25
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,435
I'd never have met you.

26
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,814
I'm not free...

27
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,941
unless we both are, Marienne.

28
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,986
So I had to. You deserve a man
who does what has to be done.

29
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,493
Right now, I have to save my son
from his mother.

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,415
Mr. Mooney used to say
there's a monster inside every boy,

31
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,584
all too easy to feed.

32
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,296
If you make it strong, it will take over.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,465
We can save Henry together.

34
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,260
I just need to get us out

35
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,680
before Love feeds Henry so much
as another bite.

36
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,813
They're saying she moved to Ohio.

37
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,316
Yeah, sure. She left her plants
and the picture of her mom.

38
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,111
It was her boyfriend.

39
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,197
-No. Or maybe she ran away.
-I could've stopped him.

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,119
-The last time it ruined my entire life.
-You mean, like, with your mom...?

41
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,413
It made her hate me so much,
she put me here.

42
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,542
So I thought, with Fiona,
I didn't want her to hate me.

43
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,296
For the record, you don't know
how your mom feels. You're making it up.

44
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,174
Hey, trust me, I do it too.

45
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,178
But I'll never actually know
why mine left me here.

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,389
Neither will you.

47
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,061
[suspenseful music playing]

48
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,471
[phone buzzing]

49
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,683
[door unlocks, then opens]

50
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,810
-[Love] Joe?
-[door closes]

51
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,728
I'm home.

52
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,315
[Joe] Fuck. If she sees blood, it's over.

53
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,609
Joe?

54
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,032
What are you doing in here?

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,576
Looking for a charger. That's the one.

56
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,000
[groans] What a fucking day.

57
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,295
We need to figure out
how we're gonna endgame the Conrads.

58
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,756
-Brainstorm...
-[Joe] Something is up with her.

59
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,050
Also, we need to have an alibi.

60
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,595
-So I did get an Airbnb in Mill Valley.
-[Joe] She's barely looking at me.

61
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,765
Sherry and Cary aren't enough
to throw her this off-balance.

62
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,850
And the bakery, I have an order.

63
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,437
It's a big one, so that'll be good
to keep everything open.

64
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,398
And I had a thought about us.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,275
Is this...

66
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,027
Conrad blood?

67
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,409
-No, that's Theo. He came by the bakery.
-[Joe] Oh, no.

68
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,035
I, uh... He--

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,955
Um, I had to...

70
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,999
[Joe] That's what she can't look at.

71
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,417
Poor Theo.

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,461
He's still there, in the basement.

73
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,632
[Joe] Fuck. Okay, problem or opportunity?

74
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,260
I'll handle him.
Don't give it another thought.

75
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,303
My epiphany.

76
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,513
I was just thinking,

77
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,475
like, we're gonna be through this
so soon, right?

78
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,601
[Joe] I hope.

79
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,728
-Right?
-Yeah.

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,065
I just think it's perfect, so--
To really fucking start a new chapter.

81
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,736
It's time for us
to try for another baby, Joe.

82
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,362
[Joe] I'm...

83
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
actually speechless.

84
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,371
I want nothing more in the world, Love.

85
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,499
Yeah, let's do it.

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,133
Too bad, tomorrow,
Henry and I will be gone.

87
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:46,054
Of course, this all hinges
on the only question that matters.

88
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,307
When I go...

89
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,310
will you come with me?

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,918
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,047
Theo, hi, it's me.
Can you call me and check in, please?

92
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,054
I was too harsh when I kicked you out...

93
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
but you don't have to--

94
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,020
-[door opens]
-Just let me know you're okay, please.

95
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,072
[Joe] You poor, dumb kid.

96
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,949
I'm so sorry.

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,501
-Come on, man.
-He's not coming back.

98
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,212
It's been hours.

99
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,714
Hey, let me see that.

100
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,009
No.

101
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,222
Sher, I took a survival medicine seminar
with a dude who won Season 6 of Alone.

102
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,434
I can't hear you...

103
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,645
because you shot me in the ear.

104
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,855
It ricocheted.

105
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,566
Tell that to the part of my ear
plastered to that bucket.

106
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,153
-Red flag, okay? This is my turn.
-No. No more techniques.

107
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,864
[Joe] Love's right.
They are gonna argue to death.

108
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,866
Marriage brings out the worst in us all.

109
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,369
-That's not fair. Just let me--
-Don't! You've done enough.

110
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,415
-You're... You're hysterical.
-Fuck you! That is sexist as shit!

111
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,500
I am a feminist...

112
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,586
who grazed you!

113
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,797
Oh, you wanna know
what grazing feels like?

114
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
-Hey, hey!
-Don't get hysterical.

115
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,594
-I took a seminar.
-Hey, hey!

116
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,764
[Joe] Oh, fuck. I'm gonna need more tarps.

117
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,601
No! [groans]

118
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,394
Oh, my God.

119
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,231
-Cary?
-You didn't graze me.

120
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,067
You fucking...

121
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,905
shot me in the leg.

122
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,077
[phone buzzing]

123
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,835
-Hey, I've been trying to reach you.
-[Marienne] Um, Joe...

124
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,005
Ryan's dead.

125
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,174
-What?
-Mugging, apparently.

126
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,635
Been a few in the area. Guy with a knife.

127
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:35,264
Seems like this just went really bad,
but the police still interrogated me.

128
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,226
I feel like this is gonna blow back on me.

129
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,978
-I just know it.
-This was part of a string of muggings?

130
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,481
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.

131
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:48,027
-Weren't you with Juliette last night?
-Yes, I was. I have an alibi, but...

132
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,906
I also have a very long history
of being fucked by the system.

133
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,116
A system that was made by and for Ryan.

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,743
Can I disagree?

135
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,246
Not about the system
but just about this moment.

136
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,543
I'd love to be wrong.

137
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,671
Listen, the man who hurt you,

138
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,716
who wanted to steal your child...

139
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,428
he is now gone forever.

140
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,723
You shouldn't send the mugger flowers,

141
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,643
but I am saying
this is your life getting easier.

142
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,189
-Promise not to judge?
-No, never.

143
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,858
I'm glad he's dead.

144
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,117
Can I tell you something else
that happened last night?

145
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,954
Love and I are officially separating.

146
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,582
Wait, seriously?

147
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,044
But, like, no, I'm-- I'm so--
I'm so sorry.

148
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:47,962
Don't be.

149
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,340
We're both gonna be free... very soon.

150
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,804
Why don't you get out of town
while this Ryan drama dies down?

151
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,600
-Yeah, we should.
-Just think of some place you wanna go.

152
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,560
Anywhere. And just go.

153
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,521
Hey, Joe.

154
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
Come with us.

155
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,325
I know, I know, that's crazy.

156
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,035
No, it's not, it's not.

157
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,289
You've been such a rock,
and I let myself fantasize about a...

158
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,418
About a simple, happy, healthy family
for a second, and when I...

159
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,589
When I picture that, I picture you.
And Henry, of course.

160
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,883
And I know you said you love me,

161
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,677
but it was in a certain moment,
I get that,

162
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,263
but I realized, I actually, um...

163
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,351
I love you.

164
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,353
I love you, and...

165
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,230
Yeah, so that.

166
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,695
That's probably way too much, too soon.

167
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,655
No.

168
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,947
Marienne.

169
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,949
Yes!

170
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,993
Yes. Count us in.

171
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,206
We'd be crazy not to try after everything
we've been through to get here, right?

172
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,667
We just have to tie up a few loose ends.

173
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,503
I can't believe we're doing this.

174
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,881
I can. It's fate.

175
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,009
Mm. Gotta go.

176
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,138
Bunch of songbirds just landed on me
and I think we're going flying.

177
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,224
[both laughing]

178
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,019
I'll see you in the sky.

179
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,824
You invited me, we have a future.

180
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,995
This will be the last ugly thing
I ever have to do.

181
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,833
[Theo groaning]

182
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,295
Come on.

183
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,219
Love couldn't even finish the job.
So much for a clean break.

184
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,722
The kid knows everything. If he talks...

185
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,975
[groaning]

186
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,147
Finish it. No one would know.

187
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,773
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,068
I'm so, so sorry.

189
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,111
[Joe] I would know.

190
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,030
Didn't I just promise the love of my life

191
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,117
a happy, healthy, new beginning?

192
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,038
I will never...

193
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,459
touch her again.

194
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,879
You think
this is because you kissed my wife?

195
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,172
It was once.

196
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh, you fucked my wife?

197
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,304
What a mess my wife has made.

198
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,557
I loved her.

199
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,979
Why did she do this?

200
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,066
This is not your fault. She fooled me too.

201
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,402
Are you gonna...

202
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,154
kill me?

203
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,785
[Theo groaning]

204
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,629
[Joe] There is a hospital 20 minutes away.
My escape window is closing.

205
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,341
I gotta keep this kid
from blabbing the second he's admitted.

206
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,404
Okay, Theo,

207
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,659
I'm going to give you a little nap,
all right?

208
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,411
Cary Conrad uses this stuff all the time.

209
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,248
So it shouldn't exacerbate
your head injury.

210
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,290
Too much.

211
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,633
Julie.

212
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,803
Julia.

213
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,972
Julia Quinn-Goldberg.

214
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,141
-Who do you think it was?
-Word on the street is mugging.

215
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,560
-[Andrew] "The street"? Name your source.
-I saw a tweet.

216
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,853
From "the street"?

217
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,770
[group chuckling]

218
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,606
[Brandon]
No, we went past the crime scene.

219
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,734
There was a lot of blood.
I bet it was Matthew.

220
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,820
-But why on earth would Matthew--?
-Sherry's blog. They're hiding.

221
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,780
Matthew is insane.

222
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,241
And Ryan reported
on the Natalie investigation.

223
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,328
What if Ryan was asking
too many questions?

224
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,122
Hey, hey, heads up!
Fifty grand coming through.

225
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,957
-Not a fan?
-He's my ex.

226
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,586
[Brandon] What if the only way
to hide the truth was to murder him?

227
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,839
The library fundraiser's coming up.
My boss asked me to work late.

228
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,382
Yeah. He's a gem.

229
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,802
He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up.

230
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,476
[Kiki] Not up to your standards?

231
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,729
[Love] Yeah.

232
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,440
Can't all be winners.

233
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,736
Hey, can you make
two dozen bloody-looking ones by tonight?

234
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,614
I'm having my true-crime book club
over to dish.

235
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,531
Yeah, sure.

236
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,870
What's your theory?
I think, his ex, Marienne Bellamy, right?

237
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,498
My lawyer friend said
that they were in a custody fight,

238
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,417
and she seems off, you know?

239
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,129
Her ex becomes all successful
and then when she wants him back,

240
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,882
she can't
and it's, like, crime of passion.

241
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,551
What do you think?

242
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,430
You're all scandal-hungry crows
and no amount of feasting

243
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,350
on other people's sorrows is gonna
make your lives less hollow.

244
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,653
PMS.

246
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,238
Right.

247
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,826
-I'll have those cupcakes for you.
-Great. Thank you.

248
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,203
Hey, guys.

249
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,121
Hi.

250
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,250
Get away from me!

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,419
-It was only supposed to graze you.
-No! That--

252
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,754
-[Sherry] You just made me so mad!
-That was your pull--

253
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,091
-Hey.
-Hey.

254
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,010
Hey.

255
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,485
-You know, you were right.
-What?

256
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,156
Joe's cheating.

257
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,621
Oh.

258
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,957
Oh.

259
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,085
Love.

260
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:27,838
Kill him.

261
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,052
He was abusive.

262
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,512
He forced you into this.

263
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,225
I'll back you up. You know I will.
Then you can let me out.

264
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,143
Us.

265
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,521
You can let us out.

266
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,692
Everybody will believe you.
It's always the husbands.

267
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:53,781
You know, they force us
into these shapes and we break.

268
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,202
But you and me, we're strong, right?

269
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,788
All you gotta do is...

270
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,501
He fucking betrayed you, Love.

271
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,305
You're a fucking monster.

272
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,520
I always knew your marriage was a sham.

273
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:31,110
But... it looks like the only murderer
in this room is you, Sherry.

274
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,746
I can't believe that you just did that.

275
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,503
[Joe] Unceremonious,

276
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,713
dumping Theo at a loading dock,
but he's safe.

277
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,632
Now there's no time to pack.

278
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,469
It'll be a miracle if I can get us out
before Love gets suspicious.

279
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,306
-Oh, hey, Joe.
-Hey, Lansing.

280
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,725
Hey, Dante, I'm here to pick up Henry.

281
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,854
-Love picked him up two hours ago?
-Yeah.

282
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,397
[Joe] No.

283
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,233
-Oh, great.
-Was that not the plan?

284
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,860
[Joe] No, it sure wasn't.

285
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,779
It was. She texted me
and I spaced, so I'm sorry.

286
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,281
Nice to see you both.

287
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,491
See you.

288
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,120
[Joe] Oh, no.

289
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
She can't know.

290
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,680
-Smells amazing.
-[chuckles]

291
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,223
How could she know?

292
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,309
It's roast chicken.

293
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,396
-Hmm. Where's Henry?
-He's asleep.

294
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,733
-I'm gonna check on him.
-No.

295
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,401
Sit.

296
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,069
[Joe] She knows.

297
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,704
[Love] Mm.

298
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,167
Tastes amazing as ever.

299
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,086
-I'm a great cook.
-You are.

300
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,337
You really are.

301
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,756
And I'm great in bed.

302
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,970
Pretty, funny, devoted wife and mom.

303
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,263
It's all true.

304
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,057
Hey, did you check out Twitter today?

305
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,018
A news guy was murdered.

306
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,980
Ryan Goodwin.

307
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,899
I was like, "Where do I know him from?"

308
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,860
So I Googled him, and...

309
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,155
he's your boss's ex-husband.

310
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,783
And I saw him at the library thing.

311
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
Where I saw her.

312
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,621
Marienne.

313
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,001
She was lovely.

314
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,962
Stunning, actually.

315
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,756
-Love--
-Do you love her?

316
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,762
I just want the truth.

317
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,768
Oh.

318
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,942
Did you ever actually love me?

319
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,528
The moment I saw you.

320
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,741
I would do anything for you.

321
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,618
I know that you cheated on me
and you lied.

322
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,078
Okay, can we--?

323
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,581
You made me feel like you really saw me.

324
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,044
Like you were perfectly happy.

325
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,045
[chuckles]

326
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,631
You made me feel
like I needed to protect you.

327
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,596
You got so upset
killing objectively horrible people.

328
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,558
So I thought, "He's sensitive.
I can do this for him."

329
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,518
I don't remember you asking.

330
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,105
And then I come to find out
that you are happy to murder,

331
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,815
just for a different woman.

332
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,151
Meanwhile, here I am doing it for you.

333
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,153
A teenager, someone innocent.

334
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:47,157
Yeah, right. He's just a kid,
who you were having an affair with.

335
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:53,246
We can do this if you are willing to admit
you have not been perfectly happy either.

336
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,167
We have both made mistakes.

337
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,089
I have made some...

338
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,383
big ones.

339
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,802
And I'm sorry, Love.

340
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
I never wanted to hurt you.

341
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,099
I tried, and I know
that you've been trying too.

342
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,434
But it didn't work.

343
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,814
And now we can be honest about that

344
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,483
and deal with this like two adults.

345
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,945
-Meaning what?
-We don't have to do anything impulsive.

346
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,071
What's that mean?

347
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,451
James. James.

348
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,414
What you did to him
when he tried to leave.

349
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,211
-Your mother knew and she told me.
-My mother is a malicious bitch.

350
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:45,215
All I'm saying is
that we can part ways amicably.

351
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,300
Be there for Henry,
support him, co-parent,

352
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,886
and give each other
the chance to be happy.

353
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,143
Love...

354
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,398
I want a divorce.

355
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,285
[Henry crying]

356
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,287
I'm gonna go check on him.

357
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,664
-Let me get--
-No, I'll check him. I'll get him.

358
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,180
[Joe]
She may come back with Henry or a machete.

359
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,563
Henry's settled down.

360
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,068
You look like you're gonna throw up.

361
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,198
Well, I just said the D-word to my wife.

362
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,742
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

363
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,371
Look, Joe...

364
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,626
I don't like feeling like this.

365
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,923
-I'm so sorry. I--
-No. No.

366
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,508
You're right.

367
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,596
I always thought
that if I did everything right,

368
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,681
life would turn out
the way it's supposed to.

369
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,808
Doesn't that seem reasonable?

370
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,560
I mean, like, with James...

371
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,438
I took care of him.

372
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,319
Doesn't it seem reasonable to think

373
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,154
that he'd wanna be with me
when he got better?

374
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,532
But...

375
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,411
Here's what I need you
to know about James.

376
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,080
My mom was right.

377
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:41,915
I did.

378
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,125
I did kill him.

379
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,255
But I didn't mean to.

380
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,177
That was my first time using it, and...

381
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,265
the dosage was too high when ingested.

382
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,518
What dosage was too high?

383
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,644
Aconite.

384
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,397
It's a paralytic.

385
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,691
I just wanted to--

386
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,068
I just wanted to stop him.

387
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,196
Keep him in one place
so we could talk it through.

388
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,116
-You wanted to paralyze him?
-Exactly. Yeah.

389
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,743
Temporarily.

390
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,459
Now, you don't have to worry.

391
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,091
This time,
I'm letting it absorb through the skin.

392
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,266
[Joe] Oh, no. No, no, no.

393
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,602
Do I need to point out
that none of this would be happening

394
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,978
if you hadn't grabbed a weapon?

395
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
[Joe] Oh, wow.

396
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,028
No one will ever love you like I do, Joe.

397
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,825
It's something to think about
while you're lying there.

398
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,333
[Joe] Okay, this isn't great.

399
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,503
-Love...
-[phone chimes]

400
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,946
[groans]

401
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,744
Apparently, I need
to deliver some cupcakes.

402
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,291
I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.

403
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:54,172
Then... I'm gonna save
our fucking marriage.

404
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,761
[Joe] What the fuck am I gonna do now?

405
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,809
Theo, come on, answer your texts.

406
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,105
Look, we're mad, that's fine.
But now I'm worried.

407
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,025
Call me back or I'm calling the police.
I'm serious.

408
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:29,958
Hello?

409
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,420
Joe?

410
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,008
Theo!

411
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,761
Theo!

412
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,144
-Holy shit.
-[Joe] Holy shit.

413
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,146
What the fuck did she do to you?

414
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,857
What's going on? Is Theo here?

415
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,443
[Joe] Thank you.
If I could just get my voice to work...

416
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,779
-[groaning]
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

417
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,532
[Joe] No! Shit. He calls the police,
truth comes out and I lose Henry.

418
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,533
[Joe groaning]

419
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,827
What? What?

420
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,413
What are you trying to say?

421
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,416
-You don't want me to call the police?
-[Joe] Yes! Yes, thank you.

422
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,919
What?

423
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,884
You have Theo.

424
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,052
Uh-huh.

425
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,929
Where is he?

426
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,724
Joe, what did she do?

427
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,645
Where is my son?

428
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,689
[Joe] In the hospital. In the hospital!

429
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,942
You know what Love's been doing
with him, don't you?

430
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,277
You sick fuck!

431
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,321
[Joe groaning]

432
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,616
You took Natalie from me, didn't you?

433
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,409
Didn't you?

434
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,870
Your crazy fucking wife.

435
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:54,167
You knew, and you sat in my house
and you said nothing.

436
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,671
I should kill you.

437
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,801
I should kill you right fucking now.

438
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,679
-What?
-[Joe] Follow my eyes.

439
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,265
Come on. I'm pointing with my eyes.

440
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,270
Check the search history.
You're a tech guy, you know this.

441
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,534
Saint Benedict's Hospital?
This is where Theo is?

442
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,203
-[Joe] I'm blinking. Yes.
-That what you're saying?

443
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,331
He better be okay.

444
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,793
Yeah.

445
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,253
No police.

446
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,046
No fucking help.

447
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:44,133
You deserve what Natalie got
a hundred times over, neighbor.

448
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,180
Enjoy whatever Love does to you.

449
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,477
What are you even doing?

450
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,146
The weak spot will reveal itself.

451
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,358
-Weak spots always do.
-Okay.

452
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,029
Maybe we should talk about
what I said when Love was here.

453
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,823
I admire it.

454
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm over here trying to save us both
and you've got strategy.

455
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,416
Will you leave the wall alone?

456
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,375
No.

457
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,753
Because whether you love me
or even respect me,

458
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,381
I can figure out a simple cage.

459
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:28,720
I hacked my body. I hacked the shit
out of our marriage. I can hack this.

460
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
[groans]

461
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,145
What was so bad about our marriage?

462
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,855
What are you talking about?

463
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,149
You hack everything.

464
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,942
Ovulation, child-rearing.

465
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,652
Sure. To get it right.

466
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,572
-To be good enough for you.
-That's hilarious.

467
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,573
I mean it!

468
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,451
Or have you forgotten
that you were a golden boy

469
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,537
and I was this uptight grad student
in huge glasses

470
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,415
-who your mom hated.
-My mom hates everyone.

471
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,335
And I loved you in those glasses.

472
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:06,591
I've loved every version of you, Sherry.

473
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,512
Everything I've done
since the day I laid eyes on you...

474
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,223
it was for you.

475
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,393
-Guess I'm an idiot.
-You're not.

476
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,022
-You're not.
-You know, Sherry,

477
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,774
until I met you,

478
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,985
I had massive inflammation,

479
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,197
undiagnosed lactose intolerance,

480
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,783
and I did coke every weekend.

481
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,912
I was just powering through
until I met you

482
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,538
and I saw,

483
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,875
she's together, she is optimized.

484
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,545
She is so much smarter than me.

485
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,546
Honey...

486
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,842
I didn't fall in love with you
'cause you were smart.

487
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,221
Ow, ow.

488
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,014
Oh, sweetie.

489
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,349
Come here, come here.

490
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,185
That's okay.

491
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,813
That's okay.

492
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,942
-The truth came out.
-No, no, I wasn't even...

493
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,777
You are smart.

494
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,488
I just mean, I fell for...

495
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,866
sweet and brave...

496
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,995
slay-any-dragon...

497
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,125
smart-enough-to-know-that-I'm-smarter-
but-you-don't-mind-that.

498
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,254
I love that.

499
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,425
You're the best dad to the best kids.

500
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,677
And don't forget 6% body fat.

501
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,638
You're down to--? Jesus.

502
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,184
When we get out of here,
you're gonna have all the burgers.

503
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,438
And you'll be the hottest
one-eared bitch in Madre Linda.

504
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,153
[door opens]

505
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,330
[whispering] Hey.
I'm gonna put him to bed, he's asleep.

506
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,591
[Joe] This is not
how I imagined this ending.

507
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,176
Us ending.

508
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,761
Me.

509
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,519
Perfect. I got here just in time.

510
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,105
Okay.

511
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,983
Don't you worry, Joe.

512
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,527
It's gonna be over real soon.

513
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,324
[knocking on door]

514
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,915
Oh, hey, I--

515
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,959
Got a text from Joe? That was me.

516
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,171
Come in?

517
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,175
-Yeah, no. I should--
-If you have any self-respect,

518
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,135
you'll come in,
so we can speak like adults.

519
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,599
Okay, sure.

520
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,275
[Joe] Don't fall for it.
She's gonna kill you.

521
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,152
We'll only have this conversation once.

522
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,864
But I need to know,
of all the men in Madre Linda,

523
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,199
why my husband?

524
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,828
Fuck. He told me
that you two are separating--

525
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,163
He did? Oh. That's news to me.

526
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,916
-I am sorry. What?
-He lied.

527
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,253
[Joe] Get out. Get out.

528
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,089
I'm so sorry. I--

529
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,425
He told me you two were splitting. I--

530
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,219
I really never would have...

531
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,681
Look, I'm-- I'm a good person.

532
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,933
Or maybe I'm not, but I am trying.

533
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,102
You didn't answer my question.

534
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,437
Why Joe?

535
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,525
Was he kind to you?

536
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
Effortlessly get you?

537
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,659
Smart? Deep?

538
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,037
Good father material?

539
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,665
Yes.

540
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,711
-At first.
-What's that supposed to mean?

541
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,045
I should've trusted my gut.

542
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,299
Something in me knew
that it was too good to be true,

543
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,216
but I just...

544
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,010
He convinced me.

545
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,888
I let him convince me.

546
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,601
I used to think that toxic men looked
at me and saw an easy mark.

547
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,144
And I've looked at myself...

548
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,981
and something in me
that's attracted to toxicity.

549
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,401
[Joe]
No, don't throw yourself under the bus.

550
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,986
She's distorting things.

551
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,030
[Love] "Toxic"?

552
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,159
What if I told you
Joe's the one who killed your ex?

553
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,038
No, Ryan was--

554
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,790
No, Ryan was mugged.

555
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,085
Uh-huh.

556
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,632
[Marienne] Why would--?

557
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,009
-Why would Joe...?
-[Joe] To protect you.

558
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,344
Because he's obsessed with you.

559
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,180
[Joe] No, I saved you. I did a good thing.

560
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,557
When he's obsessed with someone,
he'll do anything.

561
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,808
I should know.

562
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,853
He was obsessed with me...

563
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,105
until he met you.

564
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,565
-[door opens]
-[Juliette] Mom?

565
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,151
-[Marienne] Hey.
-I have to pee.

566
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,487
Okay, sweetie. I'm almost done, okay?

567
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,030
Give me five minutes.

568
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,618
Oh, you know what?
You can go use the restroom down the hall.

569
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,535
Yeah.

570
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,331
Yeah. Okay.

571
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,540
Come on, baby.

572
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,751
[door closes]

573
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,545
Hi.

574
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,465
[Marienne] Go straight in there,
around the corner.

575
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,262
[Joe] Look this way. Look. Come on.

576
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,097
Shit.

577
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,772
Marienne?

578
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,567
Um...

579
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,072
You... and your beautiful daughter,
you need to run.

580
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,866
Disappear.

581
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,785
Ryan's the beginning of what he'll do.

582
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,578
[Joe] Say you don't believe her.

583
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,081
Say you love me, you trust me.

584
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,709
Then why aren't you running too?

585
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,546
It's not that simple for me.

586
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,423
No.

587
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,844
Okay, listen to me,
maybe it's not my place,

588
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:29,223
but maybe you think you owe it to your kid
or you're clinging to when things worked,

589
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,767
but, please, if there is ever...

590
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,438
even for a fleeting moment,

591
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,481
a tiny voice in your head,

592
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,359
and that tiny voice is telling you,
"I deserve better"...

593
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,695
listen to her.

594
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,698
That's your partner.

595
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,659
That's your real, true love.

596
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,913
And if you betray her long enough,
you will lose her.

597
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,336
Trust me, I'm still trying
to get mine back.

598
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,426
[Juliette] Mom?

599
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,554
Hey, baby.

600
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,056
Hey.

601
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,809
-Thank you.
-[Love] Of course.

602
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,984
[Marienne] You ready? Okay, come on.

603
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,862
[Joe] Did you believe Love's lies?

604
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,615
You knew it was a trap.
You would've said anything to get out.

605
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,869
-A luxury I don't seem to have.
-[door opens, then closes]

606
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,127
I'd see why you like her.

607
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,546
Tough.

608
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,424
She's got a cute kid.

609
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,595
I can't believe I almost took
that little girl's mother away from her.

610
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,515
The insanity you drive me to, Joe.

611
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,435
Marienne's gonna be fine. More than fine.

612
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,979
She really makes being
a single mother look good.

613
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,524
Noble.

614
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,114
I barely recognize myself anymore.

615
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,449
I was so...

616
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,327
excited.

617
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,704
To be a mother.

618
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,083
And your wife.

619
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,378
And as soon as I became that...

620
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,589
you punished me for it.

621
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,804
I mean, you gaslit me so fucking hard.

622
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,224
I started to question...

623
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,936
every single thing about myself.

624
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,074
But that little voice
in the back of my head

625
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,453
that I've been suppressing
this whole fucking time, it was right.

626
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,751
I'm not the problem.

627
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,255
My husband is the problem.

628
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,798
[suspenseful music playing]

629
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,350
-[screams]
-[Joe] Aconite, when injected directly,

630
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,812
burns as it moves
through the system to the heart.

631
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,564
Think less slow paralysis,

632
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,192
more total fucking agony.

633
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,652
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

634
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,198
Did you really think
that I wouldn't start to wonder...

635
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,036
what you were growing in the garden?

636
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,958
Wolf's-bane.

637
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,085
-A paralytic.
-No.

638
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,504
It slows the heart.

639
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,756
So I Googled antidotes.

640
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,467
Turns out, I needed biohacking.
Adrenaline.

641
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,178
And who doesn't have that
around here, right?

642
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,931
A little voice in my head
told me to take it.

643
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,684
Before you played your hand.

644
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,977
[Henry crying]

645
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,734
Joe...

646
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,862
You did this to yourself.

647
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:19,578
And the hardest part was making
the dose because I couldn't lie to myself.

648
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,290
It had to be enough.

649
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,086
I had to finally stop you.

650
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,881
[sobbing] We're perfect for each other.

651
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,301
But bad...

652
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,346
for Henry.

653
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:44,061
He'll know what you are.

654
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:09,169
Those sadistic, tacky,
Los Angeles, little bitches.

655
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,842
Hey.

656
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,011
Hey, don't give up on me, baby.

657
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,971
No, baby. Give me a flag, Cary.

658
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,681
Cary, give me a flag!

659
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,607
Sexy.

660
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,611
No!

661
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,112
No, no, no!

662
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,615
No, we're not letting them win, baby. No!

663
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,450
They'll turn on each other.

664
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,910
Those two-faced, vanilla pieces of shit.

665
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,418
There's a key in here.

666
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,005
Those freaky bitches
don't trust each other.

667
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,341
Baby, they're the weak spot.

668
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,759
They're the weak spot.

669
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,431
[Joe] All I've ever wanted
was to give Henry

670
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,516
the best life I could imagine.

671
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,226
But what if Love was right?

672
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,896
Maybe she will take the fall
for this whole mess,

673
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,397
but I'm married to her.

674
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,232
If I go down too...

675
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,526
what happens to our son?

676
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,655
After Dottie's meltdown,
Love drew up papers

677
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:22,534
to prevent the Quinns from ever getting
near him, but if not them or me, then--

678
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,121
I can't let him get put
somewhere like I was.

679
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,758
Jacob?

680
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,134
Jakey, let's go.

681
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,100
Such a nice day, right?

682
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,354
There's nothing I'd rather do
than be with you, buddy.

683
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,199
Done?

684
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,536
Oh, my God.

685
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,915
-Joey? How did you find--?
-Do you hate me?

686
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,876
-What?
-You think I'm bad.

687
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,504
What I did.

688
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,299
-Joey...
-Mom, what's wrong with me?

689
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,224
I know you try so hard to be good.

690
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,521
Then why'd you leave me there?

691
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,484
And why are you taking care of him?

692
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:39,987
I just--

693
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,575
I made too many mistakes.

694
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,704
And even though I loved you,
still love you...

695
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,707
I was hurting you too.

696
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,089
Sometimes we need to start over, Joey.

697
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,884
Completely.

698
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,888
[Joe] I didn't have good parents.

699
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,891
But I know what a good parent does.

700
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,851
Protect.

701
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,396
Even if that means protecting from.

702
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,774
