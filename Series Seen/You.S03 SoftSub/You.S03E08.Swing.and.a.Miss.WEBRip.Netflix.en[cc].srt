1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,310
[Joe] Previously on You:

2
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,521
I need to look at particular people
on particular dates.

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,983
I know Theo has a crush on me.
I could pretend like he had a chance.

4
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,611
Love's first husband asked for a divorce.
Next thing you know, he was dead.

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,489
[Joe] Look at you,
making the world more beautiful.

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,160
I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I will stay ahead of her this time.

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,661
Cary and I are polyamorous.

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,498
And we would love to take
our relationship to a new level.

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,293
Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,546
[Joe] Opening our marriage? This loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.

11
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,214
No idea is too crazy.

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,175
For you.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,932
[Joe] Here's the thing, Marienne,

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,062
I'm a monogamist.
Some might even say a serial monogamist.

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,566
So imagine my surprise when my wife
suggested we read up on polyamory,

16
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,445
aka swinging, aka the lifestyle,

17
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,573
aka a flatlining marriage's dying gasp.

18
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,033
Is it mortifying?

19
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,412
[sighs] Well...

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,831
"Happily ever after is a myth

21
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,708
because people are not static.

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,545
Our partners do not owe us a guarantee
that they will never change."

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,174
Okay. It's not crazy.

24
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,010
I'm gonna go check on Henry.
I think he'll wake up soon.

25
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,474
I'm leaving out the part where if
your marriage isn't on rock-solid footing,

26
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,185
swinging is all but guaranteed to nuke it,

27
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,646
aka the dream.

28
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,944
Still, after my conversation with Dottie
about the fate of Love's first husband,

29
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,821
I need to tread lightly.

30
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,449
Be game but not too. Make it all her idea.

31
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,550
The Love I first met was a free spirit.

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,345
Reality has disappointed her
since we moved to Madre Linda.

33
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:22,976
I can make it easy to leave me,
no hard feelings, to go follow her bliss.

34
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,271
I learned a new word. "Compersion."

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,397
Yeah?

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,111
Vicarious joy from seeing your partner
have joyful sexual relations with another.

37
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,696
Hm.

38
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,035
I don't know if this is a good idea.

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,620
Shit. Too game.

40
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,081
I'm not sure
we're in a solid enough place.

41
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,292
Okay, back off for a while.

42
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,962
Can I ask you something?

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,341
Did you and James ever
do anything like this?

44
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,887
No, he wasn't much of a risk taker.

45
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,555
Plus...

46
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,975
we weren't very far
into our marriage when...

47
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,979
-Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to ask.
-No, it's fine.

48
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,440
James didn't really know what he wanted.

49
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,568
We were planning on having a baby,

50
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,154
and he got cold feet.

51
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,032
And then he got sick,

52
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,828
which was obviously very scary.

53
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,164
But he used it like a shield.

54
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:31,169
And I wasn't, like,
allowed to be mad. Ever.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,754
I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,340
That my wife almost definitely
murdered her first husband.

57
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,925
It's fine. [chuckles softly]

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,927
-I probably sound like an asshole.
-No.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,969
Worse.

60
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,555
James let himself become
the villain of their story.

61
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,183
I cannot be the villain of ours.

62
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,100
Listen.

63
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,897
I'm not going anywhere.
Let's not rush this swinging thing.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,898
It just--

65
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,360
It isn't me.

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,111
It isn't us.

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,740
Which is exactly why we're going to do it.

68
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,201
[theme music playing]

69
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,583
Hey, Dante. You got a sec?

70
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,168
Hey, yeah. What's up?

71
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,086
Well...

72
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,340
If you don't mind me asking,
you and Lansing,

73
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,343
you guys have been together for how long?

74
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,511
Let's see.

75
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,848
We met when Lansing's boys were 3.
So 13 years.

76
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,434
Stop me if this is too personal.

77
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,563
Have you two always been monogamous?

78
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,066
Are you asking because I'm gay?

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,278
Oh, no. No, no, no. I--

80
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,488
[laughs] I'm fucking with you.

81
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,784
And the answer is, technically, no.

82
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,910
Technically?

83
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,745
We tried a threesome once.

84
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,957
We'd been married a year
and our lives were just work,

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,709
kids, eat, sleep, repeat.

86
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,671
-But Lansing wanted to spice things up.
-How'd he convince you?

87
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,672
Didn't have to.

88
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,590
I love him so much.

89
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,803
I thought if this is what he wanted,
I should at least try it.

90
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,806
Just got off the phone with Amy Woodruff.

91
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,225
That name is familiar because...?

92
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,228
She edited every children's book
I'm obsessed with.

93
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,855
-Great.
-Oh, that's cool.

94
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,940
She was calling to congratulate me

95
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,943
on being a finalist
in her imprint's illustration contest...

96
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,946
-Congratulations.
-...which I did not submit for.

97
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,992
But I seem to recall mentioning to you.

98
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,370
Yeah, yeah. Guilty, I...

99
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,831
I knew you wanted to submit, so--

100
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,166
Dante give us a sec.

101
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,625
[whistling]

102
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,423
Was I not clear?
You're a married man, we are not a thing.

103
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,092
No, we're friends. That's it.
But you missed the deadline

104
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,094
-for the last submission.
-I did.

105
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,557
Knowing how much
you beat yourself up over that, I just--

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,018
Decided to do it for me?

107
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,187
I decided to help
because I knew you would win.

108
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,439
The world should see your work.

109
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,692
They're my deadlines to miss.

110
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,696
Yeah, message received.

111
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,243
You're right. Listen, I'm not the type
of guy to go around sticking my nose in,

112
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,788
so I'm sorry.

113
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,206
Good.

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,462
-Can I go back to being excited now?
-Please.

115
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,839
[squeals]

116
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,635
Um, I've gotta...

117
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,220
-Fuck. Of course.
-Yep.

118
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,847
[Joe] Great. It's Madre Linda's
most respected drug fiend.

119
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,434
Your custody hearing is approaching
and suddenly I'm seeing a lot more of him.

120
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,729
-Hi, Ryan.
-Well, you're in a good mood.

121
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,149
Yeah, it's, um, been nice having Juliette.

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,818
Smart to keep good news from him.

123
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,320
-So you ready for that thing on Friday?
-That thing?

124
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,449
Where you convince a judge that you're
not using our daughter to punish me?

125
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,368
I would've rather worked things out
like adults.

126
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,662
I thought that's what we were doing.

127
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,790
Juliette, time to go.

128
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,583
-Already?
-[Ryan] Don't argue.

129
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,212
Let me help you, baby.

130
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,214
[Joe] This is hard on your daughter.

131
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,426
I wish I could fix it.
I wanna fix everything for you.

132
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,553
-Did you have fun? All right.
-Mm-hm.

133
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,479
Henry's down for the night.

134
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,025
Hey.

135
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,404
Come to bed.

136
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,949
[Joe] Mm. Trying to reignite the spark,

137
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,035
and my move here is make it not so easy.

138
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,213
[sighs]

139
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,673
Sorry.

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,718
Long day.

141
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,179
Okay.

142
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,851
-How are we gonna get back to us?
-Love, I'm just tired.

143
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,269
Yeah. Or bored.

144
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,062
So far, so good.

145
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,356
-No, I'm-- No, I--
-Maybe that's...

146
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,942
just what marriage does.

147
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,612
You know, I love us.

148
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:12,158
It's-- But it's-- It's known.
You know, I want a secret.

149
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,493
I wanna still be fun.

150
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,786
-You are fun.
-No, I mean, like, wild.

151
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,581
Like, you remember
those first few months we--

152
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,251
-You know?
-Yeah.

153
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,463
And now that's just over?

154
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,051
Because I'm a mom and a wife,

155
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,886
I can't be...?

156
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,681
Be honest.

157
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,810
Don't Sherry and Cary seem
more interesting

158
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,646
now that we know they swing?

159
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,441
-I thought you didn't want to.
-I don't know what I want.

160
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,401
I got married so young.

161
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,363
There's a lot of things
I never got to try.

162
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:56,285
Well, the last thing I wanna do is stand
between you and anything you want.

163
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,454
I have to guide her. Gently.

164
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,166
Do you have any fantasies?

165
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,088
Like, did you ever experiment?

166
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,300
Okay, I made out drunkenly
with my college roommate, you know...

167
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,095
-Total cliché.
-Total.

168
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,972
See. Boring.

169
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,975
No, I'm kidding.
I haven't done any experimenting either.

170
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
-So you've never had a threesome?
-No.

171
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,647
Unless you count under the bed
with Peach Salinger and her drug dealer.

172
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,940
You ever kiss a guy?

173
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,193
Would you?

174
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:34,323
Under the right circumstances,
I don't see why not.

175
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,161
Wow. Yeah, this is just fun
to talk about. [laughs]

176
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,663
[Joe] Time to move to the next step.

177
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:46,335
In all honesty, reading books is great.
But it does somehow feel clinical.

178
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,755
We could talk to the experts.

179
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,715
Bull's-eye.

180
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,135
I'm sure Sherry and Cary would be happy
to give us a walk-through.

181
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,429
I know you're not Sherry's biggest fan.

182
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,014
[Joe] I'd rather fuck a cactus.

183
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,766
We're talking strictly physical, right?

184
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,979
It would be with Cary.
Also strictly physical.

185
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,565
Yeah, I'm not threatened by Cary
in the slightest.

186
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,402
-We would just be asking them questions.
-Yeah, we're not committing to anything.

187
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,530
[Cary] The nondisclosure is mandatory.

188
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,825
It's standard practice in a community
as tight-knit as ours.

189
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,744
So do you do a lot of these?

190
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,080
Can't confirm or deny but, I mean,

191
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,877
everyone in Madre Linda has tried
the lifestyle at some point.

192
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,089
[Joe] Huh. The burbs are even more
miserable than I thought.

193
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,092
Um-- I, um...

194
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,598
Aw, damn you.

195
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,018
Oh, yeah, those look worth fucking
my glycemic variability for.

196
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,645
Okay. Well...

197
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,356
-Mm.
-Here you go.

198
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:04,955
So, when you started the lifestyle,
were you two already in a good place?

199
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,626
Not as good as we are now.

200
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:14,548
Our marriage grew rock solid
through these little trust falls.

201
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,342
We can take you through a Q and A.

202
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,428
You know, no "presh,"
you'll see, the whole thing, it's very...

203
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,056
You're in control.

204
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,058
Great. Okay.

205
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,937
So let's just get started.
Obviously, STIs we should know about?

206
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,605
-No.
-Good.

207
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,732
Love, let's talk menstruation.

208
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,402
Um, I'm not due for another three weeks.

209
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,653
Cycle twins.

210
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,029
[laughing]

211
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,824
And our kids are at camp through August.

212
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,243
Okay, well, we--

213
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,995
We have a great babysitter.

214
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,083
Henry could stay
the night there if, you know...

215
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,961
[Joe] Suddenly this feels real.
They really are pros.

216
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,756
Well, let's get to the fun stuff.
What are you comfy with?

217
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
Joe, start with an easy one.

218
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,263
Are you good
with Love and I getting physical?

219
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,348
Yeah.

220
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,767
Girl-on-girl, usually a given.

221
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,893
Love and Cary.

222
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,855
[Joe] I couldn't care less
but can't appear too game.

223
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,440
I mean...

224
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,609
I trust you.

225
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,198
Love, are you good
with Joe and Cary fooling around?

226
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,116
Sure.

227
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,160
But-- Are you...?

228
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,915
For the public,
the brand is conventional monogamy.

229
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,837
Some don't understand that
a bisexual man is a truly optimized man.

230
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,217
Okay, I can keep an open mind.

231
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,471
For you, Marienne,
I will walk through fire.

232
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,723
-What about Joe and me?
-Seeing as Love killed

233
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,892
-the last woman I almost slept with...
-That's a no.

234
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,603
-It's fine by me. What do you mean?
-I...

235
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,688
-Do you not want to?
-No, no, no. I thought--

236
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,898
Why?

237
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,109
-Because...
-Okay. Moving too fast.

238
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,779
-Yeah.
-Oh, what's happening?

239
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,822
We've been doing this a while,

240
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,200
and we can tell
when a foundation's a little shaky.

241
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,411
No shame, it's just you two are so...

242
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,706
young.

243
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,502
Hit us up if you get on the same page.

244
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,217
-What the fuck just happened?
-[Joe] A major setback.

245
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,719
[Dante] Miss Bellamy.

246
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,057
Let's talk about your day-to-day routine
with visitation.

247
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,100
Who prepares your child's meals?

248
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:35,147
When Juliette's with me, I do.
When she's with Ryan, his mother does.

249
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,442
'Cause Juliette loves the taste
of unseasoned chicken.

250
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,362
[Joe] Even when you're practicing
for court, you're still delightful.

251
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,281
Excellent. Don't say that last part.

252
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,117
How would you describe
your recovery from addiction?

253
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,330
-Well, I have my weekly meetings...
-Nope. In the four years since.

254
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,041
-Give me a second.
-She's doing really well.

255
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,459
She needs to be perfect.

256
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,920
I stand before you
with an Ivy League education

257
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,797
and two successful stepsons.

258
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,050
We have been trying to adopt
for three years.

259
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,094
There's always a snag.

260
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,512
I'm being hard on you

261
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,224
-because I know what you're up against.
-I know. I'm trying, I just...

262
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,685
The fucker is plotting something,
and I can feel it.

263
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,855
We'll get there. Keep practicing.

264
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,941
Thank you, Dante.

265
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:19,984
[phone buzzing]

266
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,404
And I gotta go give Charlie
his lunch break.

267
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,245
-Can I actually talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

268
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,673
So I know it's a lot to ask,

269
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:47,094
but it would mean so much to me
if you would be a character witness

270
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,053
at my hearing?

271
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,473
Of course. You're an incredible asset
to the library.

272
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,933
Cool. Great. Thanks.

273
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,855
But I actually need you to play up
the whole kick-ass mom thing.

274
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,276
I will character witness
the motherly living shit out of you.

275
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,277
Thank you.

276
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,579
Um...

277
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,167
Yeah, thank you. Uh--

278
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,379
[Joe] That was hope.

279
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,131
The least I can do...

280
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
is hasten the end of my marriage.

281
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,681
[phone buzzing]

282
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,396
Speak of the devil.

283
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
I guess we're having fun now.

284
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:56,121
The swinging book say to test your comfort
by role-playing little scenarios.

285
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,499
Okay, here we go.

286
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,919
The fuck?

287
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,173
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's my bad.

288
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:13,180
You know, it's-- It's not the most subtle
come-here of my life,

289
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,767
but I'm really--
I'm not complaining about it.

290
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,480
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't even see you there.

291
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,400
[Joe] Role-playing gets complicated fast,
evidently.

292
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,445
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't mean to throw this over here.

293
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,947
-[chuckles]
-Um...

294
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,951
I saw Joe's car in the driveway.

295
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,868
Yeah.

296
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,663
He's taking a nap.

297
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,460
I know--
I know I should be chill but, like...

298
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,087
Theo.

299
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,590
Oh.

300
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
You know, actually, Joe--
That's Joe. He's awake.

301
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,184
And he's watching us.

302
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,149
Well, then we better behave.

303
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,443
Right.

304
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,821
Wait, um, the--

305
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698
Your dad. The office?

306
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,868
Yeah, I don't know. It's like--
It's impossible.

307
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,411
Okay.

308
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,581
But I'll figure it out.

309
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,708
I will.

310
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,044
Okay.

311
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,088
You're the best.

312
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
Fucking creep show.

313
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,235
Theo's still circling Matthew,
but he'll get there.

314
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,029
I gathered.

315
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,113
Did you?

316
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,865
Yeah.

317
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,992
How did that make you feel?

318
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,537
Jealous?

319
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,000
[Joe]
A large amount of nothing. However...

320
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,460
Possessive.

321
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
Yeah?

322
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,548
My wife needs to feel
like mildly transgressing

323
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,967
with that idiot rich kid did the trick.

324
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,767
She's not a boring, tired suburban mom.

325
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,560
[moaning]

326
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,356
She's fun. Wild.

327
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,568
Still the Love Quinn who flirts
with strangers in the produce section.

328
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,285
Which is why I'm going to satisfy her
as only someone who knows her can.

329
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,663
[continues moaning]

330
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,125
Safe. Reliable.

331
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,377
We can do anything together.

332
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,683
Satisfied but still hungry.

333
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,399
I love you so much.

334
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,319
That felt safe?

335
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,155
So safe.

336
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,447
Solid.

337
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,914
Do you think we're solid?
I think we're solid.

338
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,252
-I mean, if you think we are...
-Yeah.

339
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,296
You'll call the sitter? I'll text Sherry.

340
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,048
-Okay.
-Okay.

341
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,495
-Theo. What happened?
-The Wi-Fi went out.

342
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,122
-What?
-The Wi-Fi went out.

343
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,711
Okay, it's probably a brownout.
Just give it a minute.

344
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,134
Do you think it has to do with the dozens
of servers you snuck into your office?

345
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,515
Are you sleeping okay?
Are you getting enough to eat?

346
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,517

518
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,999
How am I supposed
to look at him in court tomorrow?

519
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,294
With pity. He's a piece of shit
and you're gonna win.

520
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,296
The rest...

521
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,966
we'll figure out, okay?

522
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,511
I'll help you,

523
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,723
if and only if you ask me to, of course.

524
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,020
Um...

525
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,356
Do you wanna come over?

526
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,191
I just...

527
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,069
I could really use a friend.

528
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,739
[Joe] I'd give anything to.

529
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,033
[Cary]
Joe, where the fuck are you, brother?

530
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,411
I wish I could, but...

531
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
No, no, no. It's okay.

532
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,626
No, you've actually-- You've done enough.

533
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,254
Thanks for answering, Goldberg.

534
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,392
You missed the finale in there.
Give it to me.

535
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,437
This will go in the phone bowl downstairs
with everybody else's.

536
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,439
[women giggling]

537
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,233
Well, it's go time.

538
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,492
Oh, welcome back.

539
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,745
I missed you.

540
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,121
[Joe] Someone's loose.

541
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,168
-Are you okay? You still seem tense.
-You think?

542
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,171
-I'm good. No, I'm good.
-He's just a little shy.

543
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,772
Oh, okay, so this is really happening.

544
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,194
Uh-- Mm. Ow.

545
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,864
Watch.

546
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,127
Is there something wrong?

547
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,797
Are you okay with this?

548
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,717
More than okay.

549
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,677
[Joe] I'm embarrassed for us.

550
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,943
Ooh.

551
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,657
This is fine. This is great, even.

552
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,662
Sorry to ask twice,
but is there something wrong?

553
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,248
Hey, sweetie,
just wait for the pill to kick in.

554
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,458
Oh, yeah.

555
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,793
I'm not used to an audience, I think.

556
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,631
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Just remember, look at your partner.

557
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,010
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, go.

558
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,848
But I don't want Love,
I don't want Sherry.

559
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,852
I don't want any of this.
All I want is you.

560
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,152
There you are.

561
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,945
There you are.

562
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,287
I knew you'd come.

563
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,222
[moans]

564
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,478
Big boy. [grunts]

565
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:09,941
Yes.

566
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,115
[moaning loudly]

567
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,717
Hakuna matata!

568
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,719
-Gotta be fucking kidding me.
-Fuck!

569
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,100
-Fuck. Somehow I just became the bad guy.
-No, it's okay. It's all right.

570
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,690
[Joe] Shit.

571
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,696
I cannot let her blame me
for this shit show.

572
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,327
Hey.

573
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,958
What happened?

574
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,963
Who is she?

575
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,133
Excuse me?

576
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,138
Who were you thinking about just then?

577
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,142
Nobody. Just you. It's always you.

578
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,101
Bullshit.

579
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,355
I know you, Joe.

580
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,442
I know what I do will never
be good enough for you.

581
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,446
This was your idea.

582
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,281
Well, I had to do something.

583
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,282
Or what?

584
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,328
Why do you act like I'm not all in?
I am right here.

585
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,247
All I do is worry about you.

586
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,957
I don't need you to worry about me.

587
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,211
I need your heart.

588
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,464
-Henry needs your heart.
-Leave Henry out of this.

589
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,924
I can't, Joe.

590
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,637
Unlike you, I have to be his mother 24/7.

591
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,223
In addition to running a fucking business,

592
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,517
keeping this house together,
dragging you to therapy,

593
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,146
trying to be my sexiest self so you don't
get bored and find another Natalie.

594
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,316
-Can you please lower your voice?
-Why? You hate hearing the truth?

595
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,695
-Our marriage is completely one-sided.
-That is absurd.

596
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,322
You made me kill her.

597
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,741
In addition
to being mother of the fucking year,

598
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,452
I had to run interference
on one of your fucking patterns!

599
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,621
-I killed Natalie for you!
-Shut...

600
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,748
up.

601
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,375
[floor creaking]

602
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,884
Was that...?

603
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,219
[Joe] Fuck me.

604
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,846
Maybe they didn't hear anything.

605
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,432
We have to know for sure.

606
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,144
Okay, well,

607
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,357
Sherry has this tell when she's lying,
she scratches her arm.

608
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,944
I'll follow your lead.

609
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,406
Okay.

610
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,251
[both moaning]

611
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,253
-There you are.
-Hey.

612
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,463
Take any longer,
I'd have to shuck the corn again.

613
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,676
I'm so sorry, guys. I just got in my head.

614
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,052
I'm good now.

615
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,347
I hope I didn't kill the vibe.

616
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,058
Oh, my God, of course not.

617
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,020
-It's so easy to get overwhelmed.
-Yeah.

618
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,104
Yeah.

619
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,856
Now...

620
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,190
[clears throat]

621
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,943
where were we?

622
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,658
[Joe] I just can't tell.

623
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,453
Something wrong?

624
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:55,124
Oh, I'm great.
Why don't we get on the bed?

625
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,259
Go.

626
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,766
Hey, Sherry.

627
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,647
[both grunting]

628
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,694
I don't know what you think you heard...

629
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,323
But we're...

630
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,622
[yelps]

631
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,084
There you go.
It's gonna end badly for Love too.

632
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,960
Sherry knows Krav Maga.

633
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,338
Go to sleep, buddy.

634
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,551
[yells]

635
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,582
[Sherry] Let me go!

636
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,044
No! No, please! No! God!

637
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,754
[Joe] That does not sound good.

638
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,382
He could be at Matthew's by now.

639
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,188
Guess I'm gonna use Cary's gift
from the hunting trip after all.

640
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,736
[shouts]

641
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,374
Cary, let's go back inside.
We can talk about this.

642
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,925
This is it. I never see you again.

643
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,762
I get impaled, Love goes to prison.

644
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,515
Henry grows up in the system.

645
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,103
No.

646
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,068
[Cary screams]

647
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,482
Are you okay?

648
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,764
[moaning]

649
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,905
Holy fucking shit.

650
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,243
I think that was the best sex
we've ever had.

651
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,579
[Joe] Yes, it was.

652
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,000
The spark our marriage needed
doesn't come from swinging.

653
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,754
Our love language is violence.

654
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,103
[Joe] Shit.

655
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,902
-Hey.
-What happened to the car?

656
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:20,240
Love spilled fruit sauce.
So I'm just getting it before it sets in.

657
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,617
At 5 a.m.?

658
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,328
Couldn't sleep.

659
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,413
Doesn't look like he's gotten much either.

660
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,498
You okay?

661
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,796
What was that last night?

662
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,257
Last night? Oh, we were--
I mean, were we that loud?

663
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,637
We had a kid with a sitter,
had a little fun.

664
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,264
With the Conrads? I saw their car.

665
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,227
Yeah, they were here for a second. Yeah.

666
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,520
Oh.

667
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,523
I thought I heard someone scream.

668
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:00,823
It was drunken shenanigans.
It was harmless, really. I'm embarrassed.

669
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,908
Stupid fun, really.

670
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,328
Yeah, you and your wife, Love.
Just having fun.

671
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,127
Yeah, again,
I apologize if it disturbed you.

672
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,130
We were saying we should have you over
for dinner sometime soon.

673
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,048
Yeah, real busy with work. But sometime.

674
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,759
Sometime.

675
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,500
I put my best friend...

676
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,628
in a cage.

677
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,340
Oh, my God.

678
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,554
I am so grateful for you.

679
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,225
I don't know anybody else
who would understand.

680
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,437
I don't know what I'd do without you.

681
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,571
Okay.

682
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,907
I'm gonna make breakfast

683
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,411
and then I can contact Henry's sitter
to see if they'll take him longer.

684
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,163
We can just clean up.

685
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,582
We'll go over there.
We'll "good cop, bad cop" them.

686
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,543
[Joe] She's too good at this now.
This should not be routine.

687
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,587
We will get through this, okay?

688
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,133
I don't want to, I want you--
Shit. Your custody hearing.

689
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,093
Joe?

690
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:49,598
I forgot, I promised to fill in for Dante.
He's got a thing and I have to--

691
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,310
I'll be fast, meet you soon as I'm done.
Don't do anything until I get there.

692
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,941
-You are, as ever, an inspiration.
-Thank you.

693
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,777
Well, that happened.

694
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,862
-You killed it.
-You were so great.

695
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,156
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Flawless, unimpeachable.

696
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,367
Dare I say, unironically,
mother of the year.

697
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,161
I'm so glad you were here. Both of you.

698
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,831
Thank you.

699
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,797
[inaudible dialogue]

700
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,259
What was that?

701
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,512
Are Ryan and the judge friends?

702
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,269
You were right. The system is rigged.

703
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,604
Come on, Dante. We're gonna go.

704
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,985
And as long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.

705
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,078
Hey. You good?

706
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,456
Yeah, I'm okay. What about--?

707
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,668
Oh, they're-- They're just waking up.

708
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,216
Hey.

709
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,678
We're a team, okay?

710
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,806
Till death do us part.

711
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,393
[Joe] Clearly, my plan has backfired.
My wife seems more into me than ever.

712
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:36,788
Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.

713
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:43,086
How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?

714
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,800
