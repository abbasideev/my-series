1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,394
[Joe] Previously on You:

2
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,312
Henry Forty Quinn-Goldberg.

3
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,355
[Love] We're a family.

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,690
[Joe] Now that the baby's here,

5
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,776
at least our white picket purgatory
feels logical.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,319
Hey, Natalie. Hi.

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,363
[Joe] My heart's not really in it.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,450
How could it be when you stole it?

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,453
No. Husband, father. I can't.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,913
Sorry. I'm just looking for a friend.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,458
Everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,710
Even around Sherry and her mafia?

13
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,337
[Natalie] It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:51,051
-I have this fantasy of opening a bakery.
-There's a space available.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,011
Call me if you wanna see it.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,936
Natalie. I wanted to see
the place you were talking about.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,481
[Natalie]
You can have this place up crazy fast.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,360
This place could be a raging success.
So, what do you think? [gasps]

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,154
Hey, Love. Hey, you okay?

20
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,032
Joe, I think we need to go
to couples therapy.

21
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,089
So, what brings you in?

22
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,467
[door closes]

23
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,599
-What?!
-Shh. Don't wake him up.

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,853
Love, what did you do?

25
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,278
What did you do?

26
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,446
We had a fight.

27
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,616
Obviously.
You wouldn't be here if you hadn't.

28
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,868
Yeah. I caught him cheating.

29
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,288
[Joe] Good, we're diving right in.

30
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,543
[whispering] It's okay, Henry. I won't let
anything happen to you, I promise.

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,590
[in normal voice]
Love, I told you, nothing happened.

32
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,759
If anything, she came on to me.

33
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,969
You kept a box.

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,555
I know what that means.

35
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,306
I know you.

36
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,766
So you kill her?

37
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,186
Technically, I didn't cheat.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,271
"Technically"?

39
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,482
I caught him about to cheat.
It's the same thing.

40
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,734
[Joe] The difference is
that I almost did a bad thing

41
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,570
and she did a terrible thing.

42
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,322
I can't say what she did,
so I'm the villain.

43
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,116
I'm not saying I'm blameless.

44
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,743
But she went crazy.

45
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,788
What does that mean, "crazy"?

46
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,498
[Joe] You're the shrink, that's your job.

47
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,125
She flew off the handle...

48
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,086
and broke a vase.

49
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,172
A vase.

50
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,549
-It was priceless.
-Cheap and tacky.

51
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,009
Impossible to undo.

52
00:02:56,092 --> 00:03:00,263
Don't fight, don't make it worse.
There's no telling how she'll react.

53
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,223
Okay.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,726
I broke a vase.

55
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:10,982
It's just, sometimes, I get passionate.

56
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,066
What are you doing?

57
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,236
Her phone, Love.
Her trackable, traceable phone.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,741
Did you even think about that
before you buried an ax in our neighbor?

59
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,037
No. No, I didn't plan it
like some psychopath.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,496
I-- Fuck.

61
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,417
There's this too.

62
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,169
I, um...

63
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,926
-I signed the lease for the bakery.
-You signed a lease for our crime scene?

64
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,302
Give me this.

65
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,640
I thought it would be good,
a reason I was here with her.

66
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,143
I know there's a mess to clean up,
but I couldn't leave

67
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,437
and let somebody come in here.
And now we have--

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,566
-You know, time to cover it up.
-We have no time. There's no time.

69
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,569
I'm not good at this.
You backed me into a corner,

70
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,114
-and I was trying to protect our family--
-[yelling] Let me focus!

71
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,991
-[Henry crying]
-I got it!

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,707
So you have a new baby?

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,793
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Henry.

74
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,213
-Sometimes we call him Forty.
-His name's Henry.

75
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,966
A good therapist would dig
into why our child is named

76
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,093
after her dead addict brother.

77
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,513
So, Joe, how have you found
the transition to fatherhood?

78
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,849
[Joe] A tangle of dread and failure.
Oh, and, also, murder.

79
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,101
It's great.

80
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,111
A little challenging.

81
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,155
-For both of us.
-For me more than him.

82
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,701
He's been-- and he'd admit--

83
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,539
checked out, going through the motions.

84
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,335
And it's like, "Why...?
Why isn't his heart in it?

85
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,547
And why won't he try?"

86
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,426
-I have been trying.
-You're saying you've been all in?

87
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,430
When you're only truly present
maybe 50% of the time?

88
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,724
[Joe] Textbook. She'd rather make it
about me and Henry

89
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,726
than look at her part in this.

90
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,437
Okay. Love, we need a story.

91
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,230
A reason she died.

92
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,693
She was unstable and unhappy,

93
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,904
-and she killed herself.
-With an ax?

94
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,282
She fell off a cliff
and hit her head. I don't know!

95
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,075
She needs to disappear.

96
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,994
Shh.

97
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,792
Never to be found, never to be autopsied.

98
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,421
Her phone, her iPad,
her car are impossible to hide.

99
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,090
So we need to move her...

100
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,971
things somewhere
and her body somewhere else.

101
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,514
Okay. Uh--

102
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,058
Where?

103
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,603
There's a state forest

104
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,605
30 minutes from here.

105
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,107
We bury her in the woods.

106
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,902
That worked so well with Candace.

107
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,912
I think, she's been holding
my past relationships against me.

108
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,039
Well, you do have a pattern.

109
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,707
[Joe] Don't bite, don't bite.

110
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,958
And you don't?

111
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,669
You wanna throw Candace
in my face right now?

112
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,673
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let's talk about how we handled that.

113
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,302
What did you do with her body?
Or Delilah's, for that matter.

114
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,306
-Because you have never shared.
-I told you, I took care of it.

115
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,434
And I am asking you
how you took care of it.

116
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,562
It's safer if you don't know, okay?

117
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,650
Shit! Okay.

118
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,820
You know, in L.A.,
there was this man named Jasper...

119
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,282
who came after me
because of Will Bettelheim's debts.

120
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,952
And he needed to disappear.

121
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,497
-What did you do?
-I broke him down into smaller parts.

122
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,791
-How? With, like, a saw?
-Yes.

123
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,002
Also, it was...
You know, eventually, it had to be--

124
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,256
In the end, a meat grinder was the way
to get him in a bag.

125
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,215
At Anavrin?

126
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,386
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,139
Are you fucking kidding me?

128
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,641
-I used that thing all the time!
-What is your idea?

129
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,768
Do you have a better one?
Of course you don't

130
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,146
because you murdered our neighbor
in a fit of rage.

131
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,731
No regard for the consequences.
This, today, Love, look.

132
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,275
This? You did this.

133
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,944
-You put our family in danger, Love.
-[Henry crying]

134
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,157
-Where are you going?
-To take care of the baby.

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,994
You can deal with Natalie. You cared more
about her than your own son anyway.

136
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,459
-Shh! It's okay. It's okay.
-[Joe] I was wrong, Natalie.

137
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,044
I thought you were a threat
to my marriage.

138
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,924
But the real problem
with my marriage is my fucking wife.

139
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:59,604
-So we don't know where to go from here.
-"You" don't know where to go from here.

140
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,982
He may not know either,
but when you speak in "we,"

141
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,069
you leave no room
for his individual experience or yours.

142
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,907
The "we" is codependence
masquerading as love.

143
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,908
I'm...

144
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,868
-Sorry.
-[Chandra] Don't be.

145
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,913
If you don't know
how to communicate healthily,

146
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,915
it's because it was never modeled for you.

147
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,959
[Joe] Oh, funny,
it's already "blame-the-parents o'clock."

148
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,461
I'll be honest with you.

149
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,882
I don't think this fight has anything
to do with Joe's so-called cheating.

150
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,008
[Joe] She doesn't?

151
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,927
-You don't?
-Mm-mm. Not really.

152
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,639
Do you know what it is about?

153
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,266
Not yet. But keep talking.

154
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,773
So why don't you tell me
what you went through, alone,

155
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,399
in the aftermath of the argument.

156
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,320
-Well, I--
-Actually...

157
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,156
I'd like to hear from Joe first.

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,366
[Joe] She would?

159
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,744
Maybe she can sense the inequity here.

160
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,875
Yeah, well, like I said, nothing was ever
going to happen with this woman.

161
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,836
But, after the fight,

162
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,547
I felt obligated...

163
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,801
to get rid of her for good.

164
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,094
"Obligated"?

165
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,762
Forced.

166
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,222
By your wife?

167
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,848
Yes.

168
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,435
How did that make you feel?

169
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,523
[Joe] Fuck Love. Fuck her. Fuck this.

170
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,024
Fuck whoever made these bags.

171
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,278
Where is that little perforated line?
Which end is it?

172
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,160
I should let Love take the fall for this.
But, no, she knows what I've done.

173
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,037
She knows me. Fuck marriage!

174
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
All right, Natalie.

175
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,466
This is the story of your disappearance.

176
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,218
You show my wife the bakery.

177
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,761
She signs a lease.

178
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,140
An hour later, you text your husband.

179
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,686
No emoji, no emotion,
like the rest of your texts with Matthew.

180
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,104
It's terse, all business.

181
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,940
The rental in question is
a cute cabin you manage,

182
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,901
30 minutes out on the border
of the state forest.

183
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,571
Your car, phone, iPad,

184
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,824
and all their invasive
location-tracking technologies will take

185
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,076
a scenic drive to the property.

186
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,916
Your body is headed somewhere else
but more on that in a moment.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,377
Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck my life.

188
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,339
No, no, stop. Reel it in. Think of Henry.

189
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,341
I cannot get this wrong.

190
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,509
The point is, Natalie,

191
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,138
although your stuff will make it
to the cabin, you simply disappear.

192
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,476
Your last text will be to your sister,
suggesting you are deeply unhappy,

193
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,103
leaving plenty of room for interpretation.

194
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,315
Rumor: Did you leave
your cold and distant husband?

195
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,361
Were you abducted? Assume a new identity?
Who can ever say for sure?

196
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,574
And in the event
there are traffic cameras in town...

197
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,665
So you put an end to the other woman
and you feel...

198
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,292
Emasculated.

199
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,300
[Joe] Here's the problem
my wife left us to clean up.

200
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,969
Natalie, your trackables
and your body need to part ways

201
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,972
somewhere a person would
reasonably pull over if they were alive.

202
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,143
And then, well... Then I need to find
some magically perfect place

203
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,853
to leave you forever.

204
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,235
Burying you in the woods is
the best I've got.

205
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,196
If she wanted it her way,
she should have done the hard part.

206
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,742
This isn't me though.

207
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,161
I put this behind me.

208
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,664
I changed-- You know what's funny?

209
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,249
For Love. For her.

210
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,169
Because I wanted to be good enough
for her. And look at me now.

211
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,592
I'm worried about Henry.

212
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,304
I don't recognize Love anymore.

213
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,269
I don't even recognize myself.

214
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,777
Maybe you were on to something, Natalie.

215
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,782
Kids aren't handcuffs.

216
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,706
When I'm done cleaning up Love's mess,
I am packing my bags,

217
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,251
taking Henry and getting the fuck out.

218
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,588
You were going to leave me?

219
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,591
-Are you insane?
-Uh-uh.

220
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,508
No.

221
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
You must listen.

222
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,388
I am listening, every word. How--?

223
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,141
There's a difference
between a reaction and a response.

224
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,561
The latter is thoughtful,
the former, impulsive.

225
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,189
Why does everybody think I'm impulsive?

226
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,399
Who is "everybody"?

227
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,151
[Joe] You know, she's good.

228
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,737
Uh--

229
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,822
[Chandra]
Does someone else make you feel like this?

230
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
[Dottie] Good morning. Hello?

231
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,205
Hey, Mom.

232
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,917
Hey.

233
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,087
Sleepy Forty.

234
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,131
Aren't you a little gift?

235
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,425
Why didn't you answer my calls?

236
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,885
Oh, I've been busy.

237
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,514
I signed a new lease
on a cute little bakery in town.

238
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,932
-A bakery?
-Yeah.

239
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,267
I need to head to the market.
Can you watch him?

240
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,729
He should be down for a nap.
I need to start stocking the shop.

241
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,231
Hold on. A bakery?

242
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,235
-In a town that's peak keto?
-Yeah, yeah. I will convert them.

243
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,488
I told you
that Quinn family finances were in flux.

244
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,156
We'll figure it out.

245
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,367
As in,

246
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,831
I can't guarantee
I can help you with a lease, financially.

247
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,085
Mom, that is very different
than vaguely mentioning "flux."

248
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,004
It's a three-year lease
with a huge deposit.

249
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,007
I would have told you
if you'd taken the time to ask.

250
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,510
Is this another one of your episodes?

251
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,846
"Episodes"?

252
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,516
You know, it all feels a tad impulsive.

253
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,519
So, what is it about these...

254
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,606
labels that are so hurtful?

255
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,028
Well, it's like...

256
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,447
nobody gets me.

257
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,450
Why I do things, how I do them.

258
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,205
It's like, I just wanna be
a good role model for my child.

259
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,583
And that means doing more.

260
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,502
Stay with the feeling. "Nobody gets you."

261
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:46,051
[Joe] Shit. It's hard to stay angry
when she's so-- But what's not to get?

262
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,013
She's relatable except for the part
where she's an ax murderer.

263
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,224
Is that gettable? Is it my fault
if I don't want to get that?

264
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,267
Um...

265
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,019
[chuckles]

266
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,938
I just remembered this moment at the...

267
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,275
at the store.

268
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,071
-Fuck.
-I got you.

269
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,199
-There you go. You need a...?
-Thank you.

270
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,577
-Need a hand with any of this?
-No, I'm good.

271
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,494
All right.

272
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,292
Shameless.

273
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,669
Yeah.

274
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,924
I'm a fem-gen major
if that's any comfort at all.

275
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,719
It's Feminist Gender
and Sexuality Studies.

276
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,846
So I aim to be fluent.

277
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,014
-Nice.
-Yeah.

278
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,101
I'm Theo, by the way. What's your name?

279
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,982
I'm married.
And half these groceries are for my baby.

280
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,736
Yeah, yeah, if there's one thing
I know about babies,

281
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,196
they really love yeast.

282
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,239
They just guzzle the stuff.

283
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,534
-That's for the bakery I'm opening.
-Oh, shit. Where is it?

284
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,498
-Um, off Main Street, near Town Square.
-Okay.

285
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,084
-Oh, where Sweet Dreams used to be.
-Yeah.

286
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,127
Before that, it was Curry Home for Dinner.

287
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,380
So the pun name is a requisite.

288
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,547
-Okay.
-Yeah.

289
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,967
-You're from here?
-I am, I am.

290
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,344
And you are new in town.

291
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,139
They haven't converted you
to full-time athleisure yet.

292
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,224
Congratulations.

293
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,392
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

294
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,936
Yeah, L.A. runs strong in these veins.

295
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,771
Damn, girl.

296
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,150
So you got a new town, new baby,

297
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,987
new bakery, banging body.

298
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,571
[chuckles]

299
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,657
You're just doing it all.

300
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,868
It's a tax.

301
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,794
[Chandra] What were you feeling when
this stranger paid you so much attention?

302
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,965
Guilty.

303
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,050
'Cause it felt so good.

304
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,762
And then really sad

305
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,433
'cause I didn't want that from a stranger.

306
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,309
I wanted that from my husband.

307
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,439
[Joe] And just like that,
she's the victim again. Masterful.

308
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,399
How does that sit with you?

309
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,278
I'm flattered.

310
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,447
[Chandra] Mm.

311
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,074
Your face tells a different story.

312
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,452
If anything, you seem repulsed.

313
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,203
[Joe] Dumb, back-stabbing face.

314
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,872
No. What--? No.

315
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:24,960
No, no, no. Look, I haven't been
as present as I would like...

316
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,421
lately.

317
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,214
Parenthood is an adjustment.

318
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,134
But I'm...

319
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,013
-I'm here, right?
-[Chandra] True.

320
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,515
Maybe being here is already
a radical concession,

321
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,893
given you were on the verge
of leaving for good.

322
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,521
So why didn't you?

323
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,315
Leave her?

324
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,526
[ominous music playing]

325
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,490
[Joe] Maybe I'll take Henry some place
like this lovely rental cabin of yours.

326
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,033
Pretty, quiet.

327
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,081
You could have helped me vanish, Natalie.
But now... it's time to vanish you.

328
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,666
Your husband won't suspect
you're missing for a day.

329
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,002
All that remains is
a cryptic text to your sister,

330
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,341
then I gotta hike ten miserable miles,
catch a ride home and start packing.

331
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,343
Oh, what's this?

332
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,680
"Tell me I shouldn't fuck
the boring neighbor"?

333
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,642
"Boring neighbor"?

334
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,313
Is that all I was to you?

335
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,982
Is that all you were?

336
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,196
A restless housewife? A stereotype?
Maybe Love was right about you.

337
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,785
No, no, no. She had no right to kill you.
Still, things could've gotten messy fast.

338
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,789
Maybe I would've made a mess.
Maybe Love was right. No, she wasn't.

339
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,625
-Shit.
-[Chandra] It's not a trick question.

340
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,294
Why didn't you run?

341
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,050
Well, because...

342
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,142
I couldn't convince myself
that Henry would be better off.

343
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,478
He needs both of us.

344
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,859
So you stayed for the child,
not for your wife.

345
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,822
[alarm beeps]

346
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,741
Unfortunately, that's our time for today.

347
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,243
I'm giving you homework.

348
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,539
"How to talk."

349
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,794
The reflective listening exercise will
help structure difficult conversations.

350
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,714
Slow down, respond...

351
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,675
-instead of react.
-[Joe] That's Love's homework.

352
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,428
Mine is to prevent her
from murdering this therapist.

353
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,222
[Chandra] And I'd like to see you
as soon as possible,

354
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,185
given we are in a bit
of a triage situation.

355
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,686
Is it that bad?

356
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,647
You want me to tell you
whether or not you should be together.

357
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,487
The truth is, the easiest thing is
to end this marriage.

358
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,824
Either one of you have
the power to do it tonight.

359
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,828
You must choose to stay together
every minute from now until death,

360
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,538
and that takes a lot of will

361
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,041
and something both of you are willing
to fight for.

362
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,086
So far, I've only heard you fight
to be right.

363
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,964
You need a deeper purpose.

364
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,926
[Joe] Henry. If nothing else, Love and I--

365
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,802
And don't say "Henry."

366
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,639
If children were enough reason
to stay married,

367
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,016
we'd have no divorced parents.

368
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:26,975
[Joe] Shit.

369
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,818
What's the only thing worse
than couples therapy?

370
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,695
Coming home afterward.

371
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,409
Dr. Chandra's "How to talk" worksheet is
mostly about how to listen,

372
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,995
which may be useful if we ever talk again.

373
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,832
Okay, so Sherry's wedding cake
was lemon-raspberry.

374
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,462
So I think that gluten-free, sugar-free,

375
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,716
fucking happiness-free cupcakes,
that should be a safe bet.

376
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,303
Andrew and Jackson's kid's party.

377
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,473
We're still going to that?
Don't you think that...?

378
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,767
Wait. Do you have some packing
and running to do?

379
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,983
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me try it again. I'm sorry.

380
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,195
[Love clearing throat]

381
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,576
What I'm hearing is that you think

382
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,997
that Natalie and us should be
the only people

383
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,001
who mysteriously
don't attend today's party.

384
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,711
[Joe] Not better.

385
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
-That's not what I'm saying.
-No?

386
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,134
What I'm hearing is that you would
really like some alone time.

387
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,387
So I'm gonna go take Henry
and let you work in peace.

388
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,058
Not what I said.

389
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,977
[upbeat electronic music playing]

390
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,950
You two again.

391
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,493
[Joe] Yes, us again.

392
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,329
There you go.

393
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,165
That was a quick read.

394
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,876
Need me to find another beautiful woman
to recommend the next one?

395
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,544
I already found one.

396
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,256
I was hoping you could show me
the rare books section.

397
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,175
What makes you think we have one?

398
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,427
[Joe] A dumbwaiter indicates a basement

399
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,305
where a mole-rat person looks after
the valuable books.

400
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,639
But I'm guessing...

401
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,683
We don't have anyone down there right now.

402
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,809
Okay, yeah.

403
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,437
Well, maybe you could escort us.

404
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,105
We'll be very quick.

405
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,316
I promise.

406
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,117
And here we are.

407
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,996
[Joe] Yikes. These poor books.

408
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,540
You looking for anything specific?

409
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,753
You know what,
I think I'll know it when I see it.

410
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,046
Mind if I take a look?

411
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,381
-Please.
-Okay.

412
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,848
I thought you said
no one worked down here.

413
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,394
Oh, I do, sometimes.

414
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,396
When it's slow upstairs.

415
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,356
[Joe] Interesting. Keep her talking.

416
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,109
So... you're an artist.

417
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm a librarian who draws.

418
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,571
[Joe] Looks like more than that to me.

419
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,033
Anything other
than Victorian science books down here?

420
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,368
Okay, nosy.

421
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,037
I illustrate books sometimes.

422
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,332
-It's just a side hustle though.
-Bingo.

423
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,673
So is there anywhere that I can see
your work, like online maybe or...?

424
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,299
-Why?
-[Henry crying]

425
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,470
-You write a kids' book?
-No, I'm just a connoisseur.

426
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,388
Here we go.

427
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,476
Wildflowers of New York.

428
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:02,065
Do you need a 100-year-old gardening book
instead of a new one upstairs?

429
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,943
Nothing beats the classics.
I can have this back in a few days.

430
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,279
No. You're not supposed
to take these ones home.

431
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,072
Okay. I can read it upstairs.

432
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,992
I think he should calm down
in just a bit. Right, Henry?

433
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,702
That's okay. Just take it.

434
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,830
-Thank you, thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

435
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,665
[Joe] Glad someone's got my back.

436
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,753
Less than ideal to steal, of course.

437
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,507
But Ellie needs cash,
and I can't touch Quinn funds

438
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,343
for fear of them finding out where she is.

439
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,304
[pop music playing]

440
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,057
And let's be honest,
it feels good to fix something.

441
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,145
Especially when everything else feels
so unfixable.

442
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,231
Oh, shit. I knew it, we're late.

443
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,400
[Joe] What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?

444
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,903
-Is this really the life I want?
-Hi.

445
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,280
-Welcome.
-The only thing worse than a kid's party

446
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,448
is a rich kid's party.

447
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,793
[woman] A little bit to the right.

448
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,004
One more.

449
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,631
Oh, you're early.

450
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,508
Hi. Yeah, I--

451
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,052
-We thought that...
-Oh, it's fine. Fine.

452
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,137
Most of the gang's here to help set up.

453
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,181
Um...

454
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,060
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna put these somewhere.

455
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,647
Hey, boys! Look who's here.

456
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,776
-Hey!
-Yo, Joe! Let's get you drunk!

457
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,028
Stop. But seriously...

458
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,407
-how drunk do you wanna be for this?
-Love!

459
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,618
-We didn't think we'd see you today.
-Oh.

460
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,288
-You left in such a hurry the other night.
-Oh, yeah, I'm sorry for ghosting.

461
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,500
My mom was watching the baby,
and Dottie has an expiration time.

462
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,502
Alcohol? Pills?

463
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,257
It's no judgment. I could only imagine
what she's been through. Oh!

464
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,678
I could cry right now.
Being a mom of twins...

465
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,723
Losing one would be like... losing both.

466
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,768
I made cupcakes.

467
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,520
-You made those?
-Gorgeous.

468
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:08,358
Yes. I am also opening a bakery.
A cute little spot on Main Street.

469
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,443
I love that.

470
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
So brave.

471
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,323
You've heard
that spot hasn't had much success,

472
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,242
-but it's never had you, mama.
-Yeah.

473
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,287
I was hoping you lovelies would be
my guinea pigs.

474
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,377
Don't worry, they're organic
and, like, everything-free.

475
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,879
They're lemon-raspberry.

476
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:34,926
You know, I'm not really a fan
of lemon or raspberry.

477
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,431
-Already hit my macro.
-I'm fasting.

478
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,599
Oh!

479
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,892
We should get our kids in their costumes.

480
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
[Cary] Screw your liver.

481
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,150
Seventy percent of G-clearance happens
in the peripheral tissue.

482
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,321
[Joe] This is what fun looks like
in Madre Linda: glorified productivity.

483
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,365
I want the best for my son.
No denying, this beats a group home,

484
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,201
but there's gotta be
a third bowl of porridge.

485
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,828
Bottom line, 45-minute orgasm.

486
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,456
-No way.
-Sick. I'll invest.

487
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,583
[Joe] Things I've learned
in the past ten minutes:

488
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:11,379
ejaculating too much can deplete focus,
so Cary patented "injaculating."

489
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,633
Sherry started nicknaming me
"The Stallion."

490
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,677
[Joe] And Gil is only
a hair less outsider than me.

491
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:22,015
Judging by the gasps he gives
every time Cary says the word "ejaculate,"

492
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,309
I'd guess that Gil waited till marriage.

493
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,062
-Daddy! Daddy!
-[Joe] Thank you, tiny intruder.

494
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,230
Hey. Having fun?
I want you to meet someone.

495
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,067
This is Joe. Joe, this is Zoe. Zoe, Joe.

496
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,362
I've seen you at the library.
I read to the kids there.

497
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,155
You and Henry should join. It's fun.

498
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,531
-We can carpool.
-Maybe.

499
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,868
Rather lose another finger than carpool
with Mormon Neville Longbottom.

500
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,038
So far, nothing about this place
worth fighting for.

501
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,166
-[Sherry] Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh. Sherry's siren song.

502
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,251
Duty calls, men.

503
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,129
[Sherry] Don't eat sugar! Honey, no!

504
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,006
Go ahead. I can watch the little guy.

505
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,841
Yeah? Okay. Thank you.

506
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,010
-Sure, no problem.
-[Joe] Nice guy.

507
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,721
Maybe I'm still looking
for reasons to run.

508
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,766
Get that-- No, baby. Oh, baby girl, no!

509
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,561
You have completely spiked
their blood sugar, Love.

510
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,065
-No, they're sugar-free.
-There's sugar in raspberries.

511
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,068
-We don't let them eat fruit. Come on.
-Oh.

512
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,821
Let's go, babies. This way.

513
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,782
Cary, I am so sorry.

514
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,867
That's fine. They're kids.

515
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,831
Hey, I'll give the wife
a little you-know-what later,

516
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,792
and she'll just lose all memory of this.

517
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,338
Don't worry. I got the twins wearing
those Vital Rings of Matthew's.

518
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,423
[Joe] Matthew...

519
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,592
See?

520
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,220
Heart rates and blood sugar,
totally normal.

521
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,598
Does this have GPS?

522
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,351
Oh, yeah. Leave it to Matthew.

523
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,771
He could give a shit about your health,
he's just horny for the data.

524
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,983
It's pretty spotty,
but it gives you the general idea.

525
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,069
-We all wear them.
-[Joe] No.

526
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,696
No, no.

527
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,950
If Matthew has access to Natalie's ring,
he'll be able to see exactly where she is.

528
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,036
Do you think they could see
that her heart stopped?

529
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,122
-I didn't invent the fucking ring.
-[Matthew] Stop!

530
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,333
Hey. Hey, man.

531
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,754
No, listen to me.
We need to stop production, then.

532
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,465
[Joe] He hasn't put it together yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

533
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,886
Natalie's been gone over 24 hours.
Our window is rapidly closing.

534
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,347
[dramatic music playing]

535
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,691
-What? Are you bringing him?
-Wanna leave him in the car?

536
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,485
That's Bad Parenting 101.

537
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,032
Witnessing us dig up a body isn't?

538
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:48,077
He has barely any depth perception,
which you should know.

539
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:54,709
What I'm hearing is, even as I am doing
everything in my power to save my child,

540
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,003
my parenting skills aren't up
to your standards.

541
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,838
Is this important right now?

542
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,145
Oh, fuck!

543
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,651
Why does she look like that?

544
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,487
I had to remove her teeth.

545
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,659
Right. Dental records. Yeah.

546
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,412
Where did you put them?

547
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,542
The teeth? Don't wanna find them
in a hidey-hole in my house.

548
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,586
You won't. It's safer if you don't know.

549
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,841
[grunting]

550
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,516
-What?
-Might want to wait in the car with Henry.

551
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,726
I can handle it. Just fucking do it.

552
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,603
[Joe] We'll see.

553
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,939
[bones cracking]

554
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,078
It's cracked. Maybe that's good.

555
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,415
Could've just broken when--
In the bakery when she fell.

556
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,541
But what if it didn't?

557
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,670
Still have to move it.
The body can't be where the ring died.

558
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,130
-So just...
-Yeah.

559
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,761
[thunder crashing]

560
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,314
[breathing heavily]

561
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,774
[Henry coos]

562
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,615
I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

563
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,577
What now?

564
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,496
I know where to go.

565
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,843
You said we needed a permanent solution.
We're on the edge of town.

566
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,887
They're pouring a foundation tomorrow.

567
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,557
Under a slab of cement is permanent.

568
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,226
-How did you know we'd rebury her?
-I didn't.

569
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,481
I drove past it yesterday,
so I looked into it. A backup plan.

570
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,526
How many of those do you have?

571
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,489
Do you just drive around
making mental notes

572
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,784
of good places to disappear people?

573
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,703
Considering who I'm married to, yeah.

574
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,081
I kind of have to.

575
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,666
Oh, I'm the psycho.

576
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,086
How did you get rid of her so fast?
How did you know where to go?

577
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,839
-What were you planning for?
-What are you insinuating?

578
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,727
Why is she doing this now?
We have a body to take care of.

579
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,563
If this is a partnership,
I'm better off alone.

580
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,984
-Love?
-[yelling] Why don't you love me anymore?!

581
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,612
-You know why, you just won't say it.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,824
You had a hook to my throat.
And then I said I was pregnant.

583
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,494
And then we just went on
and pretended like it didn't happen.

584
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,456
No, no, no, we didn't!
It was a bad moment. For both of us.

585
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,918
-It was a bad moment a lifetime ago.
-Fuck you. Fuck you.

586
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,587
You act all pure and noble,

587
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,757
like you have reasons
for what you do when you do it.

588
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,968
But when I do it, I'm crazy, right?

589
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,012
I'm some manic nutjob.

590
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,388
"But, oh, wait! Oh, wait!

591
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,433
She's a mom now,
I guess I can't slit her throat."

592
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,981
He... is the only reason I'm alive.

593
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,485
How do you think that makes me feel?
I can't trust you.

594
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,780
I can't trust you either!

595
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,323
I was trying to--

596
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,535
Yes, yes. Yes, I did things.

597
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,707
But I've worked hard to be better
and I am not that person anymore.

598
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,624
But now,

599
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,795
I will be burying bodies
until I'm 70 years old!

600
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,008
Because if I'm not 100% into you
all of the time,

601
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,386
you will keep killing people!

602
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,390
If I'm not enough for you, you'll kill me.

603
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,267
You said that out loud?

604
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,438
I want you to listen closely.

605
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,942
Fifty percent of my married clients want
to kill each other.

606
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,069
It's normal.

607
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,112
And here's the better news,

608
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,198
neither one of you is gonna kill
your spouse.

609
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,326
You're many things,
but you are not murderers.

610
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,165
The intensity here is a very good sign.

611
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,044
You're not fighting to be right,
you're fighting for your lives.

612
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,338
Deeper. Right?

613
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,466
-[Joe] Scarier.
-Joe.

614
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,887
Can you think of any times
when you felt as violent as you did

615
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,639
toward Love in your fight?

616
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,018
A few.

617
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,062
No, I'm pregnant!

618
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,232
I'm not a violent person.

619
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,986
What if sometimes you are?
What if that's normal?

620
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,284
Stop. Stop!

621
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,622
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

622
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,165
[Chandra] I believe you.

623
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,544
So, what's the feeling under the rage?

624
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,465
Fear.

625
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,425
Fear that...?

626
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
Joe, stay with the violent thoughts.

627
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,519
You're broken. I could never love you.

628
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,854
You're crazy!

629
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,815
What did you do? What did you do?

630
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,401
If someone...

631
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,195
sees me...

632
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,990
-Why does she look like that?
-I had to remove her teeth.

633
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,576
If someone sees the real me...

634
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,664
they'll go away.

635
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,541
For good.

636
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,053
What about you, Love?

637
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,642
When else have you felt the way
that Joe makes you feel?

638
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,194
When I feel...

639
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,907
-protective.
-What are you fighting to protect?

640
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,160
-My family.
-Why specifically family?

641
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,828
That's what you do.

642
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,208
What do you get from your family?

643
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,584
I don't know.

644
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,840
A family is supposed to...

645
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,760
love you unconditionally.

646
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,720
Why is that so important?

647
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,973
Why does love have to be unconditional?

648
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,354
Because if anyone...

649
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,399
saw...

650
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:22,823
how ugly I can be...

651
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,329
They'll go away for good.

652
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,957
[pensive music playing]

653
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,930
Fair to say one of the things
you have in common

654
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:52,311
is fear of abandonment so deep,
it feels downright kill-or-be-killed.

655
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,355
Metaphorically speaking.

656
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,774
When our patterns line up like this,

657
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,111
it's very, very hard
to see the other person

658
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,322
because it's dangerously close
to looking in a mirror.

659
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:08,119
[Joe] We're talking about
the worst things, so why do I feel relief?

660
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,204
So how are we, um--

661
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,331
I'm sorry. Joe and I.

662
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,459
--supposed to make this work?

663
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,005
That's the perfect word.

664
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,424
"Work." Because that's what it takes.

665
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,468
Let go of unconditional.
There's no such thing.

666
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,305
There's agreeing
to show up the best we can.

667
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,849
In the best marriages,

668
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,810
each partner challenges the other
every day

669
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,979
to be a better version of themselves.

670
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,315
-Sounds like a lot of fighting.
-Sure.

671
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,567
But is all fighting bad?

672
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,362
Maybe this isn't two opponents in a ring.

673
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,782
Maybe this is two on the same team

674
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,243
fighting for the same thing.

675
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,205
That sounds good.

676
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,711
Having someone on my... team.

677
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,797
Yeah.

678
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,175
Yeah, that sounds nice.

679
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,764
[Chandra] There you go.

680
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,811
You know what else
they don't tell you about teammates?

681
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,521
The sex is better.

682
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,692
Like, "Don't bother to describe it
to your unmarried friends" better.

683
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,487
