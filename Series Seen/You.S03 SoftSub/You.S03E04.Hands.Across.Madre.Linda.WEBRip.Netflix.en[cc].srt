1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,394
[Joe] Previously on You:

2
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,064
[Goodwin] It's been three days
since the disappearance of Natalie Engler.

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,858
-Falco.
-We found the ring.

4
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,859
Okay.

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,652
Love, this is my son, Theo.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,987
Didn't know you had a son.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,949
I'm still very unclear
as to why you decided to volunteer here.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,243
I'm at the hospital.
Henry has the measles.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,829
-Who do you think it was?
-Not closed yet, are you?

10
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,248
Can't tell you
how sorry we are for exposing Henry.

11
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
We hope you won't hold it against us.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,543
-Hey, Gil.
-Yep?

13
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,403
[Joe]
Well, this came sooner than expected.

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,406
The proverbial paint is hardly dry.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,908
Breathing.

16
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:19,704
It's more than I can say for Natalie.
Meaning, you did the right thing.

17
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,168
Controlled your impulses.

18
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,007
So I won't be frustrated
with you, Love. No.

19
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,217
This is growth,

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,386
and it's important I show you
I recognize it--

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,388
No. Appreciate it.

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,309
I'll set aside the fact that we're using
our son's baby monitor as surveillance.

23
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,686
It's twisted but smart.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,938
[Gil groaning]

25
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,399
[Joe] Hey, Gil. Hey, buddy.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,819
Hey there.

27
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,779
Hey.

28
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,030
She hit me.

29
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,407
[groaning]

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,325
I'm so sorry.

31
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,410
"Slipped and hit your head" is
off the table.

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,287
Your wife. She knocked me out.

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,081
[Joe] Can't say it was a shock.

34
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,332
I was shocked.

35
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,502
I said, "Gil? Nice guy Gil?"

36
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,671
'Course she told me what you said.

37
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:15,218
Not that it justified what she did.
The thing is, if you could have seen...

38
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,013
what she went through
in the hospital with our baby...

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,640
Here.

40
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,065
Still, she should not have done this.

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,316
That's for sure.

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,241
It's a proofing room.
Something about temperature and humidity.

43
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,954
Keeps the dough from getting a tough skin.
I'm not sure I understand any of it.

44
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,290
That's Margaret with her gardening.

45
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,626
Seeds and soil pH and...

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,129
[Joe] Friendly chatter's
a reflex with this guy.

47
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,175
You may have assaulted the one person
who might give us a pass for this.

48
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,760
Love and I are very embarrassed.

49
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,346
Is there any chance
we could keep this between us?

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,850
We will not tell a soul
how you recklessly endangered our son.

51
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,853
-I don't know I would put it like that.
-No? How?

52
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,690
Well, it's just-- No judgment.

53
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,277
But to dose an infant
with chemicals we know nothing about?

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,487
-I mean, I call that reckless.
-Hmm.

55
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,158
Actually, your son has naturally
gained immunity, so...

56
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,493
I'd say it was beneficial.

57
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,661
[knuckles cracking]

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,333
You know what? I'm sorry.

59
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,502
-I'm sorry, I get carried away.
-No, no, no.

60
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,048
You might be right, yeah.

61
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,885
-Our child is fine.
-Yeah.

62
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,597
Here.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,022
Here, let me help you up.

64
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,067
[Gil grunts]

65
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,068
Ooh.

66
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,242
So, what do you say, bygones?

67
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,791
Okay.

68
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,086
Sure. Bygones.

69
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,548
[Joe] He's lying.

70
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,926
-Are you absolutely sure?
-[Gil] I'm cool!

71
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,011
I'm cool. Let me out, please?

72
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,138
No doubt. He'll go straight to the police.

73
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,766
-Fuck.
-Guys, let's be grown-ups about this!

74
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,810
-Now what?
-Come on!

75
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,574
Here we go. Coming in hot, Henry. Hey.

76
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:48,162
[sputtering] Got to bank to the left.
Here. Open. There we go.

77
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,291
Peek in our window,
you see your typical suburban family

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,792
having a typical morning.

79
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,711
You know, it can be blissful...

80
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,922
watching our son discover
the pleasures of sweet potatoes.

81
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,090
All I really need.

82
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,425
I did have a thought.

83
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
Mutually-assured destruction.

84
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,099
Get something that he doesn't want
anyone else to know about

85
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,143
and he can't expose us.

86
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,106
-He opens his mouth, we open ours.
-Worked for me once before.

87
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,108
It would have, Benji.

88
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,320
-He may look like a choirboy...
-So did Dahmer.

89
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,378
[Joe] A plan in place,
a Monday's worth of returns.

90
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,924
I got lots of time to learn what Gil's
hiding behind the Mr. Rogers persona.

91
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,472
Okay. All right. So Google
out of my boss's eagle-eyeline.

92
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,641
Kids are gonna commit hara-kiri.

93
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,144
No child sacrifice in the library, please.

94
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,855
Gil is MIA. He was our reader today,

95
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,274
and I told Lansing
I'd run the boys to the dentist.

96
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,361
-[Joe] He did not just say "Gil."
-That's so not like Gil.

97
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,238
He's their favorite. Man's a saint.

98
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,658
[Joe] Except for that one dark thing
about him that Dante knows?

99
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,661
You know better than that.
Not even the saints were saints.

100
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,705
Hey, sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.

101
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,624
-I could read to the kids.
-I've got it.

102
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,708
Okay.

103
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,005
Joe Goldberg? Hi.
Did I know you work here?

104
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,549
[Joe] Did I know you had
your breasts enhanced in 2017?

105
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,344
Vlogged your recovery
from Adderall addiction?

106
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,679
Brother's a roadie
for 5 Seconds of Summer?

107
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,889
Cool to post this?

108
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,812
[Gil over phone] This is stupid!

109
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,731
Hey, hello? Hey!

110
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,943
-Hey, you--
-I could have one of everything.

111
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,195
Well, I wouldn't tell.

112
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,030
But my ass would.

113
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,783
God, I envy you, Love.

114
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,369
I have so many photo shoots,
next thing you know,

115
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,913
people will be calling me "brave"
and then unfollowing

116
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,666
'cause I'm no longer aspirational.
[chuckles]

117
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,959
Mind if I post this?

118
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh.

119
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,379
Perfect. Okay, ciao.

120
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,172
Ciao.

121
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,842
[door opens, then bells chiming]

122
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,221
-Fuck.
-[Joe] Love, listen.

123
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,890
[Love] That ring, it was supposed
to look like she left it there,

124
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,476
then moved on,
but of course they want to look there.

125
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,397
-What if we missed something else?
-We control what we can.

126
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,898
We keep up appearances.

127
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,235
We volunteer to help with the search.

128
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,030
-God.
-It's gonna be okay.

129
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,241
Okay.

130
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,910
I'll see you at home.

131
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,459
[Joe] A man in a cage is a problem.

132
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,711
Few hundred citizens combing the woods

133
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,880
where we buried
and exhumed Natalie Engler?

134
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,381
Full-stop crisis.

135
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,388
[Theo]
I don't understand why I would go to this!

136
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,099
-[Matthew] Theo, can you be reasonable?
-You can't make me volunteer!

137
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,770
-That's implied in the word "volunteer"--
-Theo! Keep your voice down.

138
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,315
Dad, they're making you look pathetic.

139
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,859
I am not going.

140
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,905
When you're ready to talk like a person
above the age of 6, I'll be inside.

141
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,919
Hey, was the idea to be so loud,
the whole neighborhood could hear?

142
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,006
'Cause that was gauche.
You sounded like a brat.

143
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,509
You little peeping Tom. You spying on me?

144
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,760
[Love chuckles]

145
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,095
What's up with all the dad theatrics?

146
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,014
Um...

147
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,851
So, apparently, Sherry Conrad
and her creepy little squad

148
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,064
are teaming up with the cops
to go search some state park

149
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,984
to, like, I don't know,
find Natalie out there stacking rocks?

150
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,028
You don't want to join?

151
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,657
I've been waiting
for this opportunity to join a cabal

152
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,660
of soulless, bulimic yoga moms.
I think it's my calling.

153
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,628
They're convinced that he killed her.

154
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,091
I don't want him helping
the villagers sharpen their pitchforks.

155
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:17,223
You should go. Optics are a thing.
If you don't go, both of you look bad.

156
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,642
Hey, hey, hey.

157
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,813
I will be your search buddy. Hmm?

158
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,939
[gasps]

159
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,401
Tie my shoes and everything?

160
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,278
If necessary.

161
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,490
Brat.

162
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,910
Hey, you should get this fixed by the way.

163
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,043
[Joe] This "Hands Across
Madre Linda" exercise in the woods

164
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,170
has me dangerously distracted.

165
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,593
What if we did leave something
for John and Betty Volunteer to find?

166
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,305
But we weren't careless, were we?

167
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,473
Focus! One thing at a time.

168
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,103
Need to find Gil's fatal flaw.

169
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,024
"Geology rocks." "Schist happens."

170
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,444
If I've mined anything, it's that
"Rock Star" Professor Gil Brigham

171
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,279
has a taste for geologist humor.

172
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,032
Once taught at Burgess College
in Columbus, Ohio.

173
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,076
Left in his second year. In October. Hmm.

174
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
It's abrupt.

175
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,913
Did he transgress with a co-ed?

176
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,666
"Sophomore Burgess student
victim of campus attack."

177
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,335
Could it be...?

178
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,420
Hmm.

179
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,925
Four hours in
and the only fault I can find

180
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,719
is Gil's sense of humor.

181
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,889
Spotless academic career, church,
a dedication to his kids so deep

182
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,850
he may be the inspiration
for those World's Greatest Dad mugs.

183
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,977
Never misses a game, a birthday--

184
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,063
Look, he volunteers
at the children's ward--

185
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,856
And shit! The library.

186
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,441
Better account for today.

187
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:55,613
Sorry to miss today. A little work crisis.

188
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,990
Sorry to disappoint the kids.

189
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,825
-[Marienne] Who are we stalking?
-Hey.

190
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,411
-No, no, I'm just--
-You seen Peer Gynt?

191
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,580
[Joe] Yes. In that I stole it for Ellie.

192
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,958
Yeah, I may have taken it home for a read.

193
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,420
You took a 2500-dollar book
that isn't supposed to leave?

194
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,215
You know how when you know a rule exists,

195
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,550
but you don't think it applies to you

196
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
because you're quick
and careful, and you work here.

197
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,015
For those of us who didn't grow up
with first editions for coasters--

198
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,726
I'm sorry,
you think that I come from money?

199
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,854
Look what you've done to me, Love.
I smell like the rich now.

200
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,356
Just let me say this.

201
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,983
There were no first editions
on the shelves growing up

202
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,152
because there were no... shelves.

203
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,863
-Right. You were poor.
-Practically homeless.

204
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,492
A bookstore owner took me in
and let me work for free,

205
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,120
and I slept in a cage in his basement.

206
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,790
No, wait. Marienne, hang on.
Wait, I'm sorry.

207
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,335
I'm sorry. Stop. That crossed the line.
It was an exaggeration.

208
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,671
We straddled the poverty line
my entire childhood,

209
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:57,049
and I escaped with books.

210
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,884
I learned all about them,

211
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,637
like you wanna know everything
about that one beautiful thing.

212
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,391
It saves your miserable life.

213
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,310
So I...

214
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,273
I misjudged a little, maybe.

215
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,735
Generally, my favorite apologies
are stiff and grudging...

216
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,112
Fair.

217
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,864
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,031
Ah...

219
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,996
And I guess I might have
to like you after all, Goldberg.

220
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,373
-Perish the thought.
-Hmm.

221
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,377
Since we're friends now,
what else did you take?

222
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,504
[Joe] A Dickens, a Shelley,
a signed early Strand.

223
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,672
-Nothing.
-Mm-hm.

224
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,384
Make sure that's still true
when I look real hard tomorrow.

225
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,302
Okay?

226
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,314
-[Gil] Thought we had a deal!
-We did. I'm sorry.

227
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,109
You know, you can't keep me in here
like some animal.

228
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,739
People know that I was coming here.
So you can let me out or the police can.

229
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,284
-When they come looking--
-No one's gonna save you. We--

230
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,538
We already made excuses on your behalf.

231
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,332
Uh...

232
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,502
I'm sorry, Gil.
I want to let you out, man.

233
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,712
I won't tell a soul.

234
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,838
I promise.

235
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,925
I told you, we can keep this between us.

236
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,262
Say...

237
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,390
we knew something about you.

238
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,938
Something you really don't want
anyone to know.

239
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,150
Right, I see.

240
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,861
Okay, I keep your secret, you keep mine.

241
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,865
And this time,
you'll keep your end of the deal?

242
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,825
Yes.

243
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,702
Okay. Okay.

244
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,957
Just-- Give me a minute to think.

245
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,211
I got it!

246
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,963
Okay, listen.

247
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:06,011
Couple years back, our church group went
to a festival for Christ in Vegas.

248
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,473
[Joe] Christ? Vegas?
Strong starter ingredients.

249
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,810
We raised funds for the Santoses,

250
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,937
who'd lost their home to a fire.

251
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,817
And now, there's this woman, Cheryl.

252
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,361
[Joe] Christ. Vegas. Cheryl.

253
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,115
Real, you know, fun-lover.
You know the type.

254
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,535
Anyway, everyone else had gone to bed,

255
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,497
but she and I have
a little more in our tanks.

256
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,456
So...

257
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,045
So we take the 600 dollars
that we'd raised, and...

258
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,757
[Joe] A room with a pile of blow
and a dominatrix dressed as a nun.

259
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,593
Why didn't I start here this morning?

260
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,511
We put it all on red.

261
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,892
And lost.

262
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,562
That sucks. Then what?

263
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,190
Then we had to recoup it
from our own savings that Monday.

264
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,029
-That's it?
-"That's it?"

265
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:10,159
-We gambled and lost the Santoses' money.
-And you returned it-- It was a Monday?

266
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah, but we lied.

267
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,913
You know, we were selfish.

268
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,624
If people knew that, are you kidding me?

269
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,211
Okay.

270
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,214
Okay, fine. I slept with her.

271
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,216
I did.

272
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,303
Real rough-style too.

273
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,017
-Can you define "rough style"?
-You know, when...

274
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,978
I'm trying to give you something.

275
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
-Got to do better, Gil.
-Fuck!

276
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,901
Fuck.

277
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,405
So I managed to rolling-pin
the only saint in Madre Linda?

278
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,032
Not even the saints are saints.

279
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,786
But, look, I-- I don't know.

280
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,287
My mom's taking Henry tomorrow.

281
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,790
-With everything...
-It's a good idea.

282
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,833
[reporter on TV]
"Committee to Find Natalie Engler"

283
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,087
is organizing a search party in
Redwood State Park, which is Natalie's...

284
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,588
Better give her a frozen one.

285
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,133
In case of an earthquake, right? Or...

286
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,678
we're taken in for questioning.

287
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,347
Joe?

288
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,227
-Tell me not to panic.
-There's nothing for them to find.

289
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,353
What if they do?

290
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,316
What if they get a search warrant
or they start looking around?

291
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,151
"What's in this basement?"

292
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,321
[Joe] Why is it feeling
like this has become my fault?

293
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,408
[boy] It's your fault
your mommy left you here, Goldberg.

294
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,537
We need to get rid of Gil.

295
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,789
We can't have this hanging over our heads.

296
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,707
I know.

297
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,128
Okay, so we built the cage
so that we could stop and think.

298
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,588
What if we've done that and now...?

299
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,761
-What? And now what?
-[boy] What you gonna do, Goldberg?

300
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,180
He's gonna cry.

301
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,766
Just like he cries for his mommy
in bed very night.

302
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,726
[boys laughing]

303
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,186
We didn't want... to do this.

304
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,189
-We did this to protect our family.
-[Sandy] It had to be done.

305
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,568
You were protecting me.
You're a good boy, Joey.

306
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,070
What if the only option is for Gil to--?

307
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,657
[boy] She's not coming for you.

308
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,826
No one is coming to save you.

309
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,578
Yeah.

310
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,581
Give me a better idea.

311
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,209
-I can't believe you're saying this.
-I'm just asking questions.

312
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,878
You're saying, "I don't know."

313
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,297
You hit him and put him in a cage
when we could've--

314
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,923
-Sued him.
-The cage was your idea.

315
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,593
-No, no, no. We are not going to--
-How--?

316
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,971
You are not making me kill anyone!

317
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,768
We are not doing that to our son.

318
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,333
I shouldn't.

319
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,462
Not exactly getting my run in down here.

320
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,718
Used to be my son Alan and I
got out there every morning.

321
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,679
Before he went off to Dartmouth.

322
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,893
-He'd get a kick out of this.
-He would?

323
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,729
Come on. His pops knocked down a peg?

324
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,023
You know...

325
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,692
sons and their fathers.

326
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,736
Yeah, I'm new to it.

327
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,697
You kidding?
This idea that you have to mold them

328
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,991
into a good strong man...

329
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,284
How'd you?

330
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,245
Mm.

331
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,707
I came to realize it's a lot simpler
than I was making it.

332
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,459
Here's what you do as a parent:

333
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,588
You keep them healthy and safe
and be a good person.

334
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,678
That's it. Protect, be good,
get out of the way.

335
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,471
To be honest, I'm jealous.

336
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,890
You have it all ahead of you.

337
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,609
Hey, um...

338
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,115
whatever happens here,
I just hope I get to see them again.

339
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:28,292
...hoping we can buy another 30 acres
of this wonderful property on the coast

340
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,837
that apparently gets
this great fog Pinot thrives in.

341
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,257
Sweetie, hand me
those fleece-y p.j.'s in case it's cold.

342
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,760
Butt Paste. He's been a bit red lately.
So I'm gonna...

343
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,765
Worried?
If you think this vineyard business

344
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,560
is going to jeopardize the bakery,
it's the opposite.

345
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:51,315
-This is how empires are born.
-Yeah, it's actually not that. I, um...

346
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,904
Does Dad still have that guy Cy?

347
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,616
Probably has that little snake digging
into me right now.

348
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,700
Why, what's up?

349
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,953
I know it was something.

350
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,122
Oh, it's no big. I just...

351
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,210
I got a weird vibe from the guy
I rent the bakery from.

352
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,630
I wanna make sure he's legit.
I don't want to put in all of this work

353
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,257
just to have the property seized
by the IRS.

354
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,509
I'll get you his number.

355
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,905
I did something you're not gonna
be totally... psyched about.

356
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:42,991
Try me.

357
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,662
My mom...

358
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,250
gave me a number for a guy
that my dad uses to look into people.

359
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,003
You involved your family?

360
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,674
I didn't tell them anything. Okay?

361
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,971
I contacted him directly.
I didn't tell him why. He's discreet.

362
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,309
-You're mad at me anyway.
-I'm not mad. I'm worried.

363
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,395
I'm worried.

364
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,356
-That we can't deal with this?
-That you'll hate me

365
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,400
if we don't do it the right way.

366
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,070
The look on your face when you said
you thought Henry would be hurt if...

367
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,866
I'm sorry. I--

368
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,035
I scared you.

369
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,704
No.

370
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,456
Joe...

371
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,625
it broke my heart.

372
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,462
I see how hard
you're trying to be a good dad.

373
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,009
You're scared one little move is
gonna magically fuck it all up.

374
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,179
No, I know it's not magic
because I saw it growing up, how--

375
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,934
What kids are exposed to sticks.
Fucks them up for life.

376
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,603
You've been through a lot.
You're not fucked up for life.

377
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,023
I know.

378
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,609
But I don't wanna roll the dice
with Henry.

379
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,695
I-- You know I understand.

380
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,699
I think about it with Forty.
If he'd grown up differently, maybe--

381
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,703
I get it.

382
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:11,997
I'm just...

383
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,666
trying to fix this.

384
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,670
Hey.

385
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,255
I love you.

386
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,264
[cell phone buzzing]

387
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,939
Hey, Cy.
No, of course I'm not busy. What is it?

388
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,031
Really?

389
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,076
Oh, that's rich.

390
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,871
I cheated to get my son
into Dartmouth? Why?

391
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,041
Alan is a stellar student.
Not the world's best test-taker--

392
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,252
Dartmouth received perfect test scores
from your son.

393
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:03,673
No. He got in on his GPA,
his essay and community service.

394
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,302
And his perfect SAT score.
And there's also...

395
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,972
Yeah, all-American water polo
until a career-ending injury.

396
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,976
-That isn't my son's transcript.
-No? 'Cause there's also this.

397
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,356
That's 50 K you donated
to a Bennett's Fund

398
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,192
to help underprivileged kids have
a shot at college.

399
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,195
-[Joe] You're good at this.
-What's that got to do with anything?

400
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,699
There is no Bennett's Fund.
Or there is, but for kids like Alan.

401
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,992
[Joe] Disturbingly good.

402
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,078
That's 25,000 to a Frye family

403
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,706
whose all-star cheerleader Vicky
graduated with Alan.

404
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,877
What? Did they agree to vouch
they build houses in Haiti or some shit?

405
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,342
Wait, wait, wait.

406
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,760
-Wait a second.
-What?

407
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,139
You had no idea, did you?

408
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,143
Why...?

409
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,478
Why would my wife--?

410
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:01,940
Oh, God.

411
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,608
Oh, no.

412
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,068
Alan.

413
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,987
Not again.

414
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,532
He promised he would be good.

415
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,119
[Joe] This is worse
than some college scandal.

416
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,205
Alan did something to this Vicky.

417
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,373
It was a payoff.

418
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,920
His beloved Alan is a very bad young man
who hurts girls.

419
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,591
It was Alan in Ohio, right?

420
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,802
The girl who was attacked...

421
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,305
sexually assaulted.

422
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,557
The reason you left.

423
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,852
And he did it again.

424
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,608
I believed
that it was just a onetime mistake.

425
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,068
I made my mistakes at that age, so I--

426
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,698
I did nothing.

427
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,577
Now another girl got hurt.

428
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,414
I made poor Margaret feel
like she had to do all this.

429
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,046
[Joe] Gil said fatherhood was
just about protecting them

430
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,464
and getting out of the way,

431
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:11,593
but that's clearly not enough
to keep his son from going wrong.

432
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,721
Which is terrifying
but also exactly what we needed

433
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,556
to get Gil to play ball.

434
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,311
Our next move is to propose
his imminent relocation from Madre Linda.

435
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:25,357
Too bad for Ellie, my boss busted me,
so this book's back to the library.

436
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,650
I'll try again.

437
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,111
Now, as for Gil,
I wonder if he's marinated long enough.

438
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,282
What? No. No, no, no.

439
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,784
[shouting]

440
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,997
Oh, my God!

441
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,501
Get it off. Get it off him.

442
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,586
-Get it off him!
-I'm trying!

443
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,464
I'm trying. I'm trying.

444
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,509
[Love speaking indistinctly]

445
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,931
[Love]
Joe, we can't just sit here all night.

446
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,976
I-- I need you to talk to me.

447
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:06,898
We need to do something about this.
We need to come up with some plan.

448
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,485
Joe, I really need you to listen to me.

449
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,112
Joe.

450
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,240
Joseph Quinn-Goldberg!

451
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,492
Hey.

452
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,411
This is not our fault.

453
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,247
He did this.

454
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
It was his decision.

455
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,211
We did everything to keep our promise.

456
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,880
Why the fuck did he have to...

457
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,717
kill himself? Oh, my God.

458
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,094
He's already ruined his family.

459
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,345
[cell phone buzzes]

460
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,474
Fuck.

461
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,898
The search is starting soon.

462
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,776
Okay, okay.

463
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,071
I will make an appearance for us.

464
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,951
And then I will be back
as soon as I can. Okay?

465
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,952
Okay.

466
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,705
Okay, okay, okay.

467
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,375
Oh, my God.

468
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,085
Joe.

469
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
I have a plan.

470
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,683
[indistinct chatter]

471
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,946
[woman] In case you find something.

[Sherry clearing throat over bullhorn]

473
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,716
Hi, can you guys hear me okay? Hi.

474
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,886
Okay. Fine.

475
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,472
Thank you all for showing up.

476
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,810
If I may say on behalf
of Natalie's beautiful family,

477
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,645
we are so grateful

478
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,773
to each and every one of you.

479
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,443
Natalie is a fixture of Madre Linda.

480
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,071
We need her,

481
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,281
and now she needs us.

482
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,201
[sobbing] So good luck out there and--

483
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,161
Sorry.

484
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,710
Hashtag, "Natalie, come home."

485
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,548
[crowd applauding]

486
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,401
[Joe] The story you came up with, Love,
is fit for a steamy psychodrama.

487
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,821
Gil Brigham,
Madre Linda's answer to Ned Flanders,

488
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,989
had a secret.

489
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,618
But it was when you used
the phrase "two birds, one stone"

490
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,413
that I saw your true brilliance.

491
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,293
Two bodies, one story,
if we get this part right.

492
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,754
And we will. I will.

493
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,880
I have to.

494
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,008
It's on me to protect you and Henry.

495
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,135
There's no one else who will.

496
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,847
Here are your flags. Drop them as you go.

497
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,153
Hi, Matthew.

498
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:41,821
Hello.

499
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,909
-How are you holding up?
-Hmm.

500
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,536
I never really know
how to answer that question

501
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
when I'm out searching for my wife.

502
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,960
It's your-- I'm sorry. I was just--
I just wanted to know...

503
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,088
I'm sorry this is happening.

504
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,382
I really am.

505
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,510
Well, I guess I have you to thank.

506
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,556
For getting Theodore to come.
He told me you talked to him.

507
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,519
-He called you a kind person.
-I barely said anything. I just...

508
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,146
He seems like a good kid.

509
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:18,900
Excuse me.

510
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,624
Yo, why is everyone so scared
of Sherry Conrad?

511
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,838
She is fucking pathetic, right?

512
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,716
I hear that her husband,

513
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,804
he has to take pharmaceutical molly
just so he can get it up for her.

514
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,305
Yeah.

515
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,893
Oh, and please tell me
you saw that speech, right?

516
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,065
I have to pee. Be right back.

517
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,027
Okay.

518

00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,372
She's with her dad these days.

693
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,666
[Joe] And she throws that away. Curious.

694
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,168
Guess I don't need to ask if you've heard

695
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:12,131
about the whole awful Gil Brigham thing.

696
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,550
Yeah. Yeah, it's terrible.

697
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,467
Truly.

698
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,721
Does mean we need a new reader.

699
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,806
-You still interested?
-Sure.

700
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,933
-Of course.
-Great.

701
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,145
Oh, and I have a new rec for you.

702
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,939
David Copperfield.

703
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,734
You know, hardscrabble orphan
down on his luck.

704
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,444
Figured you could relate.

705
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,237
[Joe] She's teasing me, isn't she?

706
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,616
-Ha.
-Anyway, if you wanted to apply

707
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,077
your wizard-level book repair skills,
have at it.

708
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:47,041
[Joe] It's almost like
you're flirting with me?

709
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,002
No. No, you wouldn't.
Well, not consciously.

710
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,423
This necklace thing, nervous habit?

711
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:59,303
Why would you be nervous unless...?
It couldn't be about me. Could it?

712
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,721
You okay there, Joe?

713
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,599
[Joe] Oh, shit. What was I just doing?

714
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,893
-I'm totally fine.
-Great.

715
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,480
[Joe] I cannot be thinking
about you like this. No.

716
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,111
No, no, no. This is bad.

717
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,493
