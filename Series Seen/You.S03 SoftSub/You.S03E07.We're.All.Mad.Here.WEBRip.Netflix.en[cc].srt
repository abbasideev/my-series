-I'm Ryan Goodwin.
-Go.

-If something's wrong, tell me.
-I'm buying a vineyard.

00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,073
My dad is a lot worse than I thought.
I went into his office.

5
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:36,244
And he has
all this insane conspiracy shit,

6
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,954
including you and Joe.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,456
We are a team.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,959
The best team.

9
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,802
[Joe] Marriage is a game.

11
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,431
When things are going well,

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,809
my wife and I are on the same side,
an unshakable team.

-Oh, my God! That is impossible.
-Yeah!

19
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,368

-Okay, I got this.

...is being a good husband-- No, no.

No, the best husband,

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,338
so Love doesn't get suspicious
about what's really going on.

That I can't stop thinking about you,
Marienne.

25
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:37,555
It's been two days
since our sprinkler-soaked night.

26
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,309
You haven't texted, but I know better
than to overplay my hand.

00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,842
[cell phone chimes]

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,465
All right, so far, so good.
He's gonna meet me to talk.

30
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,718
[Joe]
If I wasn't so in love with you, Marienne,

31
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,012
I might find this more upsetting,

32
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:03,182
but as it stands,
I have to play just jealous enough.

33
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,602
You had to deploy your lace bra for that?

34
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,021
Yeah.

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,611
I know it's all a bit spooky, but...
It also kind of feels like no big deal.

36
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,323
[Joe] Is it just me
or doth the lady protest kind of a lot?

37
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,910
The sooner we find out
what Matthew could have on us,

38
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,038
if anything,
the sooner we can fix it, right?

39
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,999
[Joe] She might be more attracted to Theo
than she's willing to admit,

40
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,751
but she's also right and distracted,

41
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,463
which is necessary to keep her
from Spidey-sensing you. Speaking of...

42
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,050
Oh, the library fundraiser is coming up.

43
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,679
My boss asked me to stay late
the next couple of nights.

44
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,473
Uh, I would have said no.

45
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,392
But I think that will make her
even more irritable than usual,

46
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,228
so I hope that's okay.

47
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,690
Yeah. I mean, of course. Should I...?
Should I put it in my calendar?

48
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,901
[Joe] And have you both cross? No, no, no.

49
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:59,113
It'll be pretty boring.
I wouldn't want to inflict that upon you.

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,451
How'd I end up
with such a thoughtful husband?

51
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161
[Joe] This game is tricky.

52
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,372
Juggling you and Love won't be easy.

53
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,918
But if this is the game I have to play
to get closer to you, then game on.

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,764
[Joe] Though you haven't texted me back,
Marienne,

55
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,225
I know you felt what I felt in the rain.

56
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,768
This seems elaborate.

57
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,980
Yeah, and Alice in Wonderland,
a story dear

58
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,692
to friends-of-the-library chairwoman
Sherry Conrad, which is fabulous...

59
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,736
[Joe] You feel it right now.
You're pretending you don't.

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,656
And don't get me started
on how the friends of the library

61
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,992
only visit the library
when there's a gala.

62
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,869
[Joe] You're cautious about us,
which is smart.

63
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,497
But it means
I need to be a little bit bold.

64
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,207
I thought about you all weekend.

65
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,835
Really?

66
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,836
Um...

67
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:02,093
'Cause I couldn't stop thinking
about those goats that faint

00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,636
when they're startled.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,222
You know, like, what the fuck, Darwin?

70
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,685
-I thought about you too. A lot.
-[Joe] I knew it.

71
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,604
-But it can't happen again.
-[Joe] And here's the speech.

72
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,066
Look, I gave it a lot of thought,
and for so many reasons,

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,403
-first and foremost being you're married--
-That's true.

74
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,114
But it's not that simple, I promise you.

75
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,577
I understand.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,538
...that if I push too hard,
I risk losing you.

77
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,956
Mommy.

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,125
Hey, no running, remember?

79
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,295
Ryan surprised me
by dropping her here this morning,

80
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,255
but she's having so much fun helping out.

81
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,091
-Aren't you, mon petit chou?
-[Joe] I didn't think it was possible,

82
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,094
but in her presence,
you are even more exquisite.

83
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,554
You must be Juliette.

84
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,805
Hmm?

85
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,809
-Look what Dante found for me.
-Oh.

86
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,730
Is that Hans Christian Andersen?
Let me guess. Little Mermaid fan.

87
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,647
Hey, Dante.

88
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,565
Hey.

89
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,608
Aw.

90
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,905
-Why aren't you wearing your glasses?
-Yeah. Someone was doing cartwheels.

91
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,951
Okay, we're going to have
to get these fixed before your dad sees.

92
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,328
I can cover for you.

93
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,332
Thanks, but my car is in the shop.

94
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,541
Let me take you.

95
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,752
Does he have to come?

96
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,921
[Joe] Ouch. What'd I do to her?

97
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,674
Sorry. Yes, that would be great.

98
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,885
-Thank you.
-[cell phone buzzes]

99
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,471
Hey. I'll get back to it.

100
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,431
-Hey.
-Mom still hasn't shown up

101
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,891
and she won't answer my calls.

102
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,435
Isn't today the meeting
to finalize her divorce?

103
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,355
Yeah, three hours ago. I mean, she flaked.

104
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,315
Classic Dottie.

105
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,193
[sighs] Any chance you could watch Henry?

106
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,986
[Joe] Me, you and our kids,

107
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,656
it's not exactly the quality time
I had in mind today,

108
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,242
but what would the perfect husband do?

109
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,244
Sure. I'll be there soon.

110
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,540
-Okay. Thanks.
-[knocking on door]

111
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,544
-Hi.
-I'm sorry to pop by like this,

112
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,505
-but I just heard something terrible.
-What?

113
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,135
My caterer, for the library fundraiser,
got frostbite.

114
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,928
-Too much infrared sauna.
-Oh, my God.

115
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,182
So she's out.
Then I realized, you could fill in.

116
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,142
Oh.

117
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,521
I mean, that's really flattering,

118
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,023
but I haven't catered in a long time.

119
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,818
Don't be silly.
I'm sure it's like riding a Peloton.

120
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,403
I have to develop a menu.

121
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,656
-I'd have to hire people.
-I will handle staff and logistics.

122
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,533
You do the food,

123
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,870
collect the compliments,
get exposure for your business.

124
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,955
Don't make me beg.

125
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,129
-Okay.
-Mm! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

126
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,798
Mm...

127
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,051
-What?
-You have a glow about you

128
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,012
and I noticed it on game night too.

129
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,138
Yeah, I mean...

130
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,932
I took your advice.

131
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,727
-About choosing your soul mate.
-Mm.

132
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,730
Joe has been so attentive lately.

133
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,858
I love that. And the sex life?

134
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,860
Back on track, I assume?

135
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,822
[tsking] No. I don't mean to pry.

136
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,949
No, Joe's just been really busy with work.

137
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,368
No judgment. Have you seen the studies

138
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,538
on how quickly
our sex parts get bored of each other?

139
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:22,043
But, you know,
it doesn't have to be an issue.

140
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,129
You are so hot, Love.

141
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
-Just hack your sex life.
-Like...

142
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,759
with supplements?

143
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,472
A lot of ways to increase Joe's libido.

144
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,518
Tap into his fantasies,
really make him feel like a man.

145
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,730
It's what I've done with Cary,
and my vagina has never been happier.

146
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,566
Look, I'll send you a post
I wrote about it.

147
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,528
Along with an RSVP list of the guests

148
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,238
-with food allergies.
-Okay.

149
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,822
Thanks again.

150
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,366
[chuckling]

151
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,575
Whoo!

152
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,920
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry. Sorry. I know, I'm early.

153
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,422
-Yeah. Thank you for meeting me.
-Yeah.

154
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,593
Oh, that's--
That's not why I asked you here.

155
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,636
Okay.

156
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,597
Um...

157
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:22,061
Sorry, I feel like there's mixed signals,
'cause, like, first, we have sex.

158
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,647
-Can you--?
-It's all right. And then you know...

159
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,150
You say that it can't happen again,

160
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,697
and then you're, like,
stripping at your window,

161
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,074
asking me to meet in secret.

162
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,367
Yeah, you're right.

163
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,496
You're right. I'm a mess.

164
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,375
I guess this is what happens
when your parents get divorced

165
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,961
and you see how easily
your own marriage can fall apart.

166
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,880
-Are you and Joe--?
-Oh, no, no, no.

167
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,674
-I shouldn't have said anything.
-Hey.

168
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,593
You're not alone.

169
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,845
Honestly, like,

170
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,097
we're friends.

171
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,476
I'm your friend, if you need anything.

172
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,813
Okay.

173
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
I mean...

174
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,405
-if you really wanna help...
-Mm-hm?

175
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,283
Could you find out
what your dad has on me and Joe?

176
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,203
What--? What do you mean?
What does he have?

177
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,247
-I don't know. That's the thing.
-Okay.

178
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,750
Then-- Then why?

179
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,877
I-- I mean--

180
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,214
We've talked about this.
My family's in the public eye.

181
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,343
My parents are chopping off
each other's heads in this divorce.

182
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:39,013
-It shouldn't make my family interesting--
-If it's not like a literal crime,

183
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:43,309
-he's not gonna show anyone.
-But this is a major trigger for me.

184
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,812
I can't help but worry
when people have information on my family.

185
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,027
-I know it's not rational--
-It doesn't have to be.

186
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,570
I get it. I do.

187
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,408
-People are fucking vampires.
-[chuckles]

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,869
You know, that can scar you for sure.

189
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,037
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

190
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,665
Yeah.

191
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,958
You get it.

192
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,592
Yeah, okay. Yeah, well, you know,
I'll sneak into his office.

193
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,928
See what I can find.

194
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,225
Thank you.

195
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,274
[Joe] What's your favorite fairy tale?

196
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,235
-[Marienne] Jack and the Beanstalk.
-No.

197
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,530
Yes. Hell, yes. Jack was a little badass.

198
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,700
I wanted to be him. Screw princesses.
I know I wanted to...

199
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:51,710
[Joe] How do I make you see
I could be your happily ever after?

200
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,592
Hey, can I say something?
And you don't have to say anything back.

201
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,764
It's been a long time
since I have felt this happy.

202
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,809
This feels so easy.
So I just wanna say thank you.

203
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,312
Can we go back to the library?

204
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,818
Baby, your glasses aren't ready yet.

205
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,863
You wanna play a game?
We can play "I Spy."

206
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,780
Okay.

207
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,367
Uh, I spy with my little eye...

208
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,080
something that begins with the letter M.

209
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,416
-It's Mommy.
-Yeah.

210
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,377
Good job, baby.

211
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:39,383
[Joe] You're thinking what I am.
Is this the family we were destined for?

212
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,593
[cell phone chimes]

213
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,056
What's wrong?

214
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,351
Um, it's... It's Ryan.

215
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,687
He's giving me a heads-up

216
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,399
that Channel Three is making
a sizable donation to the library

217
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,652
and he will be at the fundraiser
to present the check.

218
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,322
You don't think it's a coincidence?

219
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,450
No, I mean, he's furious
that I'm reopening custody.

220
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,160
It's a power move.

221
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,746
He wants to show me
he can hurt me, even at my job.

222
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,500
Do you think he's watching us?

223
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,085
He feels ownership over me, okay?

224
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,505
Sick as it is. And you stood up to him.

225
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,049
So he's never gonna let that slide.

226
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,552
So this, you and me, we can't.

227
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,598
If Ryan finds out that I was
with a married man, however innocently,

228
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,060
he'll use it and I'll never get custody.

229
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,562
[Joe] You're right. Ryan is a problem,

230
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
but there are always problems
in love stories.

231
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,526
I'll find a way to solve this one,
for you.

232
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,699
[Ryan] One time, I needed a fix so badly

233
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,662
that I broke my molar
with a pair of pliers,

234
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,164
knowing that they'd give me Oxy for it.

235
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,544
That's where this disease took me.

236
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,881
I couldn't wake up without Adderall.
I couldn't go to sleep without Oxy.

237
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,216
[Joe] Interesting.

238
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,886
Let me tell you what I've learned
about your ex, Ryan Goodwin.

239
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,181
He's not a morning person.

240
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,474
He wears tighty-whities.

241
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,561
He's obsessed with protein shakes
and his workout regimen.

242
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,731
It's like he's training
for the asshole Olympics.

243
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,733
His mom, Harriet Goodwin,

244
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,572
who's also his private chef,
maid and nanny, by the looks of it.

245
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,824
It's not okay, Marienne.

246
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,576
He's gaslit his way to full custody,

247
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,579
when he doesn't even give
your daughter the time of day.

248
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,124
He leaves Juliette to his mom

249
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,460
while he works out with Wes,
his "best friend."

250
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,505
Wes makes Ryan feel superior.
So that tracks.

251
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,635
Ryan is technically sober.
But he's an emotional powder keg.

252
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,096
He's transferred
his addiction to drugs and alcohol

253
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,515
to an addiction to his body and status.

254
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
Ryan's sobriety is hanging by a thread.

255
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,187
You put a pebble into the machine
and wait for it to fail.

256
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,237
Fuck. How many shakes does one man need?

257
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,706
-[door opens]
-[Dottie humming]

258
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,958
Grandma's home.

259
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,210
Where have you--?

260
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,506
-Hey, you okay?
-Oh, I'm fine.

261
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,428
Especially after how royally
your father fucked me in the arbitration,

262
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,640
considering that I'm sober as a saint.

263
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,686
One would expect the prenup
to fuck me out of Anavrin,

264
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,105
despite the fact that I created it.

265
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,108
It's the part where he found a way
to get around my lawyer

266
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,780
and take my second-act vineyard,
my second act, for spite.

267
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,281
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,700
Sorry doesn't even cover it, Love.

269
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,037
I did everything I was supposed to do.

270
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,416
This is what happens
when you marry the wrong man.

271
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,213
-Do you disagree?
-About Dad?

272
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,008
No, he treated you horribly.
That's why I don't speak to him anymore.

273
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,595
Then why are you being so quiet?

274
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,889
I feel...

275
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,101
sad.

276
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,437
I know it's the right thing.
I'm glad that it's over.

277
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:25,401
But it feels like a...
Like a kind of loss.

278
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,570
You're right and it's sad.

279
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,366
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

280
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,076
That's not what I'm saying.

281
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,745
No, I should have known
the marriage was over two years in

282
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,039
when your father stopped
wanting to do anal.

283
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,833
I don't need the details.

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,252
Don't be such a prude.
I'm doing you a service.

285
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,045
You need to know what to look out for

286
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,090
-in your own marriage.
-My marriage is nothing like yours.

287
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,426
So you're not sleeping
with the neighbor's son?

288
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm not discussing this with you.

289
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,139
Mom!

290
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,057
It's enough.

291
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,689
Where are you going?

292
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,107
Shit.

293
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,942
I am calling a Lyft.

294
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,447
Excuse me for hoping
my daughter would lend a sympathetic ear.

-[cell phone chimes]

296

Knock, knock.

297
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:46,106
Mm. Leez. Hi. Come on in.
Please. How long has it been?

298
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,359
-Gosh, couple years, right?
-Yeah, couple of years. That's right.

299
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,489
Thanks, Theo. I'm hearing great things
about your work on the corporate side.

300
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,742
The team loves you. You've come
a long way from the cocky, young coder

301
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,204
-who hacked my e-mail.
-My asshole days are far behind me.

302
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:05,459
Here's the thing. Not too far, I hope.
I need your help with something. Please.

303
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,674
[ominous music playing]

304
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,306
This looks...

305
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,684
like a lot of security camera footage.

306
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,605
Yes. It is. It's every perimeter camera
and doorbell cam in Madre Linda.

307
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,358
Live feeds and cloud archives,
there's all of it.

308
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,777
Not gonna ask how you got it,

309
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,822
but what do you need me for
if you already have access to these?

310
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,281
I need you to help me sort it.

311
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,784
I'm drowning in footage
from a million cameras.

312
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,246
I need the ability to look
at particular people on particular dates.

313
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,207
-You want my facial-recognition algorithm.
-I do.

314
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,669
I had a scary meeting
with the FBI after that one.

315
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,587
No, no, no. They'll never know.

316
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,006
What you want will take a long time.

317
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,093
Oh, I don't think it will,
not if you're involved.

318
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,887
And I'm prepared to dramatically overpay.

319
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,056
Plus, you'd be doing a service
to the world.

320
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,391
How so?

321
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,767
Finding a murderer.

322
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,530
So you're Cary's friend?

323
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
Yeah, I'm sorry, how old are you?

324
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,744
I don't need to define myself
by something so arbitrary as a number.

325
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,997
Okay.

326
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,999
Don't worry, this isn't a sting.

327
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,170
So, FYI, I do this as a service,
someone's gonna deal,

328
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,380
so I serve as a means
of medicating the public,

329
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,091
protecting communities
likely to be profiled by the police.

330
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,135
I donate all my proceeds to NAMI.

331
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,221
The National Alliance on Mental Illness.

332
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,850
[Joe] I'm beginning to think
this generation may just save us all.

333
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,478
That'll be $1,237.37.

334
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,024
I only take Bitcoin.

335
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,485
[Joe] The lengths I will go to for you,
Marienne...

336
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,534
including sneaking in while Ryan's at work
and Juliette and Grandma are at ballet.

337
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,922
I hope Ryan enjoys his new shake recipe.

00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,049
Adderall in the morning
and Oxycontin at night

339
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,593
to reintroduce small amounts
into his system.

340
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,138
All in an effort to fire
his neurotransmitters

341
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,892
that are predisposed towards addiction,
thus inciting the phenomenon of craving.

342
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,395
If the combo of cravings
and emotional dysregulation

343
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,939
don't trigger a relapse,

344
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,651
then disrupting his morning routine will.

345
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,737
He'll be off the beam
by your next custody hearing.

00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,660
And we can thank my son's toys for that

Tonight my focus will be on Love.

It has to be,
because if Love is not happy,

we will never get the chance to be.

Their marriage was so toxic.

462
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,653
Yeah. No, I guess, it's understandable.

463
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,072
But we are not them.

Oh. No, we got a sitter.
You just take care of you.

475
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,735
So now I'm not good enough
to watch Forty? Is that it?

-What?

set this table up?

No mat.

487
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,814
[Joe] When the guests arrive,
it'll be packed in here.

488
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,525
That'll keep you
and Love apart, right? Shit.

489
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,486
Love is not stupid. This could be bad.
Why did I agree to this?

490
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,572
Okay. Okay, I need a plan.

491
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,366
I need to keep Love
as preoccupied as possible.

492
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,284
Great. Bye.

493
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,245
[Joe] Gotta hand it to you, Marienne,
you have outdone yourself.

494
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,875
You think I should just check in on them?

495
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,461
I'm just being neurotic, actually.

496
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,130
[Joe] Always. But is it too much
to hope she stays back there

497
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,257
-and you two never meet?
-Whatever you think.

498
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,554
There you are.

00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,502
You, come!

509
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,212
-We can do this fast.
-Okay.

510
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,176
[Joe] And just like that,
our fairy tale turns dark.

511
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,303
I should make a disaster
in the kitchen truck,

512
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,432
turn up the oven, scorch the quail,
but it's too late.

513
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,314
It's like I'm watching my own execution.

514
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,482
[Cary] My man!

515
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,904
-Things work out with Taschen?
-It was great. Yeah. Thank you.

516
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,240
Better than great, actually,
no sign of Ryan means

517
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,034
he's probably in hour eight
of a drug binge with his buddy.

518
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,954
[stammers] Baby, baby.

519
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,003
I'm sorry, you must be Love. I'm Marienne.

520
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,755
Joe's told me so much about you.

521
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,382
-You're Joe's boss?
-Mm-hm.

522
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,677
-It's so great to meet you.
-You as well.

523
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,682
He's probably told you
how much of a taskmaster I am.

524
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,308
No, I wouldn't say that.

525
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,853
It's true. I do have exacting standards,

526
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,022
which is probably a euphemism
for being a bossy pain in the ass.

527
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,691
No, no, he really...

528
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,360
He really loves working here.

529
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,154
Good.

530
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,031
Even if there's late shifts.

531
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,159
Yeah, yeah. I mean, he's a gem.

532
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:14,372
He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up and...

533
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:15,999
I'm, um...

534
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,626
I'm seeing someone.

535
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,754
We're in that "hang out
as much as possible" phase,

536
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,923
so Joe's been picking up my slack.

537
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,551
-Really?
-Yeah.

538
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,013
That's so sweet.
Yeah, no, he doesn't seem to mind at all.

539
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,223
Oh, that's very good to know.

540
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,769
[Joe] Whatever you're saying
seems to be working for now.

541
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:42,567
Hey, hey, heads up.
Fifty grand coming through.

542
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,404
[Joe] What the fuck?
He should be out of his mind.

543
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,323
How is he even standing right now?

544
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,866
Here we go.

545
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,993
-Not a fan?
-He's my ex.

546
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,664
Hello. You both look lovely.
What should I do with this?

547
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,751
Don't want it out
before the big unveiling.

548
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,294
Let me show you.

549
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,129
Excuse us.

550
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,343
Hey, Dante.

551
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,264
That guy is the fucking worst.

552
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,350
[Joe] Oh, Dante,
one cannot even begin to fathom.

553
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,145
He seems smug, I suppose.
But recovery can't be easy.

554
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,773
Recovery? That prick's never been sober.

555
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,320
His AA stuff is all for show.
There's drugs in his protein shake.

556
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,113
-Like, today?
-Always.

557
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,493
I took a sip on accident once.
I got so tweaked, I couldn't sleep.

558
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,121
And then I realized,
he pounds that stuff all day. Every day.

559
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,790
[Joe] I have been played.

560
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,751
I couldn't dose Ryan

561
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,962
because he's been dosing himself
the whole time

562
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,798
and his tolerance is through the roof.
How did I miss this?

563
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,342
Dante! How's it hanging, buddy?

564
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,679
So much better now that you're here.
Will you excuse me?

565
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,600
Joe Goldberg, right? I'm Ryan Goodwin.

566
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,354
We met the other night
when I wasn't being my best self.

567
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,856
That's right. It's good to re-meet you.

568
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,775
You fucking cockroach.

569
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,694
Oh! Fuck!

570
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,738
That's meat. Where are you from?

571
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,198
-New York.
-The city?

572
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,783
Brooklyn.

573
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,035
-How's the wine?
-It's okay, I guess.

574
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,414
You know, it's interesting.

575
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,167
I've seen you,
lurking in the back of meetings,

576
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,752
pretending like you're invisible.

577
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,796
But given the way
you're nursing that drink,

578
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,799
you don't strike me as someone
who has a drinking problem.

579
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,801
[Joe] Fuck, how much of me did he see?

580
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,094
You gotta try this.

581
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,015
It is, like, Iberian or some shit.
Yeah, give it a taste. Come on.

582
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,850
Come on, taste.

583
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,146
[Joe] What is this?
A sociopath's power play?

584
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:52,238
I don't know what you're up to,
but I bet my dick, it's about Marienne.

585
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,907
Stay away from her.

586
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,079
Enjoy the party.

587
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,293
[Joe] I lost this round,
but this isn't over.

588
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,211
Not when you are at stake.

589
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:17,096
This looks amazing. Unh!

590
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,683
I am so good.

591
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,978
Unh. I knew you'd do me right.

592
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:24,896
Thanks.

593
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,651
I can't wait any longer. This is torture.

594
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,237
Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

595
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,114
What?

596
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,950
Didn't you read the post I sent you?

597
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,995
Yeah, that really spun me out, Sherry.

598
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,040
The biological importance
of making your man feel like a man?

599
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,249
I...

600
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,212
I just don't think
I'm one of these hot wives.

601
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,129
Oh.

602
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,634
You should've kept reading.

603
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,677
Okay...

604
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,599
Hot Wife is a term...

605
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,809
Right.

606
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:07,271
...for women in open marriages.

607
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,193
Like me. Cary and I are polyamorous.

608
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,614
Love, please, tell me you got the part
where I sent you a post I wrote.

609
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,409
As in, that's my secret sex blog.

610
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,288
Oh, I do not think
that I picked up on that.

611
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,959
Well, now you know.

612
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,047
And the more time
we spend with you and Joe,

613
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:38,344
well, we can't stop thinking
about the two of you.

614
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,144
We would love...

615
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:55,236
to take our relationship to a new level.

616
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,078
Would you be game?

617
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,461
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh.

618
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,964
Sorry, it's my babysitter.

619
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,342
What the fuck?

620
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,894
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

621
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,275
[cell phone ringing]

622
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,739
Let's hang up on your mother.

623
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,616
We don't need to speak to her.

624
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,285
Thank you.

625
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,955
Stephanie, what a pretty name.

626
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,251
Oh, don't worry, he's not a baby.

627
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,797
No, no, he's the reincarnation
of my son, Forty,

628
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,674
and he loves a good taco.

629
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,343
Don't you, baby? Yes.

630
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,013
My daughter's trying to keep him from me.
She's selfish like her father.

631
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,182
I think we're missing
a couple of "gordatas."

632
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,266
Uh--

633
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,394
-They're coming right out.
-Bless you, Persephone.

634
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,273
-You're a good person, aren't you?
-I guess.

635
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,153
I just want Love to understand
where I'm coming from,

636
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,489
but she refuses to listen.

637
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,283
No one will listen.

638
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,703
Except you.

639
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,207
-[car horn honks]
-I'm getting my gordatas.

640
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,917
Chrissake.

641
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,919
No, I need my power back.

642
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,839
I need justice. I need karmic retribution.

643
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,553
-Do you want hot sauce?
-I want all the hot sauce and a lighter.

644
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,430
Excuse me?

645
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,307
I'll give you...

646
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,727
300 dollars for a lighter.

647
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,491
Thank you for listening.

648
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
Let's go.

649
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,748
[rock music playing over speakers]

650
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,297
[sirens wailing]

651
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,511
Oh, yeah.

652
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,056
The bastard wanted the vineyard.

653
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,479
-[Henry crying]
-Oh, oh!

654
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,441
Hey, hey, hey. You're okay.

655
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,947
[Joe] Note to self,
if you take a baby on a drunk joyride

656
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,117
to go burn down a vineyard,
make sure you're a rich, white lady

657
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,786
whose lawyer can get you
in a fancy rehab instead of jail.

658
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,165
-Thank you for--
-What the fuck were you thinking?

659
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,209
Just put him to bed, okay? I've got this.

660
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,435
You can sleep here tonight.

661
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,146
Tomorrow, Joe will drive you to rehab.

662
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,273
You'll never see me.

663
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,194
And you will never see Henry ever again.

664
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,864
-You don't mean that.
-I do. With every fiber of my being.

665
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,659
Love, please. I made a mistake.
But I've been punished--

666
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,495
You could have killed him!

667
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,582
You had your family...

668
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,251
and look what you did.

669
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,672
You let your husband destroy
your self-worth.

670
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,469
You neglected your children.
You didn't protect Forty. I did that.

671
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,762
Oh, that's rich.

672
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,598
You liked him broken

673
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,850
-'cause it gave you purpose.
-Maybe.

674
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,064
But I have a new purpose now
and that's protecting my family.

675
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,276
-From you. [laughs]
-How can you say that? I'm your mother.

676
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,407
Having no mother would be better.

677
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,500
You think you're so much better than me?
You're just me 20 years ago.

678
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,295
One day, you will lose everything too.

679
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,006
And then you'll see
how cruel you really are.

680
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,642
Oh. Hey.

681
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,520
Did you get it done? Whatever it is.

682
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,605
Yep, just finished up.

683
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,442
So, what were you doing?

684
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,154
He totally passed out.
Think he really needs some rest.

685
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:58,664
Look, it's none of my business,
but your dad is not okay.

686
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,917
He needs help.

687
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,420
I'll let myself out.

688
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,926
[door opens, then closes]

689
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,888
["Numb" playing]

690
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:09,735
[Joe] I should be in bed with you,
tracing and drawing on your arm.

691
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:14,949
Instead, I'm driving an Uber
shuttling Medusa-in-law to rehab.

692
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,577
Bet you're happy
you won't have to see me anymore.

693
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,415
I always thought
we had a good relationship.

694
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,464
I have something to tell you, Joe.

695
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,053
I see how hard you're trying
to make your marriage work, just like me.

696
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,931
I did everything
to keep my family together,

697
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,101
including lying to myself
about who my husband was...

698
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,144
and who my daughter is.

699
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,398
[Joe] Is this where Dottie tries
to poison me against Love?

700
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,233
Her final act of revenge?

701
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,777
How much do you know
about Love's first husband, James?

702
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:53,904
Um...

703
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,284
I know they were in love. Married young.

704
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,328
He got cancer and then he died.

705
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,289
Not quite.

706
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,835
When James became ill,
he and Love were already having problems.

707
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,337
After he went into remission,

708
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,797
he asked for a divorce.

709
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,342
And the next thing you know, he was dead.

710
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,344
[Joe] Surely, she's not suggesting...

711
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,764
I have no proof, of course.
Just a mother's intuition.

712
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,392
You probably think I'm crazy.

713
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:28,355
[Joe] I might, if I hadn't seen
what Love is capable of, many times.

714
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,940
This must be hard.

715
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,775
You're loyal.

716
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,111
That's what makes you a good husband.

717
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,408
But Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

718
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,788
If anything were to happen to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

719
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,589
Like a young Gregory Peck.

720
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,052
[Joe]
Could Love have killed her first husband?

721
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:03,349
I've been so worried about her hurting you
that I failed to remember:

722
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,309
I am also fair game.

723
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,533
[Joe] But we should be together, Marienne.
I will find a way.

724
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,663
It's risky, but love requires
a hint of madness.

725
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,457
We're all mad here, right, red rose?

726
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,917
-Hey.
-Hey.

727
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,877
-Is everything okay?
-No.

728
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,804
Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

729
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,806
He's threatening to use it against me.

730
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,517
What? We're just colleagues.

731
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,061
We're not. And you know that.

732
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,938
And besides, it doesn't matter

733
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,941
because Ryan will make it look
as bad as possible.

734
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,777
[Joe] Fucking Ryan. I'll destroy him.

735
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,612
-We can fix this.
-We?

736
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,157
What are you talking about?
You're married.

737
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,869
Your marriage doesn't seem strained.
Your wife is lovely.

738
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,623
[Joe] Lovely, yes. With a mild habit
of murdering women I care about.

739
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,000
I hated having to lie to her.

740
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,171
I slid into old patterns
and I feel disgusted.

741
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,214
I...

742
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,883
It's not good for my recovery.

743
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,929
I'm at a point where I'm supposed to live
with integrity. I can't be a home-wrecker.

744
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,056
Of course not.

745
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,226
But there has to be another way.

746
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,352
There isn't.

747
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,355
Hey.

748
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,859
I care about you. I do.

749
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,779
And, yeah, there's chemistry.

750
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,697
[Joe] But...

751
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,991
But, no, I have to think of Juliette.

752
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,619
And I promised myself,
my next relationship would be...

753
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,706
Would be aboveboard and honest.

754
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,001
I'm sorry.

755
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,798
[Joe] Aboveboard and honest.

756
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,842
How do I give that to you?

757
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,768
You good?

758
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,189
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-- I'm tired.

759
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,650
Can I get your opinion on something?

760
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,693
Yeah, of course.

761
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,365
-What do you think about this?
-What is this?

762
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,244
Sherry sent it.
It's from her secret sex blog.

763
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,581
-Sherry and Cary are in an open marriage.
-Hmm.

764
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,377
And... they wanna sleep with us.

765
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,426
Yeah, I thought it was a joke too.

766
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,179
So--? So why are you showing me this?

767
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,809
As a joke, obviously.

768
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,810
Oh.

769
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,148
You don't really look at me the same.

770
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,484
You don't seem interested
in having sex with me.

771
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,945
That's not true.
People go through rough patches.

772
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,613
I don't wanna become...

773
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,115
like my parents.

774
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,370
They couldn't stay in love.

775
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,498
Maybe we need to shake things up.

776
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,585
It sounds crazy, but I read that article.

777
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,795
[Joe] Opening our marriage.

778
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,880
This loophole cannot be falling
into my lap.

779
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,341
I don't even know how I feel about it.

780
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:28,220
Sherry just said it was the greatest hack,

781
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,014
and I guess...

782
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,851
Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

783
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,937
[Joe] I'd rather take
a chain saw to my thigh,

784
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,438
but hopefully, that's negotiable.

785
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,440
Sorry, I'm just being stupid.

786
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,235
Love, Love, stop, stop, stop backpedaling.

787
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,822
You can come to me with anything.

788
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,575
That's what this marriage is, right?

789
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,121
No idea is too crazy?
We talk things through, right?

790
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,583
And we make decisions together.

791
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,171
I love you.

792
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,971
[Joe] And I love you.

793
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,272
[door locks]

794
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,740
[ominous music playing]

795
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,418
[theme music playing]
