00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,440
Same thing.

183
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,030
If it's the same thing, then
why'd you write workspace?

184
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,800
Just knock, please?

185
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,650
OK-- as a sign of a
respect for your superior?

186
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,880
You are not my superior.

187
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,210
Oh, gee, then why
do I have an office?

188
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,410
Thought it was a
workspace, Dwight.

189
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,440
OK.

190
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,280
Dwight, are you really
in charge of picking

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,200
the health care plan?

192
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,970
Yes, and my decision is final.

193
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,290
This is a
ridiculously awful plan

194
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,910
because you cut everything.

195
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,540
DWIGHT: (SARCASTICALLY)
Oh, times are tough, Pam.

196
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,240
Deal with it--

197
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,660
You cut more than you
had to, didn't you?

198
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,370
DWIGHT: Sure.
-Well, why did you do that?

199
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,050
You work here, don't
you want good insurance?

200
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,820
Don't need it.

201
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,430
Never been sick--
perfect immune system.

202
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,130
OK.

203
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,380
Well, if you've
never been sick then

204
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,980
you don't have any antibodies.

205
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,540
I don't need them--
superior genes.

206
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,250
I'm a Schrute-- and
superior brain power.

207
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,870
Through concentration,
I can raise and lower

208
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,720
my cholesterol at will.

209
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,740
Why would you wanna
raise your cholesterol?

210
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,090
So I can lower it.

211
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,020

come out of his office.

213
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,020
He's gotta come out sometime--
to got to the bathroom.

that's inappropriate.

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,240
Michael, can I talk to you?

217
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,620
Uh, uh, I would love
to but I am really busy.

218
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,350

219

MEREDITH: Uh, Michael?

220
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,690
Michael, please, can we
talk to you about this memo?

221
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,150
MICHAEL: Uh, what--
which a-- which memo?

222
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,230
Dwight's health care memo.

223
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,940
I told you about it.
-It a good plan?

224
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,300
It's a great plan-- saves
the company a fortune.

225
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,890
OSCAR: It's like a pay decrease.

226
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,410
Michael, he made huge cuts.

227
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,370
Cuts-- what-- wow,
Dwight, did you make cuts?

228
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,640
Yeah, you said to
go ahead and trim--

229
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,120
No, no no, no no,
no, you know what?

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,960
I said nothing specific
because I was so busy.

231
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,930
Why don't you go
in there, Dwight,

232
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,580
and find these people a plan
that'll work for them, OK?

233
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,380
DWIGHT: I can handle it.

234
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,980
MICHAEL: OK?

235
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,260
All right.

236
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,970
We feel good?

237
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,430
All right.
Good.

238
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,550
Plus, there's some
other good news.

239
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,950
Today, at the end of the
day, I will have, for all

240

of you, a big surprise, OK?

241
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,360
So hang in there and I will
see you at the end of the day,

242
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,170
all right?

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
OSCAR: This is not good.

244
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,490
It's ridiculous.

245
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,290
Did you talk to him?

246
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,860
What was that?

247
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,130
--You let him walk all over you.

248
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,250
It's just pathetic.

guys talking about?

251
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,900
Do I know what the surprise is?

252
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,750
Hell, no.

253
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,270
It doesn't matter.

254
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,350
The point is, they're
not unhappy anymore.

255
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,760
They're out there thinking, wow,
my boss really cares about me.

256
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
He has a surprise.

257
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,330
He's cool.

258
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,510
Why-- what a great guy.

259
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,400
I love him.

260
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I love him.

261
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
OK, everyone.
Gather round.

262
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,190
Step forward.

263
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,090
It has been brought to my
attention that some of you

264
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,380
are unhappy with my plan.

265
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,520
So what I'd like you to do is
to fill this out and write down

266
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,550
any diseases you have that
you might want covered,

267
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,820
and I'll see what I can do.

268
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,520
OK.

269
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,250
You know what, Dwight?

270
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,040
We can't write our
diseases down for you

271
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,940
because that's confidential.
-OK.

272
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,560
Well, I didn't say to write
your name down, did I?

273
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,030
Fill it out, leave
it anonymous or don't

274
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,050
write any disease down at
all, and it won't be covered.

275
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,010
Sound fair?
Good.

276
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,660
All right, I'll be in my office.

277
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,400

278
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,390
You know what, come with me.

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,850

Couldn't find the knob.

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,210
So basically, I
want to do something

286
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,840
nice for my employees.

287
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,180

288
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,770
They have this thing where they
send a bus, right-- for free.

289
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,870
It picks everybody up.

290
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,730
You head down there, get to
the hotel, room is comped,

291
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,450
and they give you a
big pile of chips,

292
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,810
and your food-- everything
just kind of all inclusive,

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
I don't know of
anything like that.

295
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,610
But, um, you know
what you might want

296
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,330
to do is just call those
casinos directly, uh, maybe?

297
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,730

298
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,670

were inventing diseases?

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,300
Um, trying to give
the troops around here

315
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,540
a little bit of a boost,
and I was thinking

316
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,110
that maybe we could
take 'em down to take

317
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,460
a spin on your big ride.

318
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,090

the elevator that takes

319
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,880
you down into the mine shaft?

320
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
It's not really a ride.

321
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,580
It says here that
it's a 300 foot drop.

322
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,780
MALE (ON PHONE): Well, it
goes 300 feet into the earth

323
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,680
but it moves really slowly.

324
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,460
So it's not a free fall.

325
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,320
MALE (ON PHONE): It's an
industrial coal elevator.

326

327
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,490
Well, once you get down
into the mine, what do you--

328
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,950
you got laser tag or something?
OK.

329
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,650
OK.

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,080

the surprise is.

No.

This is my world.

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,190
This is improv.

All right, who did this?
I'm not mad.

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,350
I just want to know who did
it so I can punish them.

What are you talking about?

343

Uh, Someone-- uh-- forged
medical information and that

344
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,310
is a felony.
-OK.

345
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,070
Whoa.

346
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,280
All right-- 'cause that's a
pretty intense accusation.

347
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,580

that they're fake?

You did this, didn't you?
-Absolutely not.

DWIGHT: Yes you did.
-No, I didn't.

354
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,510
I know it was you.
OK, fine.

355
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,210
You know what?

356
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm going to have to interview

that down, Jim?

I want that covered.

from a vagina.
