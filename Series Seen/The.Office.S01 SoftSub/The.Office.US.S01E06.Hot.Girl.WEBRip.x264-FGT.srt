00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:37,671
(WOMAN ON SPEAKER PHONE)
Are you listening
to me, Michael?

2
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,373
Affirmative.

3
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,542
What did I just say?

4
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,345
You just said--
Let me, uh...

5
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,479
check my notes.

6
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,680
You just said...

7
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,517
Alan and I have created
an incentive program--

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,419
Hey!
Hey, how is Alan?

9
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:55,223
Tell Alan that the Mets suck.
Okay?

10
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,591
From me, big time.
Go Pirates!

11
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,393
Not gonna do that,
Michael.

12
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,129
We've created an incentive
program to increase sales.

13
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:02,496
Uh-huh.

14
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,732
At the end of the month,
you can reward your top seller

15
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,400
with a prize worth
up to $1,000.

16
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,635
Whoa, howdy ho.

17
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,503
Wow, 1,000 big ones.
That's cool.

18
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,505
Do I, uh, do I get
to pick the prize?

19
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,407
Uh...yes.
Yes, you can.

20
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,842
UM, QUESTION:

21
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,846
Does "top salesman" include
people who were at one time

22
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,384
such outstanding salesmen
that they've been promoted to--

23
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,318
No, Michael.

24
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:26,820
No, you can't
win this prize.

25
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,756
I didn't mean me.

26
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,397
Well, first
what we have to do

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,467
is find out what motivates
people more than anything else.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,501
Sex.

29
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,502
It's illegal.
I can't do that.

30
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,503
Next best thing.

31
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,504
Torture.

32
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,505
Come on, Dwight.

33
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:45,506
Just help me out here.

34
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,540
That's stupid.

35
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:47,541
Um, Michael--

36
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,476
Pam!

37
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,211
Hey, there's--
Burger with cheese!

38
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,745
There's a person here--
And fries!

39
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,913
There's--
And shake!

40
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,515
What?
Go ahead.

41
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,450
There's a person here
who wants to sell handbags.

42
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,885
No, no, no.
No vendors in the office.

43
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,420
That is a distraction.

44
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,155
Okay, I told her you'd
talk to her at least--

45
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,390
Pam, come on, I'm busy.

46
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:03,691
So just
tell her to go away.

47
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,293
Okay.

48
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,329
(SIGH)

49
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,367
All right,
I'll talk to her.

50
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,335
This one is hand-embroidered.

51
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,669
All right, girls,
break it up.

52
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,405
You're being infiltrated.

53
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:18,539
Cock in the henhouse.

54
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,274
Cocks in the henhouse.
Don't say cocks.

55
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,809
Oh! Ahem!

56
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,945
(IRISH ACCENT)
What is your name,
my fair lass?

57
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,946
Katy.

58
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,617
Ah, Katy.
Wow, look at you!

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,553
You are, uh, you're like
the new and improved Pam.

60
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,954
Pam 6.0.

61
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,756
(LAUGHING)
Ohh, look!

62
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,559
Oh, hey, no cat fights,
you two.

63
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,860
I'm against violence
in the workplace.

64
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,495
So am I.
Nobody cares
what you think.

65
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,563
Doesn't matter.

66
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,897
So, uh,
you know what?

67
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,567
I usually don't allow
solicitors in the office.

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,603
But today, I am going
to break some rules.

69
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,838
And you can
have the conference room.

70
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,872
It's yours,
all day.

71
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,307
Wow, thanks.

72
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,409
There's an HR meeting
in there at 11:30.

73
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,811
Well, let's put them
in the hallway.

74
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,513
We'll give them
some chairs.

75
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,615
Right?
Decisiveness!

76
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,950
One of the keys
to success,

77
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,985
according
to Small Businessman.

78
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,421
I do, I read
Small Businessman.

79
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,958
I also subscribe
to USA Today,

80
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,262
and American Way,
um, magazine.

81
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,496
That's the in-flight
magazine.

82
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,531
Some great articles
in that.

83
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,502
They did this great
profile last month

84
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,272
of Doris Roberts,

85
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,341
and where she likes to eat
when she's in Phoenix.

86
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,310
Illuminating.

87
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,778
This is my conference room.

88
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,381
So please, uh,
make yourself at home.

89
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,515
Whatever you need,

90
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,617
I'm right on the other side
of this wall.

91
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,386
Used to be a window here.

92
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,920
There's not anymore.

93
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,255
So that's
where I will be.

94
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,624
So, ahem...

95
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,025
If you need anything else,

96
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,527
something to make you
more comfortable...

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,562
Just don't hesitate
to ask.

98
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,664
I'm right here.

99
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,566
I guess a cup of coffee
would be great.

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,935
Wait a second!

101
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,038
Ah! I should have spotted
another addict.

102
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,607
Oh, gotta love
the 'Bucks!

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,974
What?

104
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,343
It's like a slang
for Starbucks.

105
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,444
They're all over
the place.

106
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:07,381
Oh, man, that place is like
the promised land to me.

107
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,350
What a business model too.

108
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,852
Oh, too bad we don't
have the good stuff here.

109
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,587
Regular coffee is fine.

110
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,623
No, it's not, it's--

111
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,857
No, really, it is.

112
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,359
No, here's the thing.

113
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:23,531
You know,
I do my best to--

114
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,567
to be my own man,
and, uh...

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,737
go by the beat
of a different drummer.

116
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,572
And nobody gets me.

117
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,341
And they're always
putting up walls,

118
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,742
and I'm always
tearing them down.

119
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,711
Just breaking down barriers.
That's what I do all day.

120
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,651
So...a coffee.

121
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,719
Regular coffee.
For you.

122
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,721
High test or unleaded?

123
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,890
Bring it on.

124
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,525
Ooh, ho!
Whoo!

125
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,761
I will, I'll bring it on!
All right!

126
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,499
So...are you jealous

127
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,501
'cause there's
another girl around?

128
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,636
No.

129
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,705
She's prettier than you,
though.

130
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,479
That's a very rude
thing to say, Kevin.

131
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,819
So you like the periwinkles
and the purples?

132
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,755
DWIGHT:
The purse girl hits
everything on my checklist.

133
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,792
Creamy skin,
straight teeth,

134
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,662
curly hair,
amazing breasts--

135
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,664
not for me,
for my children.

136
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,033
The Schrutes produce
very thirsty babies.

137
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,101
There you go!

138
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,069
Nice, steaming hot
cup of Joe.

139
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,971
Thank you.
I have an idea.

140
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,907
Why don't
I introduce you around?

141
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,510
You know, you can kind of
get your foot in the door,

142
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,811
meet potential
clientele, right?

143
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,079
Gosh, I'm--
I would love to,

144
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,948
but my purses,
I should, um--

145
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,484
Oh, um, well,
we can have Ryan take a look.

146
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,919
Ryan, would you look
after the purses, please?

147
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,921
Uh, I'm installing File Share
on all the computers.

148
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,656
Yeah, well, blah
dee blooh dah blah blah.

149
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,624
Techno babble.

150
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,159
Just do it, okay?
We have company, right?

151
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,694
You should sell
a lot here,

152
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,631
because this branch made
over $1 million last year.

153
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,765
Not that we're
all millionaires.

154
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,834
I'm probably closest,
so...

155
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,703
Here's Oscar!
Oscar, this is Katy.

156
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:10,771
I'm on the phone.

157
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,573
Ooh, ooh, oh,
Oscar the Grouch.

158
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,542
Right?
I thought of that.

159
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,510
That was
on Sesame Street.

160
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,711
I know, I know, I know.

161
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,812
I made the connection.

162
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,514
Can you believe
he'd never heard that

163
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,749
before he worked here?

164
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,983
No, I don't
believe that.

165
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,852
I know,
it's unbelievable.

166
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,120
It's nice
having Katy around.

167
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:31,425
It's another person
for Michael to, um...

168
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,794
interact with.

169
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,796
Here is Toby
from Human Resources.

170
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,097
Katy, Toby.

171
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,799
Toby, Katy!
Hi, nice to meet you.

172
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,868
Did you go
to Bishop O'Hara?

173
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,736
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.

174
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,037
Cool.
What year were you there?

175
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,573
'89.
Toby's divorced.

176
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,475
He, uh...God.

177
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,842
Recently, right?

178
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,110
Yeah.
You and your wife?

179
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,079
And you have kids?
A girl.

180
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,481
Oh, that's so...

181
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,215
That was really messy.

182
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,753
He slept one night
in your car too?

183
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,889
I should probably
get back to my table.

184
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,090
Okay, all right.

185
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,192
Cool.
See you in a bit.

186
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,063
Oh!
Hey, she's cute.

187
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,866
Cutie pie.
Back to work!

188
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,802
I live by one rule.

189
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,170
No office romances,
no way.

190
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,708
Very messy,
inappropriate.

191
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,875
No.

192
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,511
But...

193
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,879
I live by another rule.

194
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,114
Just do it.

195
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,816
Nike.

196
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,651
Hey, Jimmy,
what do you think

197
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,686
about that little
purse girl, huh?

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,488
Cute, sure, yeah.

199
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,956
Why don't you
get on that?

200
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,858
She's not really my type.

201
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,727
What, are you gay?

202
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,596
Mmm, I don't
think so, no.

203
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,097
KEVIN:
Well, what
is your type?

204
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,869
Moms...primarily.

205
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,805
Yep, soccer moms,
single moms, NASCAR moms.

206
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,006
Any type of mom, really.

207
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,608
That's disgusting.

208
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,076
KEVIN:
Stay away from my mom.

209
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,611
Too late, Kev.

210
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,216
(ROY SIGHS)

211
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,054
Man, I would be all over that
if I wasn't dating Pam.

212
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,290
We're not dating,
we're engaged.

213
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,660
Engaged, yeah.

214
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,841
JIM:
Pam and I are good buddies.

215
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,142
I'm sort of Pam's
go-to guy

216
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,878
for her problems.

217
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,113
You know,
with stuff like work

218
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,683
or, uh, her fiancé Roy.

219
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,051
Or, um...

220
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,288
Nope, those are pretty much
her only two problems.

221
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,623
JIM:
She'd be perfect
for you.

222
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,423
DWIGHT:
Mmm.

223
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,759
She's been talking
to Michael a lot.

224
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:46,827
So what?

225
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,662
You're Assistant
Regional Manager.

226
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:49,930
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.

227
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:50,998
Well, you know what,
Dwight?

228
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,733
He's your work boss, okay?

229
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,134
He is not
your relationship boss.

230
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,135
That's true.

231
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,637
Plus, you have
so much more

232
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,871
to talk
to this girl about.

233
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:01,742
You're both, um, salesmen.

234
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,043
I mean, that's something
right there.

235
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,111
True.

236
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,679
Plus, I could talk to her

237
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,848
about the origins
of my last name.

238
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,917
It's all gold.

239
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,286
Guys are usually
my best customers.

240
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,855
They buy
the high-end stuff,

241
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,724
like the beads
and the sequins and stuff,

242
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,859
for gifts, you know.

243
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,993
They don't know
what they're looking at,

244
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,329
so I make suggestions.

245
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,864
All right,
here's the thing, okay?

246
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,699
You just
keep talking to her.

247
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,300
If you hit a stall,
you have a perfect fallback.

248
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,836
What's that?
You buy a purse.

249
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,838
I don't want a purse.
Purses are for girls.

250
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,272
Dwight, that's not
necessarily true.

251
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,774
Do you read GQ?

252
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,075
No.
Okay, I do.

253
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,877
They're like mini briefcases,
all right?

254
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,345
Lots of guys have them.

255
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,113
Like those?
Yes!

256
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,915
Listen, you are spending
way too much time

257
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,884
talking to me when
you could be talking to her.

258
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,352
Okay, I'm just gonna
use the bathroom and then--

259
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,854
No, you don't
need the bathroom.

260
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,022
You've got it.
Go.

261
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,727
(WHISPERING)
Okay, shh. Stop.

262
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:54,862
Stop whatever
you're doing,

263
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,731
'cause this
is going to be good.

264
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,933
JIM:
(high voice mimicking)
Hi, my name is Dwight Schrute,

265
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,035
and I would like
to buy a purse from you.

266
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,337
Good Lord,
look at these purses!

267
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,707
This is something special.

268
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,045
Oh, my God, is this
Salvatore Dacinni purse?

269
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,915
Oh, definitely--definitely
step in and out of it like that.

270
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,217
JIM:
Yes, well, I want
to stress test it.

271
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,285
You know,

272
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,953
in case anything happens.

273
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,955
Oh!
Oh!

274
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,224
(LAUGHING)
That was really--

275
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,993
This is necessary to do

276
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,861
to really give it
a good workout.

277
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,930
This is the--ooh.

278
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,799
This is the prettiest
one of all.

279
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,802
I'm gonna be the prettiest
girl in the ball.

280
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,236
Oh, how much?

281
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,338
Oh, God, it's sad.

282
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,840
It's so sad.

283
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,275
Here he comes, shh.

284
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,348
(GIGGLING)

285
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,817
He did pick
a good one.

286
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,918
You're horrible.

287
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,986
This one's really good
for a hot date.

288
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,854
Yeah, what's that?

289
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:54,888
(BOTH LAUGH)

290
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,189
I'm engaged.

291
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,024
Oh, congratulations.

292
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,992
You need a hot date
more than anyone.

293
00:10:59,026 --> 00:10:59,827
Oh, I wish, right?

294
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,295
Giggle, giggle,
shooshy, shooshy.

295
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,630
I get it, I get it.

296
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,933
Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood over here.

297
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,134
Right?

298
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,237
So, how was that coffee
from earlier?

299
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,371
Good.

300
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,873
Ah, I knew it.

301
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:16,176
Guzzled it down.
You greedy little thing.

302
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,179
So, uh, Pam,
is this your lunch break

303
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,981
or was that earlier,

304
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:26,053
when you were eating
in the kitchen with those guys?

305
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,888
(GASPS)
Sorry.

306
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,022
Busted.

307
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,323
(LAUGHS)

308
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,424
Come back?
Oh, hey!

309
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,325
I wanna show you something.

310
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,927
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

311
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,996
I know you
are gonna like this.

312
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,031
Picked it up today.
1,000 big ones.

313
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,399
Is that from Starbucks?

314
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,335
Yes, this is a Starbucks
Digital Barista.

315
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,938
This is the mack daddy
of espresso makers.

316
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,807
Wow, is that
for the office?

317
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,308
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

318
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,043
Ooh, you're not prying this
out of my hands.

319
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,912
(LAUGHS)

320
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,446
But don't tempt me,
'cause I'll give it to you.

321
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,816
I wouldn't think of it.

322
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,819
Coffee is the great
"incentivizer" in the office.

323
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,488
It's a drug--
it is quite literally a drug

324
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,924
that speeds people up.

325
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,993
It's not the only drug
that speeds people up.

326
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:09,830
You hear stories about
Dunder Mifflin in the '80s

327
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,165
before everybody knew
how bad cocaine was.

328
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,202
Gah--man,
did they move paper!

329
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:21,775
Oh, the rotating, uh,
steam...wand.

330
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,276
What?
What's the matter?

331
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,046
Oh, nothing.
My ride just bailed on me.

332
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,215
Oh, oh, God, I'm sorry.

333
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,416
Is it--
Oh, no, it's--

334
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,784
Where you going?
Nearby?

335
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,052
Because I could
give you a ride.

336
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,253
No.
Sure?

337
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,355
I don't wanna
inconvenience you.

338
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,090
No, no, no, no, no!
No inconvenience.

339
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,892
I mean, I'm out of here
at 5:00 sharp.

340
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,061
At 5:00?
I can go earlier,
'cause I'm the boss.

341
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,932
You know, whatever.
I'm outta here...slaves.
Okay.

342
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:45,966
What?

343
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,301
Okay.
Okay!

344
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,804
I guess that would be--
I guess that would be okay.

345
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,539
Okay, sounds good,
sounds good.

346
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,408
5:00 sharp, I will give
you and your purses a ride home.

347
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,977
Okay, cool.

348
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,978
Right! Great!

349
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,112
Cool.
Cool!

350
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,014
Cool!

351
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,319
Nyah, okay.

352
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,489
I should never have
let the temp touch this thing.

353
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,193
I had all these great icons,
and now I have four folders.

354
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,228
It's actually
better this way.

355
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,897
No, it's not,
because I could just

356
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,166
click on the icon
and then I'm onto something--

357
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,500
Michael, could I
ask you something?

358
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,236
I wanted to ask your permission
to ask out Katy.

359
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,105
I know it's against
the rules and everything--

360
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,606
No, no, no, it's not
against the rules.

361
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,176
Ahem. She is not
a permanent employee,

362
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,143
so it's not.

363
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,145
Thank you, Michael.
I appreciate this so much.

364
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,546
But I think
you should just know

365
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,250
that I am going to be
giving her a ride home later.

366
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,952
What?

367
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,120
She asked me for a ride,

368
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,389
and so I'm going
to give her a ride home.

369
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,957
Is that all it is?

370
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,325
Just a ride home?

371
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,027
Like a taxi cab?

372
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,529
Well, it might
be a ride home.

373
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:54,267
Might be a ride home,
and we stop for coffee and...

374
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,602
dot, dot, dot.

375
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,908
Please...please...

376
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,209
I am your inferior,

377
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,944
and I'm asking you
this favor.

378
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:07,614
Can you promise me that
it will just be a ride home?

379
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,286
No.
I cannot promise.

380
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,488
You cannot promise me
or you won't promise me?

381
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,490
Listen, Dwight--

382
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,892
Do you love her?

383
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,027
(SCOFFS)
Dwight, no.

384
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,429
I--I don't know.

385
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,064
It's too early to tell.

386
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,134
I--I don't know
how I feel.

387
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,007
I think you've made
a really good choice.

388
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,008
She's really
gonna like that.

389
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,910
Hmm.
Espresso?

390
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,011
Oh, thank you.

391
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,412
You're welcome.

392
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,547
Thank you.

393
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,015
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

394
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,016
Mmm!

395
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,285
Is that from the machine
that was in your office?

396
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,920
Mm-hmm.

397
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,288
I thought that
was the incentive prize

398
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,422
for the top sales person.

399
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,024
Very easy to clean.

400
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,625
Okay.

401
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,062
Like he's gonna
win anyway.

402
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,997
(SNICKERS)
Right?

403
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,104
So did we get any mail?

404
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,705
Yeah, I gave it to you.

405
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,574
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

406
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,077
Just checking.
Just checking, double checking.

407
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,144
Checking on the check.

408
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:15,415
Thoroughness is very
important in an office, and--

409
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,549
So can I--

410
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,617
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,952
Of course.

412
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,220
Uh, Pam, one more thing.

413
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,522
Um, how do girls your age
feel about futons?

414
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,292
A futon?

415
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,060
He's a grown man.

416
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,428
That's what he said.

417
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,197
That's sad.

418
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,264
Or it's innovative.

419
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,399
Well, you know,
the futon

420
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,502
is a bed and couch
all rolled into one.

421
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,503
What's up?

422
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,638
Hi.

423
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,573
Are you still
mad at me?

424
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,641
Roy...

425
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,976
Come on.
Cut it out.

426
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,144
Come on,
are you mad at me?

427
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,079
Stop it!
Are you still
mad at me now?

428
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,447
Cut it out.
Are you mad at me now?

429
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,515
(LAUGHING)
Stop!
Huh?

430
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,617
(LAUGHING)
Huh?
Come on.

431
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,086
Come on, Pammy.
Stop, I can't breathe.

432
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,687
I was just kidding.
You know I didn't mean it.

433
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,089
(PAM LAUGHING)

434
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,057
PAM:
Jim's a great guy.

435
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,525
He's like a brother to me.

436
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,693
We're, like,
best friends in the office.

437
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,997
And I really hope
he finds someone.

438
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,033
You seem to like
to touch things.

439
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,400
You should
try the velvet.

440
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,103
I don't like
to necessarily touch things.

441
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,140
I'm just--
I'm shopping.

442
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,576
Oh, no,
it's fine that you--

443
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,112
Here, what about
the raspberry one?

444
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,714
It's really, um,
kind of festive.

445
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,550
It's got a lot
of personality.

446
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,185
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.

447
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,120
Good, could I talk to you
for a second, in private?

448
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,189
I don't think so.
I'm really busy.

449
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,157
It'll just take a second.
I can't.

450
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,724
Just for a minute.
Please?
I really can't.

451
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,626
I wanted to talk to you
in private because

452
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,097
I wanted to ask you
out on a date.

453
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,431
No.

454
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,109
Okay, was that "no"
to talking to me in private

455
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,344
or was that "no" to the date?

456
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,213
Both.

457
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,520
What colors
do you like?

458
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,324
WOMAN:
Gray, dark gray, charcoal.

459
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,260
Brian...
Yeah?

460
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,296
Would you like to help me
with a special project?

461
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,198
I would love to.
Well, all right.

462
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,234
Okay, just throw out
all the empties.

463
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,302
You don't want
to recycle them?

464
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,570
Um...yes.

465
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,773
Throw them away
in the recycling bin.

466
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,542
Do you want this?

467
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,579
No.

468
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,315
What about this bottle
of power drink?

469
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,416
Uh, what flavor?

470
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,450
Blue.

471
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,484
Blue's not a flavor.

472
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,186
It says,
"FLAVOR: Blue Blast."

473
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,188
Oh, Blue Blast, yes.
Put that in the trunk.

474
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,557
And there should be an unopened
Arctic Chill back there.

475
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,626
I want that
in the passenger's cup holder.

476
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,161
Thank you.

477
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,205
Hi.
Hi.

478
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,673
I'm Jim, by the way.
I'm Katy.

479
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,175
Hi, Katy,
nice to meet you.

480
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,309
You sit out there,
don't you?
I do.

481
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,344
That's what
I'm best known for.

482
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,279
(LAUGHS)
Sitting out there.

483
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,348
All right,
let's talk about purses.

484
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,615
Okay, um--

485
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,217
Katy, but,
you know what?

486
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,418
Don't try to sell me one.

487
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,187
Okay, seriously.

488
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,122
'Cause I'm just here
to learn.

489
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,089
Okay.

490
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,325
So I know about
most of these, but--
Okay.

491
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,895
Whoa, stop! Whoa!
That's my Drakkar Noir.

492
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,564
No, this says
Rite Aid "Night Swept."

493
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,299
No, it is a perfect
smell-alike.

494
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,267
I'm not paying
for the label.

495
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,368
Right here, give it.

496
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,702
It's empty.
No, it's not.

497
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,404
There's some
in the straw.

498
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,842
There.
Now you may throw it out.

499
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,514
Wow.

500
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,649
How many Filet-O-Fishes
did you eat?

501
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,352
That's over
several months, Ryan.

502
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,222
Still...

503
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,256
What's up?

504
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,291
I'm bored.

505
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,260
Thank you
for choosing me.

506
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,161
No, I'm kidding.

507
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:51,198
Um, so you got
big plans this weekend?

508
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,667
Uh...well, I think
I'm gonna see Katy.

509
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,236
Really?

510
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,604
Yeah.

511
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,705
What are you guys
gonna do?

512
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,308
Oh, man, I don't know.

513
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,311
Uh, dinner,
drinks, movie...

514
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,813
matching tattoos.

515
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,215
That's great.
Big stuff.

516
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,316
That's, mmm.
Yeah.

517
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,184
What are you doing?

518
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,320
I was gonna say
I think that, um...

519
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,188
we're gonna
help Roy's cousin move.

520
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,358
Okay.
'Cause Roy's got a truck.

521
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,592
That's cool.

522
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,860
Uh-huh.

523
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,295
Yes.

524
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,596
That is cool.

525
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,265
But I'll see you
Monday, though, right?

526
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,366
Great.

527
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,235
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna head back.

528
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,336
All right.

529
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,710
I think, in order
to be a ladies' man,

530
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,513
it's imperative that people
don't know you're a ladies' man.

531
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,582
So I kind of play that
close to the chest.

532
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,753
I don't know, what can I say?
Women are attracted to power.

533
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,222
And I think...

534
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,958
other people have told me
I have a very symmetrical face.

535
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,964
I don't know.
I don't know.

536
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,401
Maybe they're right.
I don't know.

537
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,746
MICHAEL:
Sure you don't want me
to help you with that?

538
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,315
'Cause I can grab that,
no problem.

539
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,749
KATY:
It was nice to meet
some of you.

540
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,819
See ya later!
Good night!

541
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,588
Good night, Jim.

542
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:22,822
Good night, Michael.

543
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,724
Where you going?

544
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,360
I don't know.
Grab a drink, I think.

545
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,462
With us?

546
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:32,365
I, um, I probably
should have told you,

547
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,366
I don't need a ride now

548
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,767
'cause Jim can
take me home after.

549
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,369
So you're off the hook.

550
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,337
Okay, great, off the hook.
Excellent.

551
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,339
Okay, cool.
JIM:
I got this.

552
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,642
Have fun.
Don't drink and drive.

553
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,910
Take it easy.

554
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,011
Have a good night.
You too.

555
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,446
Have a good night!
You got that?

556
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,714
Oh, yeah.

557
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,849
You sold a lot,
so it's lighter.

558
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,451
I bet.

559
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,885
Well, here...

560
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,388
(CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)

561
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,357
(ENGINE STARTS)

562
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,392
All right, now,
I'm gonna warn you.

563
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,860
Don't freak out, okay?
Why?

564
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,362
This is a really nice car.

565
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,964
In case you haven't noticed,
this is a Corolla, okay?

566
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,899
It's a very nice car.

567
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,535
So you're not
gonna freak out?

568
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,504
Do I have
a special someone?

569
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:14,006
Uh, well, yeah,
of course.

570
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,475
A bunch of 'em.

571
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,744
My employees.

572
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,912
If I had to choose between
a one-night-stand

573
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,981
with some stupid cow
I pick up at a bar

574
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,383
and these people,

575
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,384
I'd pick them every time.

576
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:28,788
Because with them,
it is an every day stand.

577
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,823
And I still know
their names in the morning.
