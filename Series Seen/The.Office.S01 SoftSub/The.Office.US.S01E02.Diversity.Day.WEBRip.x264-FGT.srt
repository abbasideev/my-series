Hey, can I, uh,
help you out here?

3
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,380
Oh, I'm all set.
Thanks.

4
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,110
Gotcha.

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,810
Good.

6
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,780
Go with the rose.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,710
That's a good idea.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,180
Today is Diversity Day.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,400
And someone's gonna come in
and talk to us about diversity.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,900
It's something that
I've been pushing,

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,100
that I've been wanting
to push for a long time.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,000
And corporate mandated it.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,870
And I, I never actually
talked to corporate about it.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,140
Um, they kind of
beat me to the punch.

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,120
Uh, those bastards.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,780
Um, but-- but I was going to.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,730
And I think it's very
important that we have this.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,200
And I'm very, very excited.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,980
That's the thing.

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,360
It's very sturdy paper.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,550
And on the back it says
100% post consumer content.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,250
So.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,680
What?

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,740
Hello?

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,010
Uh huh.

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,100
Wait, what?
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,530
Mr. Deckard, I think
I'm, I think I'm

Do you really have
to do that right now?

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,480
Yes, I do.

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,980
I should have done this
weeks ago, actually.

37
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,330
Mr. Deckard.
I'm sorry about that.

38
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,790
What were you-- can
you hold on one second?

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,490
Yeah.

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,570

Thanks.

Dit for tit.

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,800
That is not the expression.

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,720
Well, it should be.

This is my biggest

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,160
They love me over
there for some reason.

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,490
I'm not really sure why.

55
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,640
But, uh, you know, I make one
call over there every year just

56

to renew their account.

57
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,760

And I promise this
will be quick.

105
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,480
At Diversity Today our
philosophy is about honesty

106
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,440
and positive expectations.

107
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,080
We believe that 99% of the
problems in the workplace

108
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,720
arise simply out of ignorance.
-You know what?

109
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,060
This is a colour free zone here.

110
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,040
Stanley, I don't look
at you as another race.

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,890
Uh, see, that, this is
what I'm talking about.

112
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,550
We don't have to pretend
that we're colour blind.

113
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,250
Exactly.

114
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,720
That's fighting ignorance
with more ignorance.

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,630
--more tolerance.

116
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,020
-No, with more ignorance.
-Ignorance.

117
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,720
Right.

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,670
Exactly.

119
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,680
Uh, instead we need to
celebrate our diversity.

120
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,970
-Let's celebrate.
-OK?

121
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,960
Right.
OK.

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
Celebrate good times.

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,260
Come on!

124
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,940
Let's celebrate diversity.
Right?

125
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,050
Yes, exactly.

126
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,710
Now here's what
we're going to do.

127
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,370
Uh, I've noticed that, uh--
-You know what?

128
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,510
Here's what we're going to do.

129
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:49,150
Why don't we go around and
everybody, everybody say a race

130
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,660
that you are
attracted to sexually.

131
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,320
I will go last.
Go.

132
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,790
I have two.
MICHAEL: Nice.

133
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,020
White and Indian.

134
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,500
MR. BROWN: Actually, I
prefer not to start that way.

135
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,480
Michael, uh, I would love
to have your permission

136
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,190
to run this session.

137
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,060
Can I have your permission?
-Yes.

138
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,680
Thank you very much
and it would also

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,790
help me if you were seated.

140
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,540
OK.

141
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,110
Thank you.

142
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,020
OK.

143
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060
Now at the start
of the session I

144
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,910
had you write down an
incident that you found

145
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,500
offensive in the workplace.

146
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,920
Now what I'm going
to do is choose one,

147
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,480
and we're gonna act it out.

148
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,980
A few of the ground
rules, just real quick--

149
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,180
Hey, hey, why don't you run it
by me and I'll run it by him.

150
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,880
OK.

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,300
Can we steer away
from gay people?

152
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,490
Uh.
DWIGHT: I'm sorry.

153
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,390
It's an orientation.

154
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,430
It's not a race.

155
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,700
Plus a lot of other races are
also intolerant of gays, so.

156
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,400
Paradox.

157
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,670
MR. BROWN: Well, we
only have an hour.

158
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,350
DWIGHT: Save time.

159
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,980
Why don't we just
differ to Mr. um?

160
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,840
Mr. Brown.

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
Ah.

162
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,490
Oh, all right.
OK.

163
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,270
First test.

164
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,570
I will not call you that.

165
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,350
Well, it's my name.

166
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,080
It's not a test.

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,170
OK?

168
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,250
Um, so looking through the cards
I've noticed that many of you

169
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,030
wrote down the same
incident, which is ironic

170
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,340
because it's the
exact incident I was

171
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,690
brought in here to respond to.

172
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,250
Now how many of you are familiar
with the Chris Rock routine?

173
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,290
Very good.
OK.

174
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,690
How come Chris Rock can
do a routine and everybody

175
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,660
finds it hilarious
and groundbreaking.

176
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,020
And then I go and do
the exact same routine,

177
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,310
same comedic timing.

178
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,480
And people file a
complaint to corporate?

179
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Is it because I'm white
and Chris is black?

180
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,460
So we're going to reenact this
with a more positive outcome.

181
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,160
I will play the Chris Rock guy.

182
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,980
(GROANING)

183
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,610
I would like to see
someone else pull this off.

184
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,900
Well, let's have
someone who wasn't

185
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,400
involved do the reenactment.

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,220
OK.

187
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,790
I will play guy listening.
-Great.

188
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,220
Guy listening.
OK.

189
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,620
Uh, anyone else remember?

190
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,100
KEVIN: I remember.
MR. BROWN: Great.

191
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,110
You're the Chris Rock guy.

192
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,320
And you're guy listening.

193
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,060
OK.

194
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,400
Kevin is a great guy.

195
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,840
He's a great accountant.

196
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,830
He is not much of
an entertainer.

197
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,190
Basically there are two
types of black people.

198
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,270
And black people are actually
more racist because they hate

199
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,180
the other type of black people.

200
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,450
See, every time
the one type wants

201
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,960
to have a good time then
the other type comes in

202
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,210
and makes a real mess.
-OK.

203
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm, I'm sorry.

204
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,060
I'm sorry.

205
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,130
He's ruin-- he's butchering it.

206
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,410
I'm-- could you just let me.

207
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,360
Every time, every time
black people wanna

208
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,910
have a good time, some (BLEEP).

209
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,950
I take care of my kids.

210
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,090
(BLEEP)
-Wait, wait.

211
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,440
You don't need to do that.
That's-- please stop it.

212
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,140
Stop it--

213
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,190
Always want credit for
something they supposed to do.

214
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,890
MR. BROWN: Stop it!

215
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,920
What you want?
A cookie?

216
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,980
(PHONE RINGING)

217
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,830
MR. BROWN: Now this
is a simple acronym.

218
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,330
Hero.

219
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,330
At Diversity Today we believe
it's very easy to be a hero.

220
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,720
All you need are
honesty, empathy,

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,550
respect, and open-mindedness.

222
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,110
DWIGHT: Uh, excuse me.
-Yeah?

223
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,110
DWIGHT: I'm sorry, but that's
not all it takes to be a hero.

224
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,380
OK.
Well, what is a hero to you?

225
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,470
A hero kills people,
people that wish him harm.

226
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,760
MR. BROWN: OK.

227
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,770
A hero is part human,
a part supernatural.

228
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,930
A hero is born out
of a childhood trauma

229
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,220
or out of a disaster
that must be avenged.

230
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,720
OK, um, you're
thinking of a superhero.

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,120
We all have hero in our heart.

232
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,880
MR. BROWN: Now I need
you to take these forms.

233
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,680
This is, it kind of expresses
the joint experience, uh, we

234
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,420
had today.

235
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,790
And I want you to look
them over and sign

236
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,890
them as kind of a group pledge.

237
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,440
(CLEARS THROAT)

238
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,960
I don't think I can sign this.

239
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,150
Um, I can't leave until you do.

240
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,300
Well, OK.

241
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,940
I, it says here that
I learned something.

242
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,660
And I knew all
this stuff already.

243
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,220
So I could-- you know, I
could sign something that

244
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,830
says that I taught something.

245
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,180
Or that I helped
you teach something.

246
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,050
So, Pam?

247
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,890
Where is she?

248
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,040
Pam, could we change
something on this?

249
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,730
Um, Michael, can I-- can
I talk to you candidly?

250
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,430
Sure.

251
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,190
MR. BROWN: We both know that I
am here because of the comments

252
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,970
that you made.

253
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,130
Here's the thing,
this office, I

254
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,800
think is very advanced in
terms of racial awareness.

255
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,970
And, uh, it's probably more
advanced than you're used to.

256
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,670
Um.

257
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,100
That's probably throwing
you off a little.

258
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,000
It's not throwing me.

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,420
I need your signature.
-OK.

260
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,100
Well, I know.
You told me that. several times.

261
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,670
MR. BROWN: Yes, but you're
not listening to me.

262
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,610
Yours is the only
signature I need.

263
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,370
Oh, OK.

264
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,490
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices

265
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,300
to put you through this seminar
for the comments that you made.

266
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,160
And the only reason why I
make copies for everyone

267
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,490
was so that you
wouldn't be embarrassed.

268
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,730
Well, here I am thinking
that you actually

269
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,000
cared about diversity training.

270
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,430
And you don't.

271
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,400
-Don't worry about dating.
-All right.

272
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,100
Well.

273
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,520
OK.
Thank you.

274
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,220
Yeah.

275
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,470
I regret my actions.

276
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,570
I regret offending my coworkers.

277
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,020
I pledge to bring my best
spirit of honesty, empathy,

278
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,490
respect, and open-mindedness--
open-mindedness,

279
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,020
is that even a word?

280
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,960
Um, into the workplace.

281
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,670
In this way I can
truly be a hero.

282
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,010
Signed Daffy Duck.

283
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,870
(LAUGHS)

284
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,550
He's gonna lose it
when he reads that.

285
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,990
Yeah, hi.
Is Mr. Deckard around?

286
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,450
Oh, well, could you just
have him call me after lunch?

287
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,150
Thank you.

288
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:41,250
I pledge to always keep an
open mind and an open heart.

289
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,660
I do believe in that part of
the pledge that I just read.

290
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,200
But a pledge?
Come on.

291
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000
I mean, who are we?
The Girl Scouts?

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,020
No.

293
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,360
Look, the, um, the
guy, Mr. Brown,

294
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,070
uh, he got us halfway there.

295
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,040
He got us talking.
Well, no.

296
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,410
I got us talking.

297
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,630
He got us nothing.

298
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,720
He insulted us.

299
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,200
And then he abandoned us.

300
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,930
You call that
diversity training?

301
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,290
I don't.

302
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,930
Were there any connections
between any of us?

303
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,740
Did anyone look each
other in the eye?

304
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,100
Was there any emotion going on?

305
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,090
Were-- no.

306
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,570
Where was the heart?

307
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,490
I didn't see any heart.

308
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,310
Where was my Oprah moment?

309
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,410
OK.

310
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,930
Get as much done as you
can before lunch because,

311
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,740
uh, afterward I'm going
to have you all in tears.

(DIAL TONE RINGING)

313
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
All right.
Everybody pretty?

314
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
Come on.
Here we go.

315
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,800
It's time.

316
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Let's do some good.

317
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,170
Hey, we're not all gonna sit in
a circle Indian style, are we?

318
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,230
(LAUGHTER)

319
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,950
Get out.

320
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,850
-Sorry.
-No.

321
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,800
This is not a joke.

322
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,690
OK?

323
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,540
That was offensive.

324
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,620
And lame.

325
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,200
So double offensive.

326
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,640
This is an environment
of welcoming.

327
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,580
And you should just get
the hell out of here.

328
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,110
OK.
Let's go.

329
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,230
Let's do it.
Come on.

330
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,100
Let's have some fun everybody.

331
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,390
Here we go.

332
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,370
Take a seat.

333
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,170
Cop a squat.

334
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,890
And, um, thank
you for coming in.

335
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:37,190
Um, diversity is the
cornerstone of progress,

336
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,700
as I've always said.

337
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,680
But don't take my word for it.

338
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,710
Let's take look at the tape.

339
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,490
Hi.
I'm Michael Scott.

340
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,650
I'm in charge of Dunder
Mifflin Paper Products

341
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,460
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

342
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,570
But I'm also the founder
of Diversity Tomorrow

343
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,610
because today is almost over.

344
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,830
Abraham Lincoln once said
that if you're a racist,

345
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,120
I will attack you
with the north.

346
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,550
And those are the
principles that I

347
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,040
carry with me in the workplace.

348
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,750
OK.

349
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,490
Questions?

350
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,080
Comments?
Anybody?

351
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,340
Jim?
-Uh, is that it?

352
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,130
Uh, yes.

353
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,470
I only had an hour
to put it together,

354
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,390
but I'm gonna add
on to it later on.

355
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,820
It was kind of hard to hear.

356
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,300
Uh, yes.

357
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,260
That probably had something
to do with the camera work.

358
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,160
Anybody else?

359
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Um.

360
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,740
I have a customer meeting.

361
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,540
Yeah, well, if you leave
we'll only have two left.

362
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,470
Yes.

363
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,470
Enjoy.

364
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,270
Absolutely.

365
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,870
Namaste.
OK.

366
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,580
Well, since I am leading this,
let's get down to business.

367
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,700
And why don't I just
kind of introduce myself.

368
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,980
OK?

369
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,460
Um, I am Michael.

370
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,510
And I am part English,
Irish, German, and Scottish.

371
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,680
Sort of a virtual
United Nations.

372
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,550
But what some of
you might not know

373
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,370
is that I am also part
Native American Indian.

374
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,910
What part Native American?

375
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,420
2/15.

376
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,300
2/15?

377
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,880
That fraction doesn't
make any sense.

378
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,710
Well, you know what?

379
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,010
It's kind of hard
for me to talk about.

380
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,570
There's suffering.
So who else?

381
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,160
Let's get this popping.
Come on.

382
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,130
Who's going?
Who's going?

383
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,670
Uh, let's go here.
Oscar.

384
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,250
Right here.

385
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,010
You're on.

386
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,200
OK, Michael.

387
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,430
Uh, both my parents
were born in Mexico.

388
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,200
Oh, yeah.

389
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,250
And, uh, they moved
to the United States

390
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,700
a year before I was born.

391
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,530
MICHAEL: Yeah.

392
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,610
So I grew up in
the United States

393
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,810
and my parents were Mexican.
-Wow.

394
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,750
That is, that is a great story.

395
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,440
That's the American
dream right there, right?

396
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,570
Thank you.
Yeah.

397
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,140
Um, let me ask you, is
there a term besides Mexican

398
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,910
that you prefer?

399
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,000
Something less offensive?

400
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,150
Mexican isn't offensive.

401
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,660
Well, it has
certain connotations.

402
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,770
Like what?

403
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,320
Like, I don't--
well, I don't know.

404
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,390
But what connotations, Michael?

405
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,890
-No, no, no.
-You must have meant something.

406
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,360
MICHAEL: No.
Now remember--

407
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,260
I'm just curious.

408
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,660
Honesty.
OSCAR: Yeah.

409
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,280
Um, empathy,
(PHONE RINGING)

410
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,330
Respect.

411
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,390
Jim?

412
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,780
Jim?

413
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,540
Hello?

414
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,990
Hello?

415
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,470
I have something here.

416
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,580
I want you to take a card,
put it on your fore--

417
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,130
don't look at the card.

418
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,060
I want you to take the card.

419
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,090
And I want you to put
it on your forehead.

420
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,710
And take a card.

421
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,040
Take a card, any card.

422
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,930
Um, and I want you to treat
other people like the race

423
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,750
that is on their forehead.

424
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,610
OK?

425
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,530
So everybody has
a different race.

426
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,190
Nobody knows what their race is.

427
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,740
So I want you to really go
for it because this is real.

428
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,220
You know, this isn't
just an exercise.

429
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,400
This is real life.

430
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,890
And I have a dream that you
will really let the sparks fly.

431
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,960
Get er done.
Why?

432
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,270
Because Martin Luther
King is a hero of mine.

433
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,920
There's this great
Chris Rock bit

434
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,190
about how streets named
after Martin Luther

435
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,100
King tend to be more violent.

436
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm not going to
do it, but it's--

437
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,820
-Oh, this is a good one.
-Um, hi.

438
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,580
How are you?
-Fine.

439
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,750
How are you?
-Great.

440
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,480
MICHAEL: Push it, Pam.

441
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,070
Push it.
-Um,

442
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,320
I admire your culture's
success in America.

443
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,020
Thank you.

444
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,920
MICHAEL: Good.

445
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,970
Bum-ba-bum-bum.
Come on.

446
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,240
Olympics of
suffering right here.

447
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,570
Slavery versus the Holocaust.

448
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,460
Come on.

449
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,870
So what am I supposed to be?

450
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,710
It's gonna percolate.

451
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,410
No, no, no.

452
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,620
Well, that, that
was inadvertent.

453
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,770
We didn't actually plan that.

454
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,460
Lots of cultures eat rice.

455
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,190
That doesn't help me.

456
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,440
Um, shalom.

457
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,080
I'd like to apply for a loan.

458
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,030
That's nice, Dwight.

459
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,730
OK, do me.

460
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,830
Something stereotypical so
I can get it really quick.

461
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,480
OK.
I like your food.

462
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,420
Uh, Outback Steakhouse.

463
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,010
I'm Australian, mate.
-No.

464
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,600
Pam, come on.

465
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,810
I like your food.
No.

466
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,240
Come on.
Stir the pot.

467
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,980
Stir the melting pot, Pam.
Let's do it.

468
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,730
Let's get ugly.

469
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,470
Let's get real.

470
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,170
OK.

471
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,830
If I have to do this based on
stereotypes that are totally

472
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,780
untrue, that I do
not agree with,

473
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,990
you would maybe not
be a very good driver.

474
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,690
Oh, man.

475
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,120
Am I a woman?

476
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,420
You'll notice I didn't
have anybody be an Arab.

477
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,240
I thought that would
be too explosive.

478
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,050
Uh, no pun intended.

479
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,200
But I just thought
too soon for Arabs.

480
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,860
Maybe next year.

481
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,200
Um.

482
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,660
You know, the ball's
in their court.

483
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,390
What are you watching?

484
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,090
"Chappelle's Show."

485
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,490
-Really?
-Yeah.

486
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,280
I downloaded it on her computer.
I hope she doesn't mind.

487
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,000
She just had a lot
of extra space.

488
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,760
No way.
No.

489
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,960
I think she really
likes this stuff.

490
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,350
Great.

491
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,670
She's cute, huh?

492
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah.

493
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,700
You know, she's engaged, but

494
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,400
Oh, no.

495
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,530
The girl on the sketch.

496
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,960
Oh, yeah.
She's hot.

497
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,180
Yeah.

498
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,670
Hey.

499
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,160
Hey.

500
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,910
You want to go to the beach?

501
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,300
Sure.

502
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,670
You want to get high?

503
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,810
No.

504
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,190
-I think you do, mon.
-Stop it.

505
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,290
OK.
All right.

506
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,690
No.
It's good.

507
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,370
It-- you just, you,
you need to push it.

508
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,580
You know, you need to
go a little bit further.

509
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,790
Uh, all right.

510
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,760
OK.

511
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,940
(INDIAN ACCENT):
Kelly, how are you?

512
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,350
I just had the longest meeting.

513
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,930
Oh, welcome to my
convenient store.

514
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,440
Would you like
some cookie cookie?

515
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Oh, I have some very
delicious cookie cookie.

516
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,560
Only $0.99 plus tax.

517
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,890
Try my cookie cookie.

518
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,090
Try my cookie cookie.

519
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,080
Try my cookie cookie.

520
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,070
Try my--

521
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,720
All right.

522
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,280
All right.

523
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,720
Yes.

524
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,140
That was great.

525
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,580
She gets it.

526
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,010
Now she knows what it's
like to be a minority.

527
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,810
Mr. Deckard, we didn't lose
your sale today, did we?

528
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,380
Excellent.
OK.

529
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,470
Let me just get
your-- what's that?

530
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,720
No.
We didn't.

531
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,010
We didn't close last time.

532
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,600
I just need your, uh-- oh.

533
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,670
What, what code were you given?

534
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,590
Oh, OK.

535
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,290
Yeah, no.

536
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,640
That's actually
another salesman here.

537
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,340
Yeah.

538
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,670
I can redo it if
you want to do that.

539
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,060
Oh, he gave you a discount.

540
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,890
No, I don't blame you.

541
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,580
I just hated it when
that guy was in here.

542
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,090
Mr. Brown, if that
was his real name.

543
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,380
I mean, he had never
met any of us before.

544
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,510
And here he was telling
us how to do our thing.

545
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,060
I just want-- I just
wanted to do it our way.

546
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,670
You know?
On our own.

547
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,340
Man, I should have
gotten some food.

548
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,820
Maybe some spaghetti?

549
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,520
MICHAEL: OK, Kevin.

550
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,170
You can take off that thing.

551
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,310
OK?

552
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:06,560
That would have really, really
shown him up, wouldn't it?

553
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,110
If I had brought in some
burritos or some coloured

554
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,220
greens, or some pad thai.

555
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,370
Love pad thai.

556
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,650
STANLEY: It's collared greens.
MICHAEL: What?

557
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,810
It's collared greens.

558
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,860
That doesn't really make
sense because you don't

559
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,870
call them collared people.
That's offensive.

560
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,660
Hmm.
OK.

561
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,010
Well, it's after 5:00.

562
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,280
So thank you very much.

563
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,500
Buena vista, Oscar.

564
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,950
Thank you.

565
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,120
Good job.

566
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,370
Ah, my man.

567
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,380
Thank you, Brazil.
Nice.

568
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,460
Hey.

569
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Hey.

570
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,210
We can go.
-Sorry.

571
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,130
-That's fine.
-OK.

572
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,310
Uh, not a bad day.
