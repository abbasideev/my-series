What is in the pouch?

537
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:05,520
Something very important to me.

538
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:07,448
It's the only thing I have
left of my father.

539
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:10,201
- My only connection to him. It's...
- Okay.

540
00:45:10,202 --> 00:45:12,690
It's irreplaceable! We have
to find out where it went.

541

We have to get it back.

Don't ask me to say anything

My love, we are unarmed.

Whoever came last night may return.

548
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,059
And the Witchfinder
lurks out there somewhere.

549

If we remain too long, he will find us.

550
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,480
Then we must hurry.

551
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,198
My father, my relationship
with him is not something

I know how to talk about.

553
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:46,570
It's complicated.

think you would understand.

from you has been to protect us.

I know.

562
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:20,897
What could possibly be so important
and still you'll not say it?

563
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:23,882
- [HANIWA] I'll do it.
- [KOFUN] No.

564
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:25,861
Haniwa.

565
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:28,530
[HANIWA] She already knows
everything you're asking.

566
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:30,411
I'll find it for you.

567
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:33,760
If it were river bandits,
they're half a day away.

568
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:35,870
If it was the Opayol, there
could be hundreds of them.

569
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:37,705
A hundred of them won't see me coming.

570
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:40,459
Do you know how fortunate we
were to escape the Witchfinder?

571
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:42,752
Very fortunate.

572
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:44,754
Another fight and now without arms?

573
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:47,174
I'm not suggesting we
get into a fight, Papa.

Whoever took it...

575
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:52,136
how can they fight me if they
don't even know that I'm there?

576
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:54,738
And besides, we don't know who they are.

577
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:57,225
- We should at least try to figure out...
- I think I know.

578
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:02,481
- What?
- I think I know who took our things.

579
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,568
- What are you talking about?
- Look, please.

580
00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:12,115
What is it? What do you see?

581
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,632
Tell me. What is it?
