00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,378
- Maghra!
- [soldiers grunt]

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:04,838
Did you find Mom?

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,715
She was taken before their leader.

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,843
I saw her die.

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,094
I went to look for her.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,639
I found this. We must go.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,933
I know a place we can hide safely.
Follow me.

8
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>Nobody will find us here.
It's a cave, well hidden.</i>

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,604
[Boots] <i>We've arrived.</i>

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,731
- [Baba Voss] Boots!
- [Haniwa] Open this gate!

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,650
Open this gate!

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,987
[grunting]

13
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:29,947
No!

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,992
[Cutter] <i>I heard that when
a Payan monarch ascends the throne...</i>

[screams]

16
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>...an amulet is embedded
just above the heart.</i>

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,165
[Maghra] <i>How could someone
have kidnapped the queen?</i>

18
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,293
I am the only one here who can help you.

19
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,712
I know who has your sister.

20
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,557
[birds tweeting]

00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,244

[grunts, whimpers]

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,007
[Tamacti Jun]
Dorian the Elder once said...

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,970
"The most unsettling sound
in the human experience is silence...

42
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,181
when nature begs for wailing."

43
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:08,480
Silence in a birth, silence in a moment
of devastating heartbreak.

44
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:13,152
Silence during the infliction
of such extreme pain.

45
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,450
[breathes raggedly]

46
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,828
You've done yourself proud.

47
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,665
Your defiance is powerful.

48
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,754
Some men in my position
might find themselves affected by it...

49
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:37,968
suddenly fighting the onset of pity,
their resolve weakened...

50
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,180
and so on, and so on.

51
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,017
Just to be clear, those men are cowards.

52
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,022
There's a reason why I am
in this position, and they aren't.

53
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,651
And eight fingers from now...

54
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,530
we start on toes.

55
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,781
[cries]

56
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,324

00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,992
[sobs]

58
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:07,206
I will do this for days
until you tell me where my queen is.

59
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,106
I have the destination
where the queen is being held.

60
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,358
They won't be expecting us.

61
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,485
It's days from here at a quick pace.

62
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,238
The company is already preparing
to depart.

63
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,700
There's only a few things
that we need to resolve before then.

64
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,784
"Resolve"?

65
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:46,662
First, the boy.

66
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,584
I'm grateful he aided in the capture
of the two Shadows out there.

67
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,253
Now...

68
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,425
I'd like to know how he did it.

69
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,888
He's not your son.

70
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,183
That much was clear
the moment he was brought to you.

71
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,313
But he has vision too, doesn't he?

72
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,317
Yes.

73
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,155
Another child of Jerlamarel's...

74
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,327
with another woman.

75
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,957
You deserved more than that.

76
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,711
None of that is the boy's fault,
and you'd be nowhere without him.

77
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,632
I'm the Witchfinder, Maghra, and there
is one sitting in my tent as we speak!

78
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,718
Fault has nothing to do with it.
I can't simply ignore who he is.

79
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,136
Of course you can!

80
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,680
He's with me.

81
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,768
He has my protection.
And I'm the daughter of the king.

82
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,021
What else do you wanna resolve?

83
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,525
Whether he comes with us.

84
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,401
[Maghra] "Comes with us"?

85
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,904
I'm moving this army.
I cannot leave you behind.

86
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,115
Absolutely not.
I am not leaving until my family is found.

87
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,284
It's been days,
and my scouts have found no signs of them.

88
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,787
- You promised me!
- I promised to search.

89
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,830
And from where I stand,
that promise is kept.

90
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,166
Well, then you leave some of your men
behind. I will continue to search.

91
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,627
I have no choice in this matter,
and neither do you.

92
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,003
[cot creaking]

93
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,047
Boy...

94
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:28,347
I have forgotten more about killing
than you will ever know.

95
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:33,811
If you think because you have sight
that that will even the odds between us...

96
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,814
think again.

97
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,363
It's all right.

98
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,704
This place is uninhabited.
There's little danger here.

99
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,831
Just a few men could guarantee my safety.

100
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,460
Maghra, the queen is compromised.

101
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,797
She may be incapacitated. She may be dead.

102
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,258
We don't know
who is governing the kingdom.

103
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,052
We don't know
if anyone is governing the kingdom.

104
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:11,223
The chaos that preceded your family's rule
was dire.

105
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,394
Countless rivalries,
grievances and vendettas.

106
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,315
Without a Kane on the throne to rule,
they will rear their heads again.

107
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:23,694
And you are rightfully the next Kane
in the line of succession.

108
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:30,659
I will leave a contingent behind
to continue looking for your family.

109
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,121
But as far as your presence goes...

110
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,751
this isn't a choice for either of us.

111
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,927
[horses snorting, whinnying]

112
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,101
[Maghra]
You're in command of the men left behind?

113
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,270
[soldier]
Yes, Your Highness. Four men under me.

114
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,481
Eight would be better.

115
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,441
Do it.

116
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,530
You understand how important
your charge here is, yes?

117
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,114
Yes, ma'am, of course.

118
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,742
They're my life.

119
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,327
[soldier] Yes, ma'am.

120
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,180
You must talk to your father.

121
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,849
He doesn't wanna hear anything
I have to say.

122
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,018
That is why you must talk to him.

123
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,355
Why me?

124
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:27,860
Haniwa,
it doesn't matter who speaks first.

125
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,778
It is the way forward.

126
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,158
You think it's simple.

127
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,285
It is.

128
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,288
Break this silence while you can.

129
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,465
Why are we stopping?

130
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,970
We'll camp here for the night.
Your father's gone ahead, scouting.

131
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,268
[Baba Voss] How far off is it?

132
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,395
How far is what?

133
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,397
[Baba Voss sniffs]

134
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:06,649
Oh, wow.

135
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:21,705
I can't tell if I'm relieved
or if I was hoping we'd never find it.

136
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,170
I'll go tell the others.

137
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,220
[coughs, clears throat]

138
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,349
[grunts]

139
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,442
[dogs panting]

140
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,866
[Maghra] How does a queen
who never leaves her palace

141
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,120
end up by the side of the road with
nothing but a handmaiden and a driver?

142
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,331
You think someone attempted
to move against her?

143
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,460
I could imagine a number of things.

144
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,505
I'm trying not to.

145
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,174
She had enemies.

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,218
Comes with the crown.

147
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,762
More for some than others.

148
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,766
She's my mother. You know that, don't you?

149
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:29,356
Their faces, their voices,
the way they breathed, even.

150
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,404
I was so young when my mother died,
but even then I knew it.

151
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,074
The two of them were exactly the same.

152
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,245
So when she died,

153
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:48,709
it felt especially cruel
that every time my sister was nearby...

154
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:54,298
to hear her, to smell her, to touch her...

155
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,887
suddenly,
I'd be mourning my mother all over again.

156
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,142
I imagine it was no different
to my father.

157
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:09,522
I imagine that's why he could never
bring himself to take away the one thing

158
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,233
she treasured above all else:

159
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,739
her birthright.

160
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,893
[Cora]
I brought food for her, as you asked.

161
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:54,233
[Cutter] You can call her what she is.
There is no power or magic in it here.

162
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,320
I brought food for the queen,
as you asked.

163
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,446
Very well.

164
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,125
[clattering]

165
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,670
Still not up to your standards, huh?

166
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:22,011
I had heard stories of your stubbornness,
your self-destructiveness, even.

167
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:27,057
When I first heard them, they seemed
outlandish to me, not to be trusted.

168
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,309
But now... [chuckles]

169
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:34,732
Perhaps you could confirm
or deny a few of them for me.

170
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,486
I heard you killed lovers
for snoring in their sleep.

171
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,032
Servants,
because you didn't like their smell.

172
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,702
You severed the tongues of young maiden

173
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,164
- [bells jingling]
- because they didn't... please you

174
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,166
fast enough.

175
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:58,589
Any of these you'd care to dispute,
or perhaps even claim credit for?

176
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,342
[shouts, grunts]

177
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,928
[exhales sharply]

178
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,013
[groans]

179
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,058
[shouts, gasps]

180
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,227
[groans, coughs]

181
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,563
You know the rules.

182
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:19,109
The bell rings, and how do we know
you aren't trying to escape?

183
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,238
The bell rings, and we must respond.

184
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:26,325
The bell rings,
and you will suffer for it.

185
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,409
[grunts]

186
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,287
Until your ransom is paid,

187
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,625
you are an asset
that I intend to be very careful with.

188
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,709
[coughs]

189
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,298
So why don't you just relax?

190
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,886
Let us continue our conversation,
shall we?

191
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:53,477
Please know, inasmuch as I found
those stories entertaining...

192
00:14:55,062 --> 00:15:00,067
the one that really interests me
involves a particular lover...

193
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,446
who broke your heart and then left you.

194
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,742
- [jingling]
- [grunting]

195
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,746
[staff tapping]

196
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,540
[whimpers]

197
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,334
[jingling continues]

198
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,419
[grunts]

199
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,796
- [blow lands]
- [grunts]

200
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:22,840
- [blow lands]
- [grunts]

201
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:37,104
[Paris humming]

202
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:27,404
- [Paris humming]
- [staff tapping]

203
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,202
[humming continues]

204
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,382
[humming stops]

205
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,554
[wind whistling]

206
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,891
[thunder rumbling]

207
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,563
[thunder rumbling]

208
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,610
Haniwa.

209
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,030
What I said before...

210
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,407
I know.

211
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,534
- It's just because...
- It's okay.

212
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,953
- In the cave...
- I understand.

213
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,414
You sure?

214
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,635
[wood clatters]

215
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,640
[Haniwa] Yeah.

216
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,230
[wind whistling, gusting]

217
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,196
[Haniwa]
What do you think we're headed towards?

218
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,286
Honestly, I think you need to manage
your expectations.

219
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,041
To set aside what we know of him, okay?

220
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,459
Set aside the fact
that he left his child to be abused

221
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,710
until he turned into a monster.

222
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,546
- We don't really know what actually happ...
- Mom didn't want this.

223
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,554
I have no memory of her talking about him
without sounding sad.

224
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:20,517
I have no memory of her talking about
any of this without warning us against it.

225
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,315
I mean, that has to have been
for a reason, Haniwa.

226
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,152
[thunder rumbles in distance]

227
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,785
Don't you think it's strange that
she never told us what that reason was?

228
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,166
I don't know...

229
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:48,671
what was... in Mama's head.

230
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:55,302
But I do know that she loved him.

231
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,474
And there must be a reason for that.

232
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,900
[thunder rumbling]

233
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,826
- [shrieking]
- [gasps, pants]

234
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:19,910
[Paris gasps]

235
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,456
- [grunts]
- [Paris] You heard it in your sleep.

236
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:27,918
Is that an owl?

237
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,923
Not an owl. That is a man.

238
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,845
We're in the Badlands, Baba.
Lawless land.

239
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,390
- And you are not well.
- [groans]

240
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,100
I'm fine.

241
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,603
Do the children know?

242
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,647
- There's no need for them to know.
- [scoffs]

243
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,775
They always know more than you think.

244
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,702
Did Haniwa speak to you?

245
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:03,662
Why?

246
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,624
She's holding something...

247
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,960
something that she cannot give voice to...

248
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,338
and it frightens her.

249
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,799
Well, she's mourning.

250
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,927
Ah, so is Kofun.

251
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:22,139
But he's not gripped by the same darkness.

252
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:28,562
They're different.
They need different things at this moment.

253
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,107
I would think you of all people
would understand what she needs.

254
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,400
What do you mean?

255
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,740
You remember when I first came to you?

256
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,994
The rage, and how destructive I was?

257
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:47,206
Because I was afraid.

258
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,251
Afraid to trust you...

259
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:55,214
afraid to believe that I actually escaped
and that it was true.

260
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,926
And do you remember
what you told me when I did?

261
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:03,681
I told you if you broke any more
of my things,

262
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,766
I would kill you in your sleep.

263
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,977
Yes. But after that...

264
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,230
do you remember what you did?

265
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:19,321
You sat and you stayed for as long as
it took me to be able to breathe again.

266
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:25,286
You stayed so that I would know
I was not alone.

267
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:30,124
Haniwa's lost.

268
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,878
She's facing an uncertain future...

269
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:38,424
a lost mother, and a new father.

270
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:43,888
But I will give her the space she needs.

271
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,099
And like you, I'll make sure
that she knows she's not alone.

272
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:52,563
[thunder rumbling]

273
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:56,275
[Paris humming]

274
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,156
[humming continues]

275
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,825
[bird cawing]

276
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:06,452
[Paris sniffs]

277
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,454
[gags]

278
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,331
- [Baba Voss coughs]
- [vomits, coughs]

279
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,124
- Paris, what is it?
- [Paris spits]

280
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,878
[groans]

281
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,964
Lavender no more. [sniffs]

282
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,092
I taste death.

283
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:24,637
[Paris gasps]

284
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,891
[Paris spits, gasps]

285
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,811
[Paris gags, mutters]

286
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,773
- [gags]
- [coughing]

287
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:40,152
It's days, it's maybe weeks.

288
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,739
It's human, isn't it?

289
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,373
[flies buzzing]

290
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,124
[Baba Voss] Oh...

291
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:57,545
[Baba Voss coughs]

292
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,838
[Baba Voss] Oh.

293
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:07,847
[flies buzzing]

294
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,850
[birds cawing]

295
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,569
[Kofun reading] "A new world lies beyond.

296
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:27,074
A new god resides within.

297
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,790
Enter, and be seen.

298
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,877
Enter, and be judged.

299
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,881
Enter, and find death.

300
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,801
Enter, and be seen."

301
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:49,013
Jerlamarel.

302
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,058
He's lost his fucking mind.

303
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,727
[Paris] Perhaps not.

304
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,980
Maybe... Maybe this is what happens

305
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,692
when your work is important
and you don't want visitors.

306
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:02,943
[Kofun] Paris, I don't know.

307
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:08,407
Oh, you must know now how dangerous
it is to be sighted in this world.

308
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,453
The lengths one must go to
to keep it at bay.

309
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,121
I agree with Paris.

310
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,253
We didn't come this far just to turn
around because of something like this.

311
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,132
I want both of you to know
what we set out to know.

312
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,885
I want to know
what we all sacrificed so much for.

313
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,973
I want to know
what I sacrificed my wife for.

314
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,976
I need to know it.

315
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,147
Come.

316
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,109
At least we know
we're going the right way.

317
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,949
[Paris] Kofun. [clicks tongue]

318
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:52,910
[Paris groans]

319
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,746
We forge ahead.

320
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,906
[wheel squeaking]

321
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,991
[banging]

322
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:46,046
<i>I saw four guards.</i>

323
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:50,259
One here, by the entrance.

324
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,219
Two more...

325
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,764
patrolling between
the rows of silk workers.

326
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,267
And another by the second window.

327
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,563
The workers are all stationary, then?
Only the guards are walking?

328
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:06,233
Yes. And they tap their staffs
to announce their presence.

329
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,944
What kind of shoes are the guards wearing?

330
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,157
What kind of shoes?
Are they leather? Are they wood?

331
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,117
Leather, I think.

332
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,329
And what about the queen?
Do you know where she is?

333
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:22,291
I don't know what the queen looks like.

334
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,420
There was a bloodied woman here,
in the back.

335
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,339
Bloodied? Is she alive?

336
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:29,423
I don't know.

337
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,969
So, you're certain?
Four guards and a space in between them?

338
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,304
That's what I saw.

339
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,306
That's what you saw.

340
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,475
As if vision absolves you
from being wrong.

341
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,560
You have enough men
to overwhelm them, don't you?

342
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:44,939
The moment they hear any of us,
the moment they sense us,

343
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,191
the moment an alarm is given,
this is over.

344
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,651
The only way to reach her alive

345
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,111
is for there to be no guards left
by the time they know we're here.

346
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,239
One man must do it, one at a time.

347
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,991
I'll do it. I can get them all.

348
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:59,370
I remember asking for your eyes, witch,
not your opinion.

349
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,373
The future of the kingdom is at stake.

350
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,875
I've relied upon you
as far as I'm willing.

351
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,461
Unless, Maghra, you trust him.

352
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,465
Forget I asked.

353
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,970
Marshal a vanguard. Signals, no words.

354
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,807
The next man to speak will be me,
when I'm ready to call you in.

355
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,058
If you give no signal?

356
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,810
Then I have failed, the queen is dead.

357
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:24,228
You should burn everything to the ground

358
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:27,231
and take the princess to Kanzua
and see her installed upon the throne.

359
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,108
I haven't consented to that.

360
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,610
If it comes down to that,
you won't have to.

361
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:33,529
Is it going to come down to that?

362
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,613
No.

363
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:40,828
[horse whinnies]

364
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,003
[tapping]

365
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:58,429
[tapping]

366
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:19,742
[bones snap]

367
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:21,785
[soft thud]

368
00:28:25,915 --> 00:28:30,002
[staff tapping]

369
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:34,006
- [woman grunts]
- Cutter! Cutter! Come over here!

370
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,090
Guards.

371
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,093
[guard]
There's an intruder! Someone's here!

372
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,179
[Cutter] Up, bitch.

373
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,515
- [Cutter screams]
- [Queen Kane grunts]

374
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:47,645
[grunts]

375
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,356
My knife. My knife.

376
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:51,607
- [Cora grunts]
- [Cutter shouts]

377
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,444
[groaning]

378
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:58,155
[choking]

379
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:03,661
You think I would tell her who I am
without having a plan? Huh?

380
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:06,914
- [blade slicing]
- [guard grunts]

381
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:20,386
[panting]

382
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,888
[Tamacti Jun] Majesty?

383
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:24,348
The queen is here.

384
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,353
Why doesn't she speak?

385
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,314
[gasps, sighs] I'm fucking tired.

386
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:37,278
It's all right. [pants] You're safe now.

387
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,365
[whimpers]

388
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,126
How did this happen?

389
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,170
How did they get you?

390
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,173
[Queen Kane] I had to leave.

391
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,802
Someone moved against you. Who was it?

392
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,805
So many.

393
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:11,145
You'll recover soon,
and we'll return to Kanzua.

394
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,149
But first, a healer's coming.

395
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:16,817
[snaps fingers]

396
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,695
[snaps fingers]

397
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:22,656
[footsteps approach]

398
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,206
She's here.

399
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,655
[breathes heavily]

400
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:06,075
- [gasps] Careful.
- Of course.

401
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,099
Have we met?

402
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,708
I'm sorry this happened to you.

403
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,506
You shouldn't leave, Maghra.

404
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:10,723
Not until you've heard the news.

405
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:16,020
What news, Your Majesty?

406
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,107
They all moved against me.

407
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,945
Claimed the gods were on their side.

408
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:30,242
And when they failed,
I was left with a choice:

409
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:34,872
to let this heresy stand...

410
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,667
or to answer with one of my own.

411
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:41,879
What does that mean?

412
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,298
You wish to return me to Kanzua?

413
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,718
There is no Kanzua.

414
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:55,351
For years, we held power based on
the whim of the machines beneath us.

415
00:32:56,352 --> 00:33:00,022
When they chose to work, we were adored.

416
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,442
When they didn't, we weren't.

417
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:10,115
I don't want to be queen
because the machines work.

418
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,038
I want to be queen because I am.

419
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,336
So now the story will be this:

420
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:28,968
The gods took the dam.

421
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,931
They destroyed it in a rage

422
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:38,227
and took with it the true heretics.

423
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:43,023
The weak, the selfish, the backward.

424
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:47,778
But they left me.

425
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:50,823
Only me.

426
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:57,079
You destroyed it.

427
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:05,004
Those soldiers out there...

428
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:12,887
For 20 years, they've done your bidding
on the promise that one day,

429
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,765
they will return to their homes,
their families.

430
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,603
Through countless battles...

431
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:25,149
and miseries and horrors,

432
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,652
that was what sustained them.

433
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,155
And you just took it all away.

434
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,575
I did what needed to be done.

435
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,536
I saved our dynasty.

436
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,790
You think I'm gonna go out there

437
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:47,671
and tell my men all their families
were killed to save your dynasty,

438
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:51,050
and they'll just go
wherever I tell them from there?

439
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:53,469
Your men?

440
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,055
My men.

441
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:07,274
And I think they will do as I tell them...

442
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,194
because I am their queen.

443
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:19,828
I think,
for the first time in a long time...

444
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,749
that's something we should reconsider.

445
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,314
Whoa, whoa.

446
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:48,399
What?

447
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:50,484
- Why are we stopping?
- [Baba Voss] Shh.

448
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:52,278
Something doesn't feel right.

449
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,156
- What's ahead?
- It's a mountain pass.

450
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,994
- Is there another way around?
- No, not that I can see.

451
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,204
Paris.

452
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:04,331
I sense conflicting things.

453
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,375
I dream danger.

454
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:09,336
But I'm not exactly sure
where the danger lies.

455
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,380
Maybe because there is none.

456
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,048
We'll find another way around.

457
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:14,633
We'll lose days.

458
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:17,052
- I said we find another way around.
- There is nothing here.

459
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:18,971
Kofun, tell him there's nothing here.

460
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,723
Dad, I don't see anything.

461
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,060
- [scoffs] I'll go.
- Hey.

462
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,606
Kofun, where is the God Flame in the sky?

463
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:30,149
It's already passed behind the mountain.

464
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:31,817
Why should the sun matter to you?

465
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:34,320
It doesn't. I'm just trying to figure out

466
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:37,323
how soon it will be dark
and you'll be completely useless.

467
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,449
Baba.

468
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:02,932
[Haniwa gasps]

469
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,532
Sound traps.

470
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:27,915
Point to them.

471
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:50,896
[distant clicking]

472
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,360
[bow creaking]

473
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:57,444
Yeah.

474
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,238
Go.

475
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:05,578
[archer grunts, screams]

476
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:06,996
[arrows thudding]

477
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,138
Don't move.

478
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,893
There's a bow and arrow. We need it.

479
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:36,734
What are you doing?

480
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:43,782
I can move in silence. You can't.

481
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,146
[arrow clatters]

482
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:57,690
[grunts]

483
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,026
- Haniwa, no!
- [archer leader] Cease fire!

484
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,237
[Bow Lion groans, pants]

485
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:06,031
[archer leader] You are Haniwa?

486
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:07,575
Yes.

487
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,787
[archer leader] And you who shouted...

488
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:14,582
what's your name?

489
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,084
Kofun.

490
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:19,044
Children of Jerlamarel,

491
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,423
just beyond these trees there is a bridge.

492
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:26,760
You may pass over that bridge
into the House of Enlightenment.

493
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:31,265
Is there a healer
in the House of Enlightenment?

494
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,017
[archer leader] You cannot pass.

495
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,227
You just told us we could cross.

496
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:39,273
Only the children of Jerlamarel may cross
into the House of Enlightenment.

497
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,610
There is only one rule, and that is it.

498
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:46,739
You tell Jerlamarel that we're here.
He'll understand.

499
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,242
Only Kofun and Haniwa may cross.

500
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:51,327
You listen to me...

501
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,703
- [arrows thud]
- Boy.

502
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:57,124
[archer leader]
There is only one rule, and that is it.

503
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:01,462
You can tell Jerlamarel why his son
and daughter came all this way

504
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:02,755
just to turn back!

505
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,340
We're not turning back.

506
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:07,509
What are you talking about?
We have to turn back.

507
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,095
- She needs a healer.
- No. She has Dad and Paris.

508
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,680
He can take her to another tribe.

509
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,224
What are you talking about?
We're not leaving her here, Haniwa.

510
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,100
[Haniwa] She doesn't need all of us.

511
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,519
- We stay together.
- Kofun.

512
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:17,686
- Enough.
- [Kofun] This is crazy.

513
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,771
Enough.

514
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,856
Listen to me. Listen to me.

515
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:25,027
Haniwa, Kofun,

516
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:29,698
we have traveled too far,
at too great a cost, to turn back now.

517
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,869
I have thought about this
for a long while now.

518
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:37,873
I never wanted to believe it,
but Paris is right.

519
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:44,255
Every child eventually comes to a bridge
that they must cross alone.

520
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,215
What are you talking about?

521
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:51,262
The day you were born, I stood on a wall
fighting to protect you,

522
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,347
and I have done it every day since.

523
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,101
That's what a father does
to protect his children.

524
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:02,565
But a father must also know
when it is time to let his children go

525
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,650
so that they might find their own path.

526
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,905
- That time is now.
- No, that's not true.

527
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:13,909
That's not true.
Haniwa, tell him it's not true.

528
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:15,452
It is true, Kofun.

529
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,914
You and I live
in a different world than him.

530
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:20,958
We always have.

531
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,628
We'll never really understand each other.

532
00:42:25,129 --> 00:42:26,881
He brought us here knowing that.

533
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,924
Why would you do that?

534
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,347
Because I'm your father.

535
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:36,765
[Haniwa] Oh, Papa.

536
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,893
My baby girl. [sniffles]

537
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,312
You are wrong.

538
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,149
We don't live in different worlds.

539
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,860
You and your brother

540
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:51,030
are the only world that I have lived in
since the day you were born.

541
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,910
My children, I'm as blind as anyone.

542
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,413
But I see you both.

543
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,708
I will never stop seeing you.

544
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:05,377
But I was right.

545
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:06,795
[sword taps]

546
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,673
This day had come,
and you must meet your father.

547
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:11,508
Dad, you're my father.

548
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,345
[Kofun sniffles]

549
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,309
I love you, boy.

550
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:21,810
[Kofun sniffles]

551
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:28,567
We'll see you again?

552
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:30,486
[chuckles]

553
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,822
Yes.

554
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,118
Bow Lion.

555
00:43:43,082 --> 00:43:45,709
This will be like a...
like a tickle for you.

556
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,461
- Aaah! [inhales sharply]
- Oh. [sniffs] Yes.

557
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,964
[Bow Lion exhales]

558
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:51,048
Good.

559
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:54,468
[Bow Lion inhales sharply, grunts]

560
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:56,303
[Baba Voss grunts]

561
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,560
[Baba Voss] Remember your mother always.

562
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,521
Protect each other at all costs.

563
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,776
- Dad.
- Kofun, no. Stop.

564
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,611
He'll be alone.

565
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:17,366
He will have Maghra with him always.

566
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:23,038
And now, he will have the two of you.

567
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,917
I will be with him.

568
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,047
Look to your sister.

569
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:34,633
She knows.

570
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,221
Now...

571
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:43,684
listen carefully, both of you.

572
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:48,647
The gift of sight can be blinding.

573
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:55,279
Jerlamarel... is your father,

574
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:58,032
and he is sighted.

575
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:02,703
But he is not a god, and neither are you.

576
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:07,041
If you are to build this world...

577
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:10,836
remember your mother.

578
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:16,091
And remember Baba Voss,
who taught you all things.

579
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:21,597
And you build this new world
for the sighted as well as the unsighted.

580
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:25,392
With no gods! Do you understand?

581
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,854
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

582
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:30,231
- Yes.
- Okay.

583
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:32,024
Oh, my babies.

584
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:33,651
[chuckles, sniffles]

585
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,655
[sighs] Read the books for me.
Read the books for me.

586
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:39,740
[Paris] Mmm.

587
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,620
[sighs] Young man.

588
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,247
- [Kofun] Oh.
- Mmm.

589
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,250
[exhales] My staff.

590
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:55,130
Okay, go. Go now.

591
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:59,552
Go now before it's too dark
for you to see. [chuckles]

592
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,561
[Haniwa]
I can't believe he really left us.

593
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,147
We're the ones who left.

594
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,317
[sniffles]

595
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:17,403
- [inhales]
- [Haniwa sniffles]

596
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:22,616
[Haniwa] Okay.

597
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:26,161
We're coming now, the two of us.

598
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,539
Haniwa and Kofun.

599
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,512
You and me together, little brother.

600
00:46:47,016 --> 00:46:48,976
Always, little sister.

601
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,021
Are you ready?

602
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:54,356
No.

603
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,983
Me neither. [chuckles]

604
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:02,198
Let's go.

605
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:17,963
You sent them alone.

606
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:23,010
Sometimes the best way
to protect your children

607
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,304
is to let them believe you've stopped.

608
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,390
Did Maghra tell you that?

609
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:31,101
Yes, she did.

610
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,648
The only home I have is those children.

611
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:38,526
I have nowhere else to be.

612
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:40,778
Do you?

613
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:44,907
So we stay close?

614
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:46,659
Oh, yes.

615
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,495
[Baba Voss] We stay close.

616
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:33,080
What now?

617
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:35,666
I don't know.

618
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:38,127
I can't see anything.

619
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,172
[switch clicks loudly]

620
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:45,843
[generator buzzing]
