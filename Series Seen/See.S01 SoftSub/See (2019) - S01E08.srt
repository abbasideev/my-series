[thunder rumbling]

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,405
Haniwa, Kofun, I'm very happy to see you.

21
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,865
Are you...

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,910
I'm Jerlamarel. Your father.

23
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,995
[gasps]

24
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,843
[murmurs]

25
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,517
When I heard the queen and her
Witchfinders found the Alkenny,

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,893
I feared the worst.

27
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,231
Let me look at you.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,067
[thunder rumbling]

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,361
Well, you must be exhausted
from your journey.

30
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,155
Come. I'll get you settled.

31
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,701
The House of Enlightenment.

32
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,788
[Kofun] I've never seen anything like it.

33
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,541
[Jerlamarel]
I found the building mostly intact.

34
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,503
It was once a prison,
so it was built to last.

35
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,173
Took me years of scavenging for parts
to build a generator,

36
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:58,345
but because of that we have electricity
for light, hot water, heat.

37
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,555
[animal bleating]

38
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,348
Everyone's so excited to meet you.

39
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,226
Everyone?

40
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,438
[birds screeching]

41
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,232
It's me.

42
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,742
Meet your brothers and sisters.

43
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,162
Haniwa, Kofun, you made it.

44
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,626
I am Oloman, your brother.

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,628
This is Sheva.

46
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,008
-That's Nonni, Sammy.
-Welcome.

47
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,634
This is Sheena.

48
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,345
Welcome.

49
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,015
Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,644
And these two little monsters over here
are Hayah and Hoveh.

51
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,983
Ah, you must be hungry.
Let's get some food.

52
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,036
For the food we eat
and the family we eat it with,

53
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,623
including our newest brother and sister,

54
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,958
we give thanks.

55
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,002
You may begin.

56
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,923
[slurping]

57
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,645
Mm.

58
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,107
[Jerlamarel]
Now you need to get some rest.

59
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,821
Haniwa, this is your room.

60
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,950
Kofun's will be right next door.

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,870
Here are your things.
This is your bed.

62
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,539
Oh.

63
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,921
This is a painting by Claude Monet.

64
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,343
Well, it's not an actual painting.
It's a reproduction.

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,847
It's beautiful, isn't it?

66
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,978
Yes, it is.

67
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,233
And I've saved the best for last.

68
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,613
These are your showers.

69
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,625
And this bottle here, your soap.

70
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,296
The water even gets heated.

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,049
Yes. We-- We read about it in the books.

72
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,052
I think you'll find this a bit more
satisfying than reading about it.

73
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,929
-Hmm.
-[shower turns off]

74
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,348
Come, Kofun. I'll show you your room.

75
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,025
They expect us to sleep in these things?

76
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,113
I guess so.

77
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,575
If we're all one big family,
why don't we sleep together?

78
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,203
I was thinking the same thing.

79
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,372
[chuckles]

80
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,585
Here. Get in.

81
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,935
So warm, without any fire.

82
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,862
I miss Dad.

83
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,952
I miss him too.

84
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,709
Do you think
we're ever gonna be with him again?

85
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,132
I don't know.

86
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,182
We just left him on his own...

87
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,144
after everything that happened with Mom.

88
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,942
I don't know why we came here.

89
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,587
-[horse whinnies]
-[chattering]

90
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,520
[chattering]

91
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,105
[wind whistling]

92
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,165
[groans]

93
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,173
No one talks to her.

94
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,427
No one comes near her.
Watch her like your life depends on it.

95
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,553
Does it?

96
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,263
Yes.

97
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,977
[dog barking]

98
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,208
[sighs]

99
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,169
You were right.

100
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,923
You warned me that sooner or later

101
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:36,970
I would regret supporting
your sister's continued reign.

102
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:48,565
But I doubt even you could have predicted
just how right you'd be.

103
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:01,954
Each one of these soldiers
lost a parent, child, a sibling, a spouse.

104
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:11,004
Every one of them could become the leader
of the mutiny against her... or us.

105
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,093
If they find out about what she's done...

106
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,096
I fear there'll be no stopping it.

107
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,222
If?

108
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,433
How can it be prevented?

109
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:30,816
The only people here who know the story
are you, me, your witch

110
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,527
and the queen's accomplice,
who is currently under guard.

111
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,487
And the queen herself.

112
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,033
Sooner or later, your men
are gonna want to hear from their queen.

113
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,829
And how do we prevent the story
from coming out then?

114
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,333
She cannot be allowed to emerge
from that building as queen again.

115
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,419
What exactly does that mean?

116
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,590
It means there are two outcomes
available to us.

117
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:58,552
Either she emerges having abdicated
the throne willingly,

118
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:03,432
blessed her sister as her successor
and agreed to be ruled by her...

119
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:08,187
or she does not emerge at all.

120
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,232
She will never give up the throne
no matter what you say to her.

121
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,403
Nothing I can say
would persuade her to do it.

122
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,115
So you will have to try.

123
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,955
You're with Princess Maghra, yes?

124
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,878
The Witchfinder trusts you to guard me.

125
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,341
I presume that means you're sworn
either to him or to her.

126
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,468
And I have to assume it's to her,

127
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,180
given the contempt
that he clearly holds for you.

128
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,932
You should be quiet now.

129
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:51,730
Just yesterday I was property
to the most brutal of men.

130
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,401
I acquiesced because it was better
than the alternative...

131
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,198
right up to the moment when it wasn't.

132
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,161
What is it exactly that you owe her?

133
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,206
Huh? Your loyalty perhaps.

134
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,124
But your obedience,

135
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,628
your future, your life?

136
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,548
How can that be?

137
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:25,347
The queen has made it clear what
I stand to gain if I solve this problem.

138
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,516
Let me make it clear to you

139
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,895
what you stand to gain
if you help me solve it.

140
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,442
It's good to be lieutenant to a princess,

141
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,782
but it's so much better
to be lieutenant to a queen.

142
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,748
[bells jingling]

143
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,119
What's this?

144
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,830
Read it.

145
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,259
There was a time, before all this,

146
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,013
where you could still be counted on
to see reason.

147
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,268
I remember that version of my sister.

148
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:58,899
And I'm here in the hopes
that she still exists within you.

149
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:04,238
And that she'll accept
the reality of her situation

150
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,449
and do the sensible thing.

151
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,453
[gasps]

152
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,623
"Abdicate the throne."

153
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,546
Affix your seal. Endorse it.

154
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,134
Read it to the men, today, right now.

155
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:34,393
And accept its result that you will live
under my rule as queen.

156
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,939
What a fantasy this must have been.

157
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:44,403
Walking in here, thinking I might
actually do this for you.

158
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,781
For me?

159
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,788
Do it. Don't do it.

160
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:59,626
I offer this to you out of mercy
and for the sake of our father's memory.

161
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,838
Whether you choose
to accept it or not is your choice.

162
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,514
But it isn't my choice, Maghra.

163
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,809
You know that.

164
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,941
It's just not something
that can be bargained away.

165
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,030
Negotiated under duress to save my life

166
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,033
or to impart
some longed-for meaning to yours.

167
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,746
Only the gods decide who's king or queen.

168
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,665
And when they do, Death must be a witness,

169
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,962
or there is no succession,
no majesty, no legitimacy.

170
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,257
Just a petty lie agreed upon
by petty people.

171
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,678
If you want my divinity...

172
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,933
one of you must have the courage
to pick up a knife and come take it.

173
00:16:56,016 --> 00:17:00,229
God's law, God's voice, God's words.

174
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,524
It's amazing how they all just align

175
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,236
with whatever it is
that you want at any given moment.

176
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,950
It is fitting then that you'll meet
your end in a place like this,

177
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,410
declaring God's will to be on your side

178
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,704
as misfortune strips you
of everything and anything

179
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,915
that you once laid claim to bit by bit.

180
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,877
The offer to abdicate stands.

181
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,008
Do it, don't do it.

182
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,594
It's entirely up to you.

183
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,903
[children shouting]

184
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,368
[children giggling]

185
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,005
Get any sleep?

186
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,174
Not really.

187
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,925
I can imagine.

188
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,136
You've left behind everything
you've ever known.

189
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,514
It's natural to feel a bit lost.

190
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,101
But I promise you, the opposite is true.

191
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,103
[children laughing]

192
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,646
You're with your family now.

193
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,650
Come on. I'll show you around.

194
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,320
This is where we study every day.

195
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,571
A pencil?

196
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,781
We all have so much to learn.

197
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,908
Right?

198
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,621
And here we are, the librarium.

199
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,123
[chuckles]

200
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,542
Took me almost ten years
to get all these books in here.

201
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,963
Science, mathematics, medicine,

202
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:56,136
history, geography, engineering,
literature.

203
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,933
Our ancestors were very meticulous
when it came to documenting

204
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,602
their knowledge and accomplishments
for posterity.

205
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,064
It's almost as if they knew
we would one day need them.

206
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:13,070
There is so much I'd like to share
with you, this blessing that we have.

207
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,244
This blessing can often feel
like a curse, can't it?

208
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,248
Because every day,
we see all the wasted potential

209
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,875
in this world and in ourselves.

210
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,377
And you feel alone.

211
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,671
Really?

212
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,507
Kofun, you know what I mean.

213
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:40,848
We've had to hide all of these things
that we can do from everyone.

214
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,724
Exactly.

215
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:47,354
I've spent most of my life traveling,
searching for others like me.

216
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,941
And I've crossed the Trivantes
all the way to the Western Badlands.

217
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,903
And west of the Payan
all the way to the Atlantic.

218
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,447
I have never found a sighted person.

219
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,991
You've seen the ocean?

220
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,118
I've swum in it.

221
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,704
So, why did you come back?

222
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,914
To build this place.

223
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,166
A citadel of knowledge

224
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:13,338
and a sanctuary where we could
safely gather and learn.

225
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:19,219
Educating ourselves and eventually others
of the sciences of our forefathers.

226
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,014
But you said you never found
another person with sight.

227
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,310
I didn't. So, I made you.

228
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,686
Are we all your children?

229
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,983
Yes. You, Kofun,

230
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,944
Oloman, Sheva.

231
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,488
Everyone except the two little ones.

232
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,157
They are Oloman's.

233
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,950
And their mothers?

234
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,162
They love their mothers dearly
as you love yours.

235
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,372
And there is always a place for her here.

236
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,749
Our mother is dead.

237
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,502
-What?
-She was killed by the Witchfinders.

238
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,836
Oh.

239
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,381
I am very sorry to hear that.

240
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,259
I was quite fond of her.

241
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,595
Can't have been that fond of her.
You left her alone.

242
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,472
-Kofun.
-Pregnant with your children.

243
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,225
You left us alone our entire lives.

244
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,520
Did you not want to know us?

245
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,105
Who we were, what we were like?

246
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,192
You have every right to be upset.

247
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,820
You know, I would be lying
if I said I didn't regret

248
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,948
the way I handled some of these matters.

249
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,408
I was young. Often unwise.

250
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,203
Being chosen doesn't make me perfect.

251
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,539
No, far from it.

252
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:33,210
But I was chosen, Kofun.
You must see that.

253
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,547
A sighted baby born to blind parents.

254
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,092
I was born to be a bridge
between this dark world

255
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,802
and a better one to come.

256
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:46,265
We've been given a divine mission.
And we will be remembered.

257
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:50,435
Our names will be spoken
for the rest of human history.

258
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,903
Come on. I'll show you the generator.

259
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,532
[Kofun sighs]

260
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,783
What are you doing?

261
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,578
He doesn't even care that Mom is dead.

262
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,496
Of course he cared.

263
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,541
He was clearly upset about it,
but she wasn't his wife.

264
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,543
No, she was just there
to carry his babies.

265
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,505
To carry us, Kofun.
I don't think you're being very fair.

266
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:23,051
What, so he believed that we were chosen
to bring light into the world?

267
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,178
Chosen.

268
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:25,971
Born.

269
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:31,894
Call it what you like. All I know is that
we've lived our lives in fear until now.

270
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,730
Hunted by people
who should really be afraid of us.

271
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,233
Wait, you want to be feared?

272
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:42,279
I'd rather be feared
than burned as a witch.

273
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,323
[Jerlamarel] Ready?

274
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,289
[fire roaring]

275
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,334
Is that all coal?

276
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:59,087
Yes, we have our own mine
just beyond the fence line.

277
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,507
-[Oloman coughing]
-The Payan lands are rich in coal.

278
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,800
That's how you power the lights?

279
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,761
Yeah. I'll show you.

280
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:07,763
Oloman.

281
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:09,806
Morning.

282
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,228
The burning of the coal in the boiler
creates steam under pressure.

283
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:18,690
Blows into the turbines which spins
the generator to create electricity.

284
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,610
You built this alone?

285
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,530
Yes. I rebuilt it.

286
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,491
But Oloman, he's the one that learned
how to really make it sing.

287
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,575
[Oloman] Ah.

288
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,328
I just added this.
Pressure release valve.

289
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,539
See, you've got to control the pressure,

290
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,958
or you either end up with none
or way too much.

291
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,210
Either way, no power.

292
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,840
Imagine what we can accomplish together
once we grow in numbers.

293
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,384
We'll be able to light entire cities.

294
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,554
What are cities for the blind people
gonna do with all that light?

295
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,389
These cities will be for the sighted.

296
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,392
There's about ten of us.
What about everyone else?

297
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,227
Is your plan just to leave them behind?

298
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,563
No. No, of course not, Kofun.

299
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,066
But make no mistake,
in the natural order of things,

300
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,402
the blind are the aberration, not us.

301
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,946
And soon enough, they will come to us,

302
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,532
asking us to father sighted children.

303
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,535
Children that will need
to be educated in a place like this.

304
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,996
And in the future, other places like this.

305
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:18,584
God, nature, whatever you wish to call it,

306
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,253
has elected to restore vision to humanity.

307
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,631
And that responsibility
has been given to us.

308
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,552
-Thank you, Oloman.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:33,849
Kofun.

310
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:42,858
I know Jerlamarel
can take some getting used to.

311
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,572
Does he think he's some kind of god?
That we're all gods?

312
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:53,452
No, not gods,
but the first of a new breed.

313
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,581
A returning race of humans
that can help realize our true potential

314
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,168
after living like frightened animals
in the darkness for 500 years.

315
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,129
Frightened animals?

316
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,759
I hope that you meet
my real father one day.

317
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,679
Look, I get it, Kofun.

318
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,182
It wasn't any easier for me
when I first got here.

319
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,685
But what you don't realize is that
even though you can see,

320
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:21,146
you've been living out there
in the darkness your whole life.

321
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,399
Just give it some time.

322
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,903
Jerlamarel may not have raised us,
but he made us with purpose.

323
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,697
-To bring light back into the world.
-That's right.

324
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,118
You can start by taking this shovel.

325
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,968
[woman]
The Witchfinders murdered your people.

326
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,220
We grieve for them.

327
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:57,015
Here, too, the Valeyas have known
the pain of their souls.

328
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,186
But my people worry that you
may lead Tamacti Jun back to us.

329
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:07,484
Our child is badly hurt
and in need of healers.

330
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,238
She won't last a day in the wild.

331
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,533
Would you turn her away?

332
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,413
You may leave the girl.

333
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,164
[grunts]

334
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,334
But you two must agree to make tracks
leading away from here.

335
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,378
You have my word.

336
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,549
Brave, Bow Lion. [sniffles]

337
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,093
Where will you go?

338
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:34,928
God Flame knows.

339
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:40,184
But the Valeya will be good to you.

340
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,898
You must make a life for yourself here.

341
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:51,486
There's nothing for you out there,
Bow Lion.

342
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,745
Your mother is in your spirit.

343
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:00,954
[sobs]

344
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,461
I dream a long life for you, dear girl.

345
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,464
With many journeys yet to come.

346
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,676
-Chet-chet.
-Chet-chet-chet.

347
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,653
My brave lion.

348
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,409
I stand with Baba.

349
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,551
[Baba Voss] We'll never forget you, Bow.

350
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,766
[Paris]
It's just you and me now, you big lump.

351
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,187
What gods did you anger to deserve this?

352
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:16,738
My mother taught me very sad days
last no longer than very happy days.

353
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,241
She a presage too?

354
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,871
-No. She liked to get drunk.
-Oh.

355
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:26,957
Which makes the lesson
no less valuable on that account.

356
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,835
It's starting to get cold.

357
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:34,047
We should start a fire.
I'll find something to kill.

358
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,488
[gate door closes]

359
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:14,755
Colonel. This is a surprise.

360
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:16,757
Is it?

361
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,134
I would think
you would've been expecting me

362
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:21,220
with the arrival of Baba Voss' children.

363
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,722
In fact, I was a little concerned
you didn't contact me

364
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,724
as you promised the general.

365
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,685
Did you think my archers
wouldn't send word?

366
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,772
[Jerlamarel] I was getting around to it.
It's been a little hectic around here.

367
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,358
[colonel] Well, we're here now.
Where are my prisoners?

368
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:40,906
[Jerlamarel] Tell me, why is the general
so fixated on these children specifically?

369
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,200
[colonel] It's my job
to follow the general's orders,

370
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,661
not to question them,
not to understand them.

371
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,455
You might wanna consider that.

372
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,710
Well, unlike you, I do not work
for the general. We're partners.

373
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:54,795
[scoffs]

374
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,922
Tell yourself that if it helps.

375
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:05,889
Are you absolutely certain these are
Baba Voss' children we're getting?

376
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:10,310
It's a long way to Trivantes
and we wouldn't want any mistakes.

377
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,067
You are getting his daughter, Haniwa.

378
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,319
-[colonel] And the son?
-No.

379
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:22,781
[staff clinking]

380
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,534
[colonel]
Are we going to have a problem here?

381
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:31,331
No problem at all.
As long as the boy stays here.

382
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:38,255
Might I remind you, my family and I
are armed and you are outnumbered.

383
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,631
[chuckles]

384
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,760
Well, then,
I guess the girl will have to do.

385
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,139
Kofun?

386
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:49,933
You don't have to sneak around.

387
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,811
They're talking about us.
Why are they talking about us?

388
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:53,937
What?

389
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,012
[gasps]

390
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,263
Haniwa!

391
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,515
[whimpers]

392
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,641
Kofun!

393
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:31,892
Baba!

394
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,894
[gasping]

395
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,236
[coughs]

396
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:52,621
[coughing]

397
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,148
Open the door!

398
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,192
Help!

399
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,571
Open the door!

400
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,698
Let me out!

401
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,161
Let me out!

402
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:41,295
Haniwa! Haniwa, Haniwa! No!

403
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,339
Open the door! Open the door!

404
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,179
Go.

405
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,097
Giddyap.

406
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,058
Giddyap.

407
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,646
You all right?

408
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,901
She was my daughter. Your sister.

409
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,905
I just-- I didn't see another way.

410
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:11,158
It's a shame.
She had such great potential.

411
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:14,912
What about Kofun?

412
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,497
What did he see?

413
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,499
Enough.

414
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,882
I waited so long for these two.

415
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,384
It's very upsetting.

416
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,312
[Tamacti Jun] You did what you could.

417
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,440
Not enough.

418
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:48,904
More than she would've done for you
if the roles were reversed.

419
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,491
Are you certain about that?

420
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,618
Yes. Very.

421
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:58,997
And, though maybe not at this moment,

422
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,042
on some level, so are you.

423
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,673
You are not to blame.

424
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,052
And if your father was here, he'd agree.

425
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,183
I'll make sure to be quick.

426
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,275
[staff tapping]

427
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,706
Witchfinder?

428
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:49,089
You have been a fixture in my life
for as long as I can remember.

429
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,552
It'll be nearly unthinkable
not having your counsel

430
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,096
in whatever future life
I'm about to step into.

431
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,604
I've made some additional remarks.

432
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,982
Assuming they have my sister's blessing,

433
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,651
I'll read them to the troops
to begin the transition.

434
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,076
My abdication.

435
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,123
-[footsteps]
-[gasps]

436
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,208
[grunts]

437
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,460
[Maghra] Stop! Stop! What are you doing?

438
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,463
Get away from him!

439
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,220
Tamacti Jun.

440
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,930
[Queen Kane whimpering]

441
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,098
[Maghra] What did you do?

442
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:42,851
What did you do?

443
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,939
[groaning]

444
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,983
[groaning]

445
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,909
Thank you for your service.

446
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,584
[Maghra] Sibeth, no.

447
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:09,628
What have you done?

448
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,505
Maghra, once a dog bites,

449
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,799
no matter how loyal
you remember him once being,

450
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,552
no matter your fondness for him,
he must be put down.

451
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,512
-You've killed us both.
-[scoffs] Hardly.

452
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,764
His army waits outside,
and when they find out--

453
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,933
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not his.

454
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,601
He just borrowed it.

455
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,687
And they will hear the truth,

456
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:31,733
that his guilt over the injuries
I sustained was simply too great to go on.

457
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,946
He took his own life
according to the Old Way.

458
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,241
A loyal servant to the end.

459
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:43,787
Obviously, if you and I
were to tell conflicting stories,

460
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,330
it would only cloud that truth.

461
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:48,500
Confusion would set in, chaos, and then,
yes, we probably both lose our heads.

462
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,754
Or we walk out of here together

463
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,257
and deliver the message,
in which I'll explain

464
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,803
that in this time of crisis, I will lead
my soldiers with my sister at my side.

465
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,515
The first time in my reign
that I'll rule with her counsel.

466
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:09,938
Don't be frightened.

467
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:12,399
I'm here.

468
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:14,902
I am right here.

469
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,697
[breathes shakily]

470
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,616
So much is about to change.

471
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:35,088
[lock rattling]

472
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,591
[yells]

473
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,261
Get off! Let go! Go!

474
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,347
Calm down, Kofun.

475
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,390
What did you do with my sister?

476
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:46,642
Your sister is fine.

477
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,435
You gave her to the Trivantians.

478
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,271
The Trivantians are not the monsters
you were raised to fear.

479
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,273
If it was not for my partnership
with them,

480
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:57,277
this place, my family, would all have
been killed long ago by the queen.

481
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:01,281
With our vision and the Trivantian army,

482
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:04,535
we can conquer the queen once and for all.

483
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,411
That will take years,

484
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:10,749
but soon we will control the most
powerful military on the continent.

485
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,003
We will no longer be hunted like dogs,
but seen as gods.

486
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,840
But it will take a sacrifice.

487
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,758
Huh?

488
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,014
Kofun, my son. I--

489
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,726
I'm not your son, you crazy fuck!

490
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,145
Shut your mouth.

491
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,024
You do not deserve the blessings
you've been given.

492
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:57,212
Take him out the back way.
I do not want the children to see him.

493
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,761
I'm very sorry.

494
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,015
You'll be taken to the outskirts
of the facility, then you're free to go.

495
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,977
What about my sister?

496
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,522
What about my sister?

497
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:19,318
What about my sister?
What about my sister?

498
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,444
[door slams]

499
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,946
Take everyone downstairs
and organize the larder.

500
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,907
Await my call.

501
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,284
I do not want the children to hear him.

502
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,020
[inhales deeply]

503
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,397
[muffled thud]

504
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,628
-Hey!
-Hey! Hey!

505
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,964
Dad. On your right.
On your right. On your right.

506
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,132
On your left!

507
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:25,843
Wall! Wall!

508
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,766
-We here?
-Yeah, we're here.

509
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,621
Ah.

510
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,168
[blade scrapes]

511
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,841
Jerlamarel!

512
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,014
Jerlamarel!

513
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,391
Where are you?

514
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,853
[door creaks, closes]

515
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,982
You're not hiding from me, are you?

516
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,571
Do you see me?

517
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,534
'Cause I smell you.

518
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:38,123
Hiding in your filth like a fucking rat.

519
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,172
Is this your House of Enlightenment?

520
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:48,550
There's no trees.

521
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,054
No air.

522
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:58,018
Just the putrid stench of things rotting.

523
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:06,860
Your vision and all your knowledge
is a disease that wiped out your kind.

524
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:08,779
But you feel nothing.

525
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:11,156
You fools know nothing.

526
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:19,206
Come on out and fight me
like a fucking man, you coward.

527
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,418
[Jerlamarel]
Baba Voss. It doesn't need to be this way.

528
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:33,220
You gave my baby girl to the Trivantians.

529
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,514
It's not my fault. It's yours.

530
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,851
The general only wanted her
because he thinks she's your daughter.

531
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,811
[books clatter]

532
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,188
What general?

533
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,649
[books clatter]

534
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,111
Edo Voss.

535
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,116
Edo.

536
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:55,659
Your brother.

537
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,329
And you just gave her to him?

538
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,081
I had no choice.

539
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:06,003
What kind of man waits 17 years
to meet his children only to betray them?

540
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:10,591
I am fighting for the entire human race!
Sacrifices must be made!

541
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,969
They're my children. You hurt them!

542
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,888
They are not your children.

543
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:20,642
They were made to fulfill a destiny
you couldn't possibly understand.

544
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:21,935
Is that right?

545
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,026
Oh!

546
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,084
I'm gonna tear your fucking head off!

547
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:48,712
No, you won't.

548
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,005
Ow!

549
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,425
[groaning]

550
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,637
You fuck. You fuck.

551
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,222
[yells]

552
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,724
Ow! [yells]

553
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:03,435
You can't possibly think
you can defeat me.

554
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,396
Oh. I'm stupid like that.

555
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,788
[clattering]

556
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,835
Where are you? Fucking coward.

557
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,469
[gunshot]

558
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,656
It's a weapon of the ancients.

559
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:01,702
Much more efficient
than your arrows and swords.

560
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,331
I know what a gun is.

561
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,835
It's a weapon of choice
for men with no balls.

562
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:30,856
[steam hissing]

563
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,115
You can't win, Baba Voss.

564
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,826
You live in a world of perpetual darkness.

565
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:48,624
I belong to a future where you and
your kind must be left behind forever.

566
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,626
[rattling]

567
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,754
[rattling stops]

568
00:45:57,132 --> 00:46:00,552
[Baba Voss]
Oh, no. Now, you're in my world.

569
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,222
[Baba Voss laughing]

570
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:05,557
[footsteps running]

571
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,560
Where are you?

572
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,063
[flesh squishes]

573
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,357
[Baba Voss] Everywhere.

574
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:15,776
[clinking]

575
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,530
[gunshot]

576
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:23,200
[gunshots]

577
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:25,035
No one leaves until I get back.

578
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,871
I smell your blood, Jerlamarel.

579
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,123
Yeah?

580
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,125
And your fear.

581
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,293
-[flesh squishes]
-[yelps]

582
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,628
[gunshot]

583
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,839
[Jerlamarel] Do you smell yours?

584
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:40,259
[Baba Voss] I'm going to bleed you out,
little by little.

585
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:47,057
So you can feel the life
draining from you.

586
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:54,064
A coward's death.

587
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:56,942
Slow and wet.

588
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,466
[yells, groans]

589
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,556
[bone cracks]

590
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,807
[Baba Voss laughs]

591
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,767
[yells, groans]

592
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:44,698
Chet-chet.

593
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:49,745
Look at me. Look at me.

594
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,164
You did this.

595
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,041
Wait, wait, wait.

596
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,751
Please, please! Please don't!

597
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:58,629
[Jerlamarel cries]

598
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,923
[screams]

599
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,801
[groaning]

600
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,678
[Jerlamarel gasping]

601
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:16,438
Kofun?

602
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,691
Yes.

603
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,319
[gasping continues]

604
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:23,403
Are you okay?

605
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:25,697
No, I'm not.

606
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,131
The Witchfinder is dead!

607
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,051
He was the last of his kind.

608
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,474
A soldier with the honor to recognize...

609
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:57,521
that having failed his queen, his kingdom,

610
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:01,066
his gods, and himself...

611
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:08,240
he had no choice
but to take a soldier's death,

612
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:12,828
which demands a release
in the traditional manner.

613
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,959
A hero to the end.

614
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:28,260
Who leaves us with the responsibility

615
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,388
to live up to his noble sacrifice.

616
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,393
So we forge ahead.

617
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:41,106
We will build a new world for ourselves.

618
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,569
A world without hardship.

619
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:49,823
A world without want.

620
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,452
-A world without--
-A world without fear.

621
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,246
A world without hate.

622
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:59,416
A world without superstition.

623
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:04,838
A new path unlike any we've
ever traveled before.

624
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:12,346
And in this new world that
Tamacti Jun's sacrifice made possible...

625
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:20,229
there may be no need
for Witchfinders at all.

626
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:31,406
Sergeant, we go to the Lavender Road.

627
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,285
[shouts in foreign language]

628
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,954
[shouting in foreign language]

629
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,466
That was interesting.

630
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:56,390
A world with no Witchfinders
would mean a world with no witches.

631
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,225
We're gonna find my family.

632
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,644
That's not up for discussion.

633
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:06,650
And when we do, I will not have them
labeled as fugitives by our army.

634
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:09,570
"Our" army?

635
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:11,655
Isn't it?

636
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,411
So, the road ahead
leads to a sighted kingdom.

637
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:21,373
I suppose I shall need a sighted king

638
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:24,543
in such a world
to give me sighted children.

639
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:29,464
Having been rejected by Jerlamarel once,

640
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:32,092
you can understand
why I'd not make the overture again.

641
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:39,683
What are you suggesting?

642
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,228
Tell me more about your son.

643
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,331
Chet-chet.

644
00:53:56,737 --> 00:53:57,988
What do you see, my boy?

645
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:01,783
Towers of God bone.

646
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,870
More than I've ever seen in my life.

647
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:07,456
There's smoke.

648
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,127
Paris.

649
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:14,338
She's here.

650
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,349
[Baba Voss] Let's go get your sister.
