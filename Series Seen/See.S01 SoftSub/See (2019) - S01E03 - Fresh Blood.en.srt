00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:37,179
A bad man...

543
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,103
but still, he's... he's dead.

544
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:43,978
I killed him

545
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:49,179
because I knew I had the power
to kill him and not be caught.

546
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,446
All that I've learned...

547
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,949
all that I've read...

548
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,452
all of it...

549
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:02,792
all of it makes me want to leave here.

550
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,739
But, Mama...

551
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:13,382
I'm scared of...

552
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:17,553
what I am and what I can do.

553
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:22,371
And I just want you to
know that I love you, Mama.

554
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:26,770
And I love you, Papa.

555
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,983
And one day, my big
mouth might get me burned.

556
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:32,531
No.

557
00:48:34,905 --> 00:48:36,597
I already know.

558
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:42,512
I know.

559
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,850
I know you.

560
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:49,942
My babies...

561
00:48:53,256 --> 00:48:56,069
Because I knew him.

562
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:01,074
And it's time I told you about him.

563
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:04,187
Jerlamarel.

564
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,939
It's time for the truth...

565
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,787
for all of us.

566
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:18,614
He was a good man.

567
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:22,288
But sometimes power
can consume goodness.

568
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:28,582
I'll tell you about him.

569
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:32,670
Baba, go and get Paris.

570
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,671
She should hear this too.
