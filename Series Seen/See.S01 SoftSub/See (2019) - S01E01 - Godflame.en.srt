This day...

542
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:54,285
we have crossed into a new world.

543
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,122
The man who built the bridge
to deliver us into it

544
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:01,501
will show us the way forward.

545
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:05,088
Paris, who is this man?

546
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:13,179
His name is Jerlamarel.

547
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:19,727
I knew him well, once.

548
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,147
He's a heretic.

549
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:29,237
The Witchfinders came in search of him
because he preaches a particular heresy.

550
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:35,827
He told me he has a power
that we would call magical or evil...

551
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:41,374
but which he says almost every human being
on earth once had.

552
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:45,003
He preaches that the God bone
we use for weapons and tools

553
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:49,507
was not made by the gods,
as we've been told.

554
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:53,928
Nor the eternal smooth that never rots.

555
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:56,931
Or the flat, straight mountains of Payan.

556
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,684
They were all made by humans.

557
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:06,483
Human beings like us, who all had
the same lost ability as he has.

558
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:10,570
Jerlamarel said
he could not explain it to me.

559
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:14,824
He only said he has the power to see.

560
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:29,144
And if we follow his instruction,
we will find sanctuary.

561

There is nothing behind us.

If any object,
argue now for a better way forward.

563
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:52,070
Then it is settled.

564
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:57,158
[PARIS] There is a river beyond.

565
00:50:57,182 --> 00:51:00,286
Our Scentiers will dream its willows.

566
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:08,962
And for 30 days and 30 nights,
we will follow its path.

567
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:12,632
When the path beside the river disappears,

568
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:18,346
we will walk in the water,
so no dogs can follow.

And through that waterfall, a sanctuary.

A place no one would dare wander.

575
