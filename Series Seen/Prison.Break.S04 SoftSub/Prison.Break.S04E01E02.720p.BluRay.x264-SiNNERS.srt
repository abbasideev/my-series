MICHAEL:
My name is Michael Scofield...

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,925
...and I'm a fugitive.

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,431
Three weeks ago,
I was in a Panamanian prison.

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,269
While I was there,
I was approached by the Company.

5
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,107
The Company is a corrupt organization...

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,984
...involved in all levels of industry
and government.

7
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,488
They gave me two options:

8
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:34,158
Break one of their men, James Whistler,
out of that prison...

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,038
...or else they would kill
the only woman I ever loved...

10
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,665
...Dr. Sara Tancredi.

11
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,671
I held up my end of the deal,
and I broke Whistler out.

12
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,923
But the Company...

13
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,343
...they killed Sara anyway.

I don't know why the Company
wanted James Whistler out of prison...

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,854
...but I've tracked him here
to Los Angeles.

16
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,941
He's with another Company agent
I know only as Gretchen.

17
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,654

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,041
He was assigned to retrieve Scylla

-It's the Company's little black book.
