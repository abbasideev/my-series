how that happened?

172
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,739
I caught an elbow
playing basketball.

173
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,285
We should discuss
your situation.

174
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,370
As I'm sure
you've ascertained

175
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,998
this isn't going to be
a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

176
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,833
Do I deliver in here?
No.

177
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:58,045
The day we induce,
we'll secure you
in an ambulance,

178
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,340
take you to Saint Lucia
down the road,
we'll cordon off a room.

179
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,301
There'll be three armed guards
in there with me
when you give birth.

180
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,094
Do I get to see my baby?

181
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,973
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

182
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,354
I've seen this process
a dozen times.

183
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,398
After the mothers come back
here, the depression
is almost unbearable.

184
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:23,904
My advice, it's a lot less
messy if you just think
of yourself as a surrogate.

185
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,539
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

186
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,251
Yeah.

187
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,628
Michael, it's Blue Phillips.

188
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,130
Listen, your wife
had an incident
earlier today.

189
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
Someone tried to
poison her.

190
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,718
What are you talking about?

191
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,303
Michael, I need
you to focus.

192
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,138
Do you have any idea
who might've done this?

193
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,141
Michael? Michael.

194
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,645
All right. Let him in.

195
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,618
If I had a list of
all the people
who might come to visit me,

196
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,788
your name would be
at the bottom,
somewhere below

197
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,748
Jesus Christ
and Scooby Doo.

198
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,917
Someone tried to
poison Sara today.

199
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,711
Mercy!

200
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,589
Only you would be
depraved enough

201
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,466
to think that
killing an innocent woman
and her unborn child

202
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,636
would bring you
some kind of peace
before your execution.

203
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,264
Sara is with child?

204
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,100
Congratulations.

205
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,270
This is like the 4th of July
and Christmas day
rolled into one.

206
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,691
I'm asking you,
father to father,
to leave her alone.

207
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,779
You can kill me
if you want to kill me.
I'll trade my life for hers.

208
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,198
But leave Sara alone.

209
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:56,663
Michael, if you were killed,
your pain would last a moment.

210
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,002
If Sara were killed,
your pain would last
the rest of your life.

211
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,839
Now, that's got to be
appealing to whoever
put out this hit.

212
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,842
But don't worry, Michael,

213
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,220
if I find out anything
I'll be sure
to let you know.

214
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,391
WARDEN: Prison life
can be tough.

215
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,476
If I remember correctly

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,770
you have two missing toes
that can
attest to that fact.

217
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,065
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

218
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,654
Please. Please just
approve the transfer
to another facility.

219
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,906
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody is gonna want one.

220
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,699
What about
segregated housing?

221
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,411
Is there something that
I should know about the
structural integrity of SHU?

222
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,830
Great. I can see
where this is going.

223
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,332
I know who you are

224
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,335
and I'm not gonna let you
turn my prison
into the next Fox River.

225
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,630
All I'm trying to do
is keep my wife alive.

226
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,799
You do know
she's pregnant.

227
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,759
I don't care.

228
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,359
Here.

229
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,485
Thanks.

230
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,195
In case I haven't
made myself clear,

231
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,573
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

232
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,453
Well, you've made yourself
perfectly clear.
Thank you for your time.

233
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,626
LINCOLN: What happened?

234
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,044
The General
wants Sara dead

235
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,671
and the warden's
just gonna let it happen.

236
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,298
Look, we got a lawyer
on the case, and he's gonna
get her out, all right?

237
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,550
There's not enough time.

238
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,761
If she stays in that prison,
someone's gonna kill her.

239
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,180
I guess we don't
have a choice.

240
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,977
We're breaking her out.

241
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,487
LANG: In my 16 years
in the Bureau,

242
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,365
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

243
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:02,289
Alexander Mahone is
the smartest, bravest,

244
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,293
most honorable man
I've ever had the pleasure
of serving with.

245
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,588
SULLINS: Well, as one of
those 43 agents,

246
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,174
I can't help
but feel a bit offended,

247
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,219
because, obviously,
I'm not as honored as this
drug-addicted murderer.

248
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,515
Alex has been clean
and sober for four months.

249
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,392
And he's been
completely exonerated

250
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,103
of all crimes associated
with his involvement
with the Company.

251
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,523
That doesn't include
the shooting and murder
of one Oscar Shales

252
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,984
and burying his body
under the birdbath.

253
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,569
That is just an allegation.

254
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,321
Let's move on, shall we?

255
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,157
All those in favor
of reinstating
Alexander Mahone

256
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,410
as Special Agent
in the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

257
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,370
Aye.

258
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,416
All those opposed.

259
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,168
All right. All right.

260
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,713
(EXHALES)

261
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,926
Thank you
for the invite, Richard.

262
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,722
It's always a pleasure.

263
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,977
You know, Alex,
this ruling can be revisited

264
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,021
if you are able to
sufficiently demonstrate

265
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,566
just how committed you are
to a life of service.

266
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,320
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi
was arrested recently

267
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,949
and is currently being housed
at the Miami-Dade
State Penitentiary.

268
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,410
We have concerns
that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

269
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,162
(LAUGHS)

270
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,457
So this... This is why
you invite me in here?

271
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,168
SULLINS:
Well, obviously,
if Scofield

272
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,839
were to be able to
pull off this plot
of another breakout,

273
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,259
the public embarrassment
would be immense
to the Bureau.

274
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,595
So, having someone to get us
credible information,

275
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,681
that would be worth
something to us.

276
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,976
Agent Wheatley
is set up in Miami.
He would be your contact.

277
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,936
You're something else.

278
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:01,992
Now, we both know
how badly you want
that badge back.

279
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,537
Give me a reason
to give it to you.

280
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,083
What's your plan
after we break her out?
We on the run again?

281
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,085
First things first.
Let's get her out of there.

282
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,339
Hey, papi, the Fed
that arrested Sara,
he's outside, staking us out.

283
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,177
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

284
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,973
go back to Chicago,
go back to your family.
I'll understand.

285
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,182
Are you kidding me?

286
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,309
After all the crap
we've been through,

287
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,477
I'm just gonna
leave you here
and Sara in there?

288
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,813
You shut up and
don't bring it up again.

289
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,023
What's all that?

290
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:37,402
Newspaper clippings
covering seven different
escape attempts

291
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,863
from Miami-Dade State Pen
over the last 60 years.

292
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,449
None of them...
None of them successful.

293
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,077
So, we read them all
and we learn
what not to do.

294
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,454
Well, the prison officials
learned a lot.

295
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,789
They reevaluated,
they retrofitted.

296
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,833
Prison's practically
escape-proof.

297
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,127
You all right?
I'm fine.

298
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,548
Okay, so if we can't
go through,
what if we go down?

299
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,009
Like down into the prison,
like we parachute in.

300
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,886
Yeah.

301
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,012
Yeah, you parachute in,
you find her,

302
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,096
and we get her out.
Are you kidding?

303
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,431
I'm serious.
That's suicide.

304
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,602
Hey! Hey, hey.
Newspaper clippings are
only gonna get us so far.

305
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,437
We need some more information
about the prison.

306
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,689
So let's do
some recon work.

307
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,443
"Camera,
electronic tape measure,
dry ice." What's this?

308
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,362
It's a shopping list.

309
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,035
You need to
come with me, doll.

310
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,496
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy
in 15 minutes.

311
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,789
It'll wait.

312
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,708
In here.

313
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,711
Hold it.

314
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,642
I don't know what you want,
but I promise you,
I will go down fighting.

315
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,269
Damn, baby,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

316
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,815
Hell, I ain't even
gonna touch you.

317
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,072
See, I run the motor pool
detail in here,

318
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,117
and I was thinking,
if you want to get yourself
a little fresh air

319
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,995
and not have to worry about
getting stuck in the back,

320
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,664
then you could come
and work with me.

321
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,430
You're the Fed
from my wedding.

322
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,057
Yeah, you can call me
Agent Wheatley.

323
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,600
I could call you
a lot of things.

324
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,976
Where you headed?
SeaWorld.

325
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,644
SeaWorld?
There isn't one in Miami.

326
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,729
My loss.

327
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,481
No, what'd really
be your loss

328
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,067
is getting your wife killed
by doing something stupid.

329
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,568
Are you
threatening Sara?

330
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,736
No, no, no.
Not at all.

331
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,781
I'm just saying,
if you were gonna try
and revoke her sentence,

332
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,115
bullets fly, Michael.

333
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,409
And if she were
to get hurt,
that'd be on you.

334
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,287
Funny, hearing that
from the guy who put her
in prison in the first place.

335
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,415
No, I didn't
put her in prison.
The State of Florida did.

336
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,502
It's just my job
to make sure
that she stays there.

337
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,838
So, where's all
your little buddies?

338
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,680
All right. Drop in
some more dry ice.

341
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:12,033
Fence line is four feet
from the road.

342
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:22,210
And 32 feet from
the east camera.

343
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,003
Hurry up.
They're gonna see the laser.

344
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,839
I'm going
as fast as I can.

00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,803
He follow you?

347
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,513
Yeah, but he's gone now.

348
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,014
You guys almost done?

349
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,892
Almost.
Great.

350
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,354
I'll meet you back
at the loft.

351
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,750
Why, you just a natural.

352
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,963
I bet you was
a hell of a surgeon.

353
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,676
Handing out condoms
to cons don't make you
no damn surgeon.

354
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,011
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

355
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,013
You ain't even ask me
if she can
come on over here!

356
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,431
One day! Morrill!

357
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,434
Can't we go one day
without your mouth? One!

358
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,939
Let it be today.

359
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,616
I'm sorry. You got to
forgive my old lady.
She...

360
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,536
You just a little bit
easy on the eyes,

361
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,497
and she's just
the jealous type,
you know, so...

362
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,374
Crazy type
is more like it.

363
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,961
What? You want to
watch your tongue, Agatha?

364
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,046
Sorry.

365
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,797
Or you want me
to take off my belt?

366
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,883
AGATHA: All right.

367
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,386
(LAUGHS)

368
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,554
Kids.

369
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,935
It's rough.
It's hard running a family.

370
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,649
It's important though
that you have one.

371
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,902
I have a family.
I have a husband.

372
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,238
Oh. You got a husband?
Is he here?

373
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,158
They let him bring you in here
with you when you came?

374
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,327
No.

375
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,038
Yeah, I had a husband, too.

376
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,502
Eighteen years
is a long time to wait.

377
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,801
So, you know,
if this ain't for you,
that's cool.

378
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,185
Then you pick up that
nasty oil, and take it out
and put it in the repository.

379
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,020
Okay.

380
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,801
We gotta go, bro.

381
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:24,976
Get your hand off me.

382
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,477
When I'm good
and ready.

383
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,647
What's Burrows doing
by the fence?

384
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,117
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

385
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,425
Nobody here to help you
but yourself.
Are you gonna answer me?

386
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,136
You tried to kill me.

387
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,847
Wind it up, cons.
Back inside.

388
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,933
You, get back
to your detail now.

389
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,248
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

390
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,378
What he's paying his people
to dust that Tancredi chick
in bitch pop,

391
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,963
my woman will do it
for a cut rate.

392
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,885
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

393
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:45,431
Tell him, if he's offered
100 grand,
my girl will take 30.

394
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,810
No, 40, 40.

395
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,231
Perfect. I'll tell him.

396
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,531
Hey, five-star.

397
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,830
So, you have no cash
whatsoever?

398
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,794
I'm sorry. I couldn't
hear you over the sound
of that broken record.

399
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,467
Got it.

400
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,471
I won't ask again.

401
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,188
DADDY: You act as stupid
as you look...

402
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,527
Oh. To what do
we owe the honor?

403
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,612
I've been thinking.

404
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,783
Well, no need to be shy,
just spit it out.

405
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,578
Changed my mind.

406
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,372
Yeah, well, maybe Daddy
changed her mind.

407
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,417
Maybe she don't want
you here anymore.

408
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,710
DADDY: Squirt's right.

409
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,754
I recently have
rolled up my welcome mat.

410
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,047
Peace.

411
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,347
Please.

412
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,724
Please what?

413
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,896
Please, may I be
a part of your family?

414
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,400
Take a walk.

415
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,944
Take a walk!

416
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,078
I would love that.
I... Sit down.
I really would.

417
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,876
But see, it's not that easy
as just saying, "I do."

418
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,758
See, you're making
a commitment to a family.

419
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,102
It's something
you gotta prove.

420
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,647
That's right.
We all did it.

421
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,408
DADDY: It's a commitment
to the family code.

422
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,205
It's a code you gotta wear.

423
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,710

(TIRES SQUEALING)

00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,394
Alex.

426
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,312
Hey, papi.
Hey, Sucre.

427
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,690
How you doing, Linc?

428
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,983
What's going on?

429
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,485
We gotta talk.

430
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,988
All right.

431
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,739
They're watching you.

432
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,283
We know.
We got a Fed on us.

433
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,160
No, not just one.
The whole department.

434
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,372
Sounds a lot like
inside information, Alex.

435
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,292
What did you do?
Make a deal with the Feds?

436
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,254
They offered me
my old job back if I came
down here to spy on you.

437
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,505
(CHUCKLES)

438
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,049
Now, the Fed
you're talking about,
his name is Wheatley.

439
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,134
He's running point.

440
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,260
So now we know.

441
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,639
So, if you're really
gonna do this,
you gotta do it right.

442
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,851
And I'll help you
if you need me.

443
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,314
What else did you get?

444
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,191
Sara was working
motor pool today at 4:00.

445
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,860
Motor pool is here,

446
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,528
visible by
two security cameras

447
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,946
along the perimeter
of the prison.

448
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,781
What about
secondary entrances?

449
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,451
No loading dock,
no personnel entrance.

450
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,619
Fences?

451
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,204
Fifteen feet high,
covered in razor wire.

452
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,457
SCOFIELD: Electrified?
SUCRE: No, why?

453
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:44,211
If Sara can get herself back
to motor pool, I think
we can find our way inside.

454
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,547
With all the different
retrofits over the years,

455
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,007
the fence line
was widened.

456
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,218
But the security cameras
remain exactly
where they've always been.

457
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,928
They never accounted
for the difference.

458
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,221
There's a blind spot.

459
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,223
Yeah. Right here.

460
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,768
If Sara can get back
to that spot,
we can breach the fence.

461
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,227
LINCOLN:
It's risky, Michael.

462
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,271
It's all we've got.

463
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,357
Now we just have to tell Sara
where we're going to meet her.

464
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,401
How? We got no visitation
and no phone calls.

465
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,953
It's clean.
Take it to Tancredi.

466
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,019
SCOFIELD:
Remember what I taught you
about flowers?

467
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,940
I wish I was with you now
to see you
holding one in your hand.

468
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,948
To see you
holding one in your hand.

469
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,926
Tomorrow, p.m.,
7:00, oil dump.

470
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,601
(DOOR OPENING)

471
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,574
Sure looks like
you've been busy.

472
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,075
You have a warrant,
Agent Wheatley?

473
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,411
(LAUGHS) A warrant.
No, I don't need one.

474
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,538
My testimony will be
that your brother let me in,

475
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:47,376
and once inside,
saw all this evidence
right in plain sight.

476
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,545
What judge
is gonna take your word
over mine?

477
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,130
What evidence?

478
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,798
Those pictures were taken
from public property,

479
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,760
and that prison was paid for
by the tax payers.

480
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,846
So all you have evidence of
is an exonerated citizen

481
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,974
standing on a public road
taking pictures
of a public building.

482
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,393
Last I checked,
it's not a crime.

483
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,354
What if I said that
I could get you on attempt

484
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,898
just for having
all this stuff?

485
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:12,193
What if I told you
that all of this
was a peace offering?

486
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,528
The warden
won't let me see my wife,

487
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,281
so I figured if I found
a few lapses in security,

488
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,700
pointed them out
as a gesture
of good faith,

489
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,118
she might change her mind.

490
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,536
Is that so?

491
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,163
Find anything yet?

492
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,915
No, looks airtight.

493
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,000
You sure about that?

494
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:32,421
Nothing that some
scumbag can exploit?

495
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,049
Airtight.

496
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,635
Well, thank goodness
for that.

497
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,304
But you guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?

498
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,556
You'll be the first
to know.

499
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,727
I won't keep you.

500
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:03,327
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done
no matter what.

501
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,162
I got paid well for it.

502
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,747
Now I'm broke.

503
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,624
But I still need things.

504
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,959
Like what?

505
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,460
A favor?

506
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,295
I don't do favors
for cons.

507
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,091
Really? It's not
what it says
on the bathroom wall.

508
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,428
As I understand, you do favors
for those who reciprocate.

509
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,601
Is that true?

510
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,486
Hey, this is bullshit, boss.

511
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,030
I'm gonna
fight her out here.

512
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,660
Ain't no reason to toss me.

513
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,997
You... Hey...
You know me.

514
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,960
Looky, looky here.

515
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,671
No, that brown
ain't mine, boss.
You know this.

516
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,256
I don't do no drugs.

517
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,425
Who put that in there?

518
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,471
You... Get your hands off me.
I know where the hole is.

519
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,807
What you looking at?

520
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,809
I don't do no drugs.

521
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,980
Somebody is going down
for this.

522
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,899
I love you, too.

523
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,527
Sofia is making arrangements
in Central America.

524
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,654
Once you break Sara out,
we're on a boat
and we're gone.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

526
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,700
Hey.
It's Blue.

527
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,243
Just got the decision
from the court.

528
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:29,163
They are ordering the warden
to allow
supervised visitation.

(SIGHS)

530
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,709
Where you going?
They're letting me see Sara.

531
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,669
Wait up, wait up, wait up.

532
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,588
They're going to be
listening to
every word you say.

533
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,173
You gotta be careful
about this.

534
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,718
If she understood my letter,
she'll find a way to tell me.

535
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,929
How? She gonna
blink Morse code?

536
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,915
Oh, my God.

537
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,253
Oh, my God.

538
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,047
Who did this to you?

539
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm okay. Baby's okay.

540
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,385
Sara, I'm so sorry.

541
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,680
You're in here
because of me.

542
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,519
I'm sorry.
It's just hard.

543
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,313
I miss you so much.

544
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,648
No touching.

545
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,361
I miss you, too.

546
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,907
You just have to
hang in there, okay?

547
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,078
I'm trying,
but my protection's gone.

548
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,000
Did you get my letter?

549
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,126
I did.

550
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,296
I know sometimes
it's hard for me to express
what I wanna say,

551
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,050
but I hope you understood
what I meant to tell you.

552
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,636
I did.

553
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,182
Is he getting cute?

554
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,893
You were there for me.

555
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,187
I will be there for you.

556
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,565
Okay.

557
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,483
All right, that's it.

558
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,610
Time's up.

559
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,780
See you soon.

560
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,621
Bye.

561
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,890
WOMAN OVER PA: Attention
all inmates and visitors.
Visiting hours are now over.

562
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,600
Please proceed
immediately to the exit.

563
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,976
Michael.

564
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,733
I was thinking a lot
about the photos
and the mockup

565
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,111
that you showed me
at the loft,
and I ran a few tests.

566
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,697
Lo and behold,
I found a blind spot

567
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,659
right along
the fence line over here
due to a retrofit.

568
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,830
You didn't know about this,
did you?
No. No, of course not.

569
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,417
Because you would've told me
or the warden about it
if you did. Right?

570
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,628
It's a good thing
I found this when I did

571
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,005
before anyone
tried to escape.

572
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,855
Well, if we can't go
through the fence, then
that leaves under or over.

573
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,025
Look, how's she gonna
climb that fence
without being seen? Huh?

574
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,070
I'm guessing
there's no telephone wire
for her to climb across.

575
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,822
Then she's gotta
go under.

576
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,698
All right.
Let's get some shovels.

577
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,784
What was that
you were saying
about parachutes?

578
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,244
MAHONE: Parachutes?

579
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,664
Guys, come on.
You can't be...
Parachutes?

580
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,790
MAHONE:
A couple of thoughts
on that.

581
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,793
A, we don't have a plane.
B, we don't have a pilot.

582
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,086
Have you ever
worn a parachute?

583
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,797
Don't worry.
I think I've got a plan.

584
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,092
But we're gonna need
some help
from an old friend.

585
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,593
Who?

586
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,971
You want a favor from me.

587
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,556
Just hear me out.

588
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,518
Of course, I mean,
when you and Michael
sent me back to that prison,

589
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,979
you did give me
a piece of chewing gum.

590
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,898
I mean, what kind of man
would I be if I didn't
quid your pro quo.

591
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:30,821
Look, all you gotta do is
set off the fire alarm in here
tomorrow night at 7:30.

592
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,490
That's it.

593
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,325
You're breaking her out?

594
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,578
Krantz has put
a hit on her.

595
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,582
It's our one shot
of keeping her alive.

596
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,085
Well, you're in a pickle
covered in jam, Lincoln.

597
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,839
We'll put five grand
in your kick once
this whole thing jumps off.

598
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,342
The love of Michael's life.
That's only worth $5,000?

599
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,760
It's the best we can do.

600
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,846
I need six figures.

601
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,181
It's all we've got.

602
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,767
Well, lucky day for you,
I know somebody who does.

603
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,060
The General's man.

604
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,441
He's got the payout
for Sara's hit.

605
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,320
You wire that money to me
by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow,

606
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,988
and we're in business.

607
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,072
What's his name?

608
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,200
Get your brother
to use that noggin of his.

609
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,409
Come on, you gotta give me
more than that.

610
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,204
Tomorrow, 7:00 p.m.
Go on, fetch.

611
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:41,683
You're a tough girl
to get alone.
I know he's breaking you out.

612
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,894
I'm coming with you.

613
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,984
Relax.

614
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,737
Krantz sent me to kill you,
but after what
he's put me through,

615
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,197
I'm done taking orders
from him.

616
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,491
You were sitting
next to me in the mess
when I was poisoned.

617
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,410
You think you would've
lasted this long
if I wanted you dead?

618
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,329
I want you dead.
You're still alive.

619
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,123
You think it's hard to
stay alive when you know
who's coming after you?

620
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,542
There's 200 women
in this prison.

621
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,004
Could you even
get out of Gen Pop?

622
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:19,096
I'm coming with you
or nobody's going.

623
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,524
(SNIFFING)

624
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,875
You should've seen the look
on Michael's face

625
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,586
when he saw me
fixing that fence and
installing that camera.

626
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,299
You did a great job.

627
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,051
Well, job's over now.

628
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:03,140
If Michael has this
misguided belief that
Sara's life is in danger,

629
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,601
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

630
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,396
Your job won't be over
until you give us
enough evidence

631
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,398
to put him back
behind bars.

632
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:13,942
So, what's the latest?

633
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,613
There's nothing concrete,
but I'll let you know
when I get something.

634
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:19,698
All right.

635
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,533
Good man.

636
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,517
(SIGHS)

637
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:53,482
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad, because
that means you're safe.

638
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,659
How does he think
he's gonna
do this, bro?

639
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:05,869
He's gonna jump out
of a plane.

640
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,372
I know he's gonna jump,
but the question is,
can he land?

641
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,623
Not without
getting caught.

642
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,208
And how's
he gonna get her out
of the cell block?

643
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,376
Even if T-Bag...

644
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,627
It's a big "if."

645
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,921
Trusting T-Bag
is just crazy.

646
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,133
Michael, we really
have to rethink this.

647
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,803
I have, and there's
no other way.

648
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,766
Okay, I'm gonna drop down
into this outer area here,

649
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,352
and I'll cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

650
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,812
They're gonna be
right on your ass.

651
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,314
I can hide
behind this building,
wait for a window.

652
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,233
And I'll make my way
over here.

653
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,278
That's the chapel,
where hopefully
Sara will be waiting.

654
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,363
LINCOLN: Why the chapel?

655
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,572
During a riot in '88,

656
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,075
prison employees escaped
through the
administration building

657
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,869
and wound up here,
outside the fence.

658
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,540
The administration building
is connected to the chapel,

659
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,167
which means that
somewhere in that compound

660
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,294
there's
a subterranean exit.

661
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,714
If we can get through it,
you can meet us there.

662
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,134
How's Sara
gonna get to the chapel?

663
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,219
She'll have to
find a way.

664
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,055
Look, we're doing this
at 7:00 p.m. tonight
just like we planned.

665
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,725
Where have you been?

666
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,935
What did I miss?

667
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,771
I need you to find
a plane and a pilot.

668
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,606
And I need you two
to take care of T-Bag.

669
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,277
Find out exactly
who has this money and
where they're keeping it.

670
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,778
And then
we have to get it.

671
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,864
By 7:00 p.m. tonight,

672
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,702
or Sara's gonna die in there.

673
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,537
Is everybody onboard?

674
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,038
Yeah.
Yeah.

675
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,415
Okay.

676
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,422
Tell me you've completed
your assignment.

677
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:46,136
Well, I've got the cash,
but there may be
some delay in final delivery.

678
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,556
The woman we hired
is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

679
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,184
Then hire somebody else.
Call it open season.

680
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,311
Put a bounty on her head.
I don't care how you do it.

681
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,939
I want Sara Tancredi dead
by the end of the day.

682
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,777
GUARD: Open cell, one hour.

683
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,835
Yo, we're about to play cards.
Do you want in?

684
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,630
I'm okay, thanks.

685
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,926
You should. With Daddy gone,
you gonna need your backup.

686
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,388
Hell, we all do.

687
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,059
I've got a prenatal thing.

688
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,853
It's cool.
Thanks.

689
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,773
Not too smart, though,
for a girl with
a bounty on her head.

690
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,944
Or ain't you heard?

691
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,740
Tancredi, you have
a visitor.

692
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,787
Say hello to
your husband for me.

(DOOR BUZZING)

694
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,134
What's wrong?

695
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:15,433
Look, I know you don't
have any control
over what's happened here,

696
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:19,604
but things
aren't working out.

697
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,149
Okay.

698
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:32,200
I've been trying to
find a way to do this,

699
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,956
but from where
we stand right now
there's only one option.

700
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,333
Do you need more time
to think?

701
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:45,130
No. No, it's not that.
I've made up my mind.

702
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,426
There's really nothing
you can do about it,

703
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,762
except
pray for us tonight.

704
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,390
Pray for us?

705
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,853
You can pray for us
to be together.

706
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,355
Maybe I'll do the same.

707
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,779
How can I rob someone
if I have no clue
who he is?

708
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:14,909
The log book outside says
that Krantz had one visitor
yesterday. Joe Daniels.

709
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,120
Well, using the power
of deduction,

710
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,289
I'd say Daniels
is your bagman.

711
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,542
You know how many Daniels
live in Miami?
Thousands. I need more.

712
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:26,338
Well, you better get cracking,
'cause if I ain't
got that money by 7:00,

00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,132
you ain't got your fire,
you ain't got
your fire alarm,

714
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,967
and that means Pretty
ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

715
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:34,679
Listen, my friend,
you're in no position
to make demands.

716
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:39,392
(SHUSHING) Okay.
I ain't talking about
backing out of the deal.

717
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,520
I'll put my ear to the ground
and come up with some details.

718
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,899
Good. Now go fetch.

We got a pilot.

721
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,079
It's a guy I busted
20 years ago running drugs
across the Gulf.

722

Went legit,
runs a charter business now.

723
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,166
You must've jumped out
of a few planes, huh?

724
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,878
Yeah. Several.
Some for sport,
some necessity.

725
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,047
It's a big difference,
Michael.

726
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,008
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

727
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,886
Don't worry.
I can go alone.

What do you got?

729
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,390
It's a test.

730
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,393
See, the prison
was built in the mid '80s,

731
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,103
so that exit in
the administration building

732
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,523
is probably protected
by an electronic coded lock

733
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,733
modified by
a security card.

734
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:33,113
Those locks don't have
power protection, which means
you can override them.

735
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,448
And you can't just
go to the building's
generator and blow it out?

736
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:40,495
No, a 1,200 volt power surge
will just set off
the other alarms.

737
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,123
Not to mention
maybe kill you.

738
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,629
It's why we have to
find another way.

00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,146
Got any ideas?

846
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,314
Yeah.

847
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,151
Keep your head down
and follow me.
I'll think of something.

of something fast

keep walking.

I hope you're ready
for a fight, princess.
This one's to the death.

852
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,688
Do you think
you can overpower her?

853
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,151
Yeah.

854
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,363
I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

855
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,366
Just be ready.

Hello.

858
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,672
It's me. I got the message
about the birthday present.

859
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,424
Was the gift earned?

860
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,259
What in the hell
are you talking about?

861
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,719
The birthday present.

862
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:40,970
The birthday present?

863
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,305
Two guys showed up
at my house,

864
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,725
they took the money
and they
beat the crap out of...

865

Howdy, General.

866
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,074
I just thought
I'd let you know
I came into some green.

867
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:08,247
My personal preference
is two Zagnut bars
and a copy of The Times.

868
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,375
So I'll see you
in the a.m.

869
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:15,588
You worthless
son of a whore.
Go to hell!

870

Careful I don't
get there first,

871
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,761
lest I become king
of that prison, too.

872
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,730
All right, from takeoff
to prison's
gonna come up real fast.

873
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,274
So whatever
you got to do
to get ready, do it now.

874
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,525
We got it.

875
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,904
You got the money?

876
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,073
Sucre just dropped me off
on the way to wire him.

877
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,700
Good. That means
T-Bag's set.

878
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:48,329
I'm gonna see
how long it's gonna
take him to get going.

879
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,499
You sure that thing's
gonna hold you up?

880
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,459
Yeah, it'll be fine.

881
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,710

882
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,838
It's not my first time
inside a prison.

883

it'll be my last.

be able to tell your kid.

our dad never was.

Unless you've got details,
I'm hanging up.

You can forget about
getting your badge back.

891
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,087
He's got a plane.
He's gonna
parachute into the yard.

892
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,630
What?
Yeah. I swear to God.

893
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,967
He's gonna be over
prison airspace at 7:00.

894
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,684
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs
in the yard.

895
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,644
And be ready to turn off
all exterior lights.

896

Scofield won't see
what's coming
until it's too late.

897

Wait. Wait.

01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,119
What you think
happened with Agatha,
it's not what happened.

900
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,663
I need to make this
right with you, okay?

901
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,039
Go ahead.

902
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,209

I'd see you here.

one big juicy favor.

905
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,552
I swear to God, she wanted
to kill me and I was
just defending myself.

906
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,554
Remember this?
Yes, I do.

907
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,764
My mama gave me that.

908
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,811
Told me I was going to
give it to
one of my kids one day.

909
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:39,899
I never did get knocked up.
But I grew up a family.

910
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:44,987
And I practically
raised Agatha.
She was no killer.

911

that much for myself.

01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,263
that door can only
be opened remotely
from the central control room.

1015
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,807
That's why we had
to ask for help.

1016
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:17,642
T-Bag.

1017
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,981
Tell them
what you told me.

1018
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:27,027
Michael Scofield's about
to stage a prison break.

1019
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,822
And I know exactly
how he's going to do it.

1020
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:35,744
Exactly what did
Scofield ask you to do?

1021
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:40,791
Just light a fire in my cell,
and the rest will
just take care of itself.

1022
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,503
Fire alarm.
When that goes off,
what's your protocol?

1023
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,379
State law,
mandatory evac.

1024
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,216
Yeah, he wasn't gonna
break her out, he was gonna
get you to escort her out.

1025
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,510
Shut up.
Get him out of here.

1026
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:55,889
All right. Evacuation's only
going to get him
out in the yard.

1027
01:13:55,973 --> 01:14:00,060
Whatever he's up to,
he needs noise
and he needs chaos.

1028
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,395
Deactivate
the smoke detector system,
the fire alarm,

1029
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,648
and while you're at it,
kill the horn.

1030
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:08,193
If anybody so much
as bends a blade of grass
in this place,

1031
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,487
I want to be able
to hear it.

1032
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,286
What are we waiting for?

1033
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,830
We made a deal.

1034
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:23,792
For the right price,
T-Bag would set off
the fire alarms.

1035
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,801
(ALARM STOPS)

1036
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:37,681
That's what
we were waiting for.

1037
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,236
Michael, there's a...

1038
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,320
It's okay.

1039
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:56,032
See, there's only one thing
you can count on when
you're dealing with T-Bag.

1040
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,492
He's a rat.

1041
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:01,997
Anything?

1042
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,748
So far, just
a female inmate
loose in the yard.

1043
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:04,833
Tancredi?

1044
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,334
No, Morgan,
first name, Gretchen.

1045
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,502
Over by the chapel.

1046
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:08,753
All right.

1047
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,513
SCOFIELD: All right.

1048
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,685
Great. Let's go.

1049
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,111
Okay, down there.

1050
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:50,503
Okay.

1051
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:55,217
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

1052
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,551
On the other end
of that is Linc,

1053
01:15:56,636 --> 01:16:01,097
and after that there's a boat
bound for white sand
and blue water.

1054
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:07,938
I'll power-surge this system.
It will override the reader
for just a few seconds,

1055
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:11,608
just long enough for you
to open the hatch,
so get ready.

1056
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:17,489
Three, two, one.

1057
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,494
One more time.

1058
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,580
Three, two, one.

1059
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,590
I was afraid
this might happen.

1060
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,259
That's okay.
It's all right.

1061
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,679
We're gonna keep moving
and we're gonna find
another way out of here.

1062
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,932
I know what I have to do.

1063
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,951
I need units
to the chapel now.

1064
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,536
POLICEMAN:
Unit five-three, ten-four.

1065
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,628
Where are they?
I don't know.

1066
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,172
They should have
been here by now.

1067
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:22,345
The battery wasn't
generating enough power.

1068
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,724
We have to blow the system
for the whole building.

1069
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,563
Okay, what do
you want to try?

1070
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:38,361
This is the main fuse.
If I yank that, everything
will go dark for a second.

1071
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,239
If I reconnect
these two cables...

1072
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:47,162
If I reconnect
these two cables,
there'll be a lot of noise.

1073
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,788
Every light bulb
in this place
is gonna blow.

1074
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,666
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

1075
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,877
And then I want you to
start running.

1076
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,129
Okay. What about you?

1077
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,553
Michael?

1078
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,139
Sara...

1079
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:12,270
Someone has to stay here,
and someone
has to open the hatch.

1080
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,065
And that someone's
got to be you.

1081
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,734
Okay. So I'll leave it
open for you.

1082
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:21,613
You don't understand.
This is the only way.

1083
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:31,039
I'm not leaving unless
you're coming with me.

1084
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,126
I am coming with you.

1085
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:43,635
I love you.

1086
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,721
God! I love you too.

1087
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,434
(BANGING ON DOOR)

1088
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:52,977
Go.

1089
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:56,940
Go, Sara. Go.

1090
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,548
Downstairs.

1091
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,569
Where's Michael?

1092
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,908
Sara, where's...
Where's Michael?

1093
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:31,826
Where is he?

1094
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,426
He's not coming back.

1095
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,097
(LINCOLN BREATHING HEAVILY)

1096
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,059
He's not coming back.
What?

1097
01:20:56,143 --> 01:21:00,146
What do you mean,
he's not coming back?
What do you mean by that?

1098
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,026
He's not coming back.

1099
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:12,617
LINCOLN: He'll be here.

1100
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,121
He's gone, Linc.

1101
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,798
Linc, we got to go.

1102
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:30,927
We got to go.

1103
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:51,823
MAHONE: We got to go.

1104
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,984
GUARD: The gates are gonna
be open in a minute.

1105
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:32,030
T-BAG: Why am I
being punished?

1106
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,616
I'm the guy
who blew the whistle.

1107
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,868
You aided and abetted
an escape, Mr. Bagwell.

1108
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,788
As far as the authorities
are concerned,
you're an accomplice.

1109
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:43,833
Scofield!

1110
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,919
Scofield!

1111
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:53,801
Scofield!

1112
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,328
Michael asked me
to give you this
if he didn't make it out.

1113
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:24,207
He said it would
help you understand
why he did what he did.

1114
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,213
It's his blood work.

1115
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,072
This is
the General's money.

1116
01:23:56,573 --> 01:24:00,952
I was supposed to
wire it down to Costa Rica
for you to pick up, but

1117
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:03,788
I ran into some trouble.

1118
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:06,582
I'm sorry.

1119
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:12,171
You take care
of that baby, okay?

1120
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:14,173
You take care
of yours.

1121
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:43,995
This is for you.

1122
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,665
He never said
anything to me.

1123
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,043
Why didn't
he just tell me?

1124
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,422
Because he knew
you'd try to stop him.

1125
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,883
He knew you'd do anything
to protect your family.

1126
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,426
But I didn't.

1127
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,600
MAHONE: Well,

1128
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:08,686
you will soon.

1129
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:13,816
Take it easy.

1130
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:24,285
Sara.

1131
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,997
Thank you.

1132
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,584
Yeah.

1133
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,571
(SIGHS)

1134
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,127
Well, if you're
watching this,
I'm glad,

1135
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,712
because it means
you're safe.

1136
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,593
And that's all I ever wanted.

1137
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,806
I wish I could
be there with you.

1138
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,937
But as you probably know now,
I wouldn't have had
much time anyway.

1139
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,524
So, I made my choice,

1140
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,278
and I don't regret it.

1141
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,033
Anyway, not too long from now

1142
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:49,537
there's going to be
another little Scofield
running around.

1143
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:53,082
And, Linc, I want
you to promise me,

1144
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:57,962
no matter what, they're going
to grow up knowing
their uncle’s never far away.

1145
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:04,218
And Sara, I want you to
promise me that you're
gonna keep an eye on Linc.

1146
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,972
As you may have noticed,
he has a tendency
to get in trouble.

1147
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,307
(LAUGHS)

1148
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:19,942
You know, we spend so much
of our lives not saying
the things we want to say.

1149
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,653
The things we should say.

1150
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,742
We speak in code
and we send
little messages, origami.

1151
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:32,496
So now, plainly and simply,

1152
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:37,126
I want to say
that I love you both

1153
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:41,255
very much.

1154
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:48,512
And I want you to promise me
that you're going to
tell my child...

1155
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:55,186
That you're going to
tell my child how much
they're loved every day.

1156
01:27:55,687 --> 01:28:00,024
And remind them
how lucky they are
to be free.

1157
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,361
Because we are.

1158
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:06,447
We're free now.

1159
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,950
Finally.

1160
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,287
We're free.
