There's nothing you can do.
I'd run if I could run.

Mr. Prime Minister, I too lost a son,
when he was just a child.

Was your son murdered
by an assailant's bullet?

Of course not.

However, if I keep one promise,
I have to keep them all.

...she'd wanna meet
with one of their emissaries.

She could still be in Miami,
maybe at the embassy.

No, she's not at the embassy.

435

Any deal she makes with India
will be off the radar.
