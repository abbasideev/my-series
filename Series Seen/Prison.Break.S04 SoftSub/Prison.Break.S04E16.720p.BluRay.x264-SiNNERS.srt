I think you meant it as a metaphor.

184
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,440
For what?
That the ends justify the means?

with your mother's philosophy.

-Just a few conversations.

00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,414
Let me guess.
You two had some kind of moment...

00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,500
...at the Company Christmas party?

191
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,003
I've known your mother for years.

you've got the same brilliant mind...

...and same sense of humor
for that matter.

194
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,596
I'm guessing this isn't about
my sense of humor.

195
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,059
She was just as resistant
to joining the Company.

196
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,561
But then she learned the truth.

197
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:19,316
If the truth is that the Company is
all about saving the world, I don't buy it.
