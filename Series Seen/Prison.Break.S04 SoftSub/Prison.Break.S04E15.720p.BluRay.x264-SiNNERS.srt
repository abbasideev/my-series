00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,877
MICHAEL:
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,011
LINCOLN:
Michael!

3
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,224
Scylla is complete.

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,769
GRETCHEN: What the hell are you doing?
-Buyer's already on the way.

5
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,649
Yeah, I got one. It's Bagwell.

6
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,069
There is no meeting
with the attorney general, is there?

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,114
He's sick, Lincoln.
If they haven't killed him already.

8
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,699
We'll get him back. I promise.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,367
KRANTZ:
Michael needs an operation...

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,786
...to remove a tumor
from his temporal lobe.

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,539
And the price
is the safe return of Scylla.

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,458
LINCOLN: What's this?
-Added incentive.

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,967
What's going on? Where's Michael?

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,177
Michael needs surgery.
He's gonna get it.

15
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,263
-Where?
-Here.

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,849
What?

17
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,684
Krantz has arranged for doctors.

18
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,352
We can't let them near him.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,021
Out of time. It's our last option.

20
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,692
I don't understand
why the Company would help him.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,736
Dr. Tancredi. Welcome.

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,531
Please.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

23
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,326
-All we want is to help.
-You're gonna save Michael?

24
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,162
You question our capabilities?

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,164
No, I'm questioning your motives.

26
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:26,753
When a fellow human being is suffering,
why would we not want to lend a hand?

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,629
Empathy, Sara.

28
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,883
It's the only thing
that separates us from the beasts.

29
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,929
For the duration of the surgery,
he'll be treated as a guest in my home.

30
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,432
And afterwards?

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,393
Sir, the patient is ready.

32
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,689
LINCOLN:
It's gonna be all right, Sara.

33
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,149
Trust me.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,786
Mr. Scofield, although you're
going to be anesthetized...

35
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,497
...and should feel no significant pain...

36
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,000
...we will need to keep you awake
for the duration of the procedure.

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,418
As a safety precaution...

38
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,798
...we'll need to continually monitor
your speech and sensory activity...

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,719
...to insure the tissue being removed
will not leave you impaired in any way.

40
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,638
What hospital is this?

41
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,181
Don't worry about it.

42
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,726
You've got some good doctors
who are gonna take great care of you.

43
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,813
I have to get Scylla.

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,731
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

45
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,650
Not now.

46
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,694
-Where's Linc?
-He's here.

47
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,113
And he's just fine.

48
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,825
I'm not leaving
until Michael has surgery.

49
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,995
I'm not starting surgery until you prove
you can hold up your end of the deal.

50
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,582
Scylla's slipping through our fingers
as we speak.

51
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,170
Time is not on our side
nor on your brother's.

52
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,340
Now, you'll get full cooperation
from my office.

53
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,676
You need anything,
just call this number.

54
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,512
I'm gonna need everything you got
on Self and Gretchen.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,806
Aliases. Whatever you got.

56
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,226
How about an accomplice?

57
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,113
-Now, if you’re gonna want--
-Shut up.

58
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,407
You'll save yourself pain
and embarrassment...

59
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,784
...if you just tell me where they are.

60
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,871
-Gretchen and Agent Turncoat?
-Yeah.

61
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,372
Information like that...

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,208
...seems like it could be
of certain intrinsic value.

63
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,420
If there were offers made,
carrots dangled...

64
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,130
...I could see my--

65
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,676
I deserve some kind of something here.
All the work I put in.

66
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,221
If it wasn't for me finding Whistler's
bird book then where would--

67
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,973
[GRUNTS]

68
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,352
The only thing you deserve
is the opportunity to keep your teeth...

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,314
-...and your fingernails.
-You do this, I'm not gonna tell you any--

70
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,274
Aah! Ugh.

71
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,444
I'm gonna pull out every single tooth,
every single one.

72
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,779
How about it?

73
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,781
Look, I was just fooling-- Aah!

74
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,366
LINCOLN: Tell me!
-Arlington Pier.

75
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,452
Arlington-- Arlington Pier.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,871
When? What time?

77
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,248
Three o'clock.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,338
This is the last of the anesthetic.

79
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,757
From here on out,
you shouldn't feel a thing.

80
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,217
I'm gonna be right over there
the whole time.

81
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,386
I'll be right in here the whole time.

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,557
We're ready.

83
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,314
I'm not gonna leave you, okay?

84
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,774
Don't you dare leave me.

85
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,379
NURSE: EEG is calibrated.
DOCTOR: Are we ready to commence?

86
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,299
How many surgeries
has your team performed...

87
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,968
...using the gamma knife?

88
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,554
The gamma knife has a recurrence rate
of over 13 percent.

89
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,891
We'll be using a technique
that's more advanced.

90
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,687
[DRILL WHIRRING]

91
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,732
-What's going on?
-They're gonna operate.

92
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,608
Just like that? They agreed to?

93
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,403
I convinced them Michael knew
who was gonna buy Scylla.

94
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,156
-What are we gonna do now?
-Get our hands on it.

95
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,116
-And give it to who?
-Still working on that.

96
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,160
-I need to know why.
-To finish this!

97
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,163
Really?
Because it feels like it's finishing us.

98
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,750
You, me, we're the only ones left, bro.

99
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,754
One more day and we're done.
I can't do this without you.

100
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,524
GRETCHEN: When the buyer gets here,
let me do the talking.

101
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,817
SELF:
For what?

102
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,987
I engineered this whole thing.
I can handle my business.

103
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,363
Oh, yeah?

104
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,618
Start by handling that river of nerves
that's running down your forehead.

105
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,370
-Did you think this would be easier?
-I hoped.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,540
I guess I knew it was gonna come down
to a pile of bodies.

107
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,419
-I never pegged you for a killer.
-Yeah, I never pegged you for a mom.

108
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,009
Is there anything
that you'd like to peg me for, Don?

109
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,220
Oh, stop, okay?

110
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,014
Don't embarrass yourself.
It may work on everyone else.

111
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,142
But the only thing I'm thinking about
is that 125 million.

112
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,896
So close up your blouse, open your eyes,
because the buyer's on the way.

I don't want any surprises

-How much longer?
-Another hour or so.

115
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,205
Just sit tight.

116
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,832
I need to use the men's room.

117
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,334
WHEELER: Congratulations.
-Do you think I'm gonna run?

118
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,629
-That's exactly what I think.
-You want me to go right here?

119
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,048
Have respect for my intelligence,
Alex.

120
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:50,177
I do, which is why I know
you wouldn't violate Code 42-13-72B...

121
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,265
...which states that an individual being
transported by the justice system...

122
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,226
...must be afforded the opportunity
to relieve himself...

123
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,604
...if the duration of the transport
is more than three hours.

124
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,023
I do believe we're creeping up
on that time.

125
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,484
All right, I'll see what I can do.

126
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,279
But I'm gonna remind you of a code.
The one that says:

127
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,990
"If a prisoner attempts escape
during transfer...

128
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,159
...the accompanying agent
has the right...

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,578
...to shoot him
through the back of the head."

130
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,039
You sure you don't wanna hold it,
Alex?

131
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,168
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

132
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,134
Any pain or discomfort, Mr. Scofield?

133
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,844
No.

134
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,431
Those needles,
they're for stabilization?

135
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,308
Not exactly.

136
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,059
Throughout the surgery...

137
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,229
...portions of Michael's cerebral cortex
will be stimulated...

138
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:46,483
...triggering the areas that control senses
like hearing, smell, memory.

139
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,987
That's why some people,
right before death often speak of--

140
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,365
-Their life flashing before their eyes.
-Exactly.

141
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,994
When oxygen is cut off to the brain,
it kicks into overdrive...

142
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,290
...tapping into every resource
to continue operating the body.

143
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,792
As a result,
all of the senses fire off at once.

144
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,672
Everything you've ever known,
felt, believed...

145
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,759
...it all passes in a blink of an eye.

146
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,130
Hello, Michael.

147
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,933
Charles.

148
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,813
I guess
you could probably call me D.B. now.

149
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,564
Heh.

150
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,571
The answer is no.

151
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,990
The answer?

152
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,033
You're wondering if you’re dead.

153
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,743
The answer is no.

154
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,997
Then why am I here?

155
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:29,003
I believe that's a question
we all need to find the answer to.

156
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:41,015
This is now the most secure bathroom
break in the history of law enforcement.

157
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,725
Yes, it is.

158
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,144
If you wanna cuff me
and block off the exits...

159
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,938
...take it out and give it a tap
if it makes you happy.

160
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,024
Would that make you feel happy,
Alex?

161
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,692
I hear prison can change a man.

162
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,320
Could we just get this over with?

163
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,288
-All clear.
-You have 15 seconds.

164
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,193
Wasn't so bad now, was it?

165
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:42,159
You should've trusted me,
like I trusted you.

166
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,508
All right.

167
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,762
We're ready to begin
to isolate the tumor now, Mr. Scofield.

168
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,639
As we talked about...

169
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,059
...I'm gonna ask you
to slowly recite the alphabet.

170
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,311
If you have any problems

you built was deficient...

it isn’t just on the hypothalamus.

to the hippocampus as well.

will there be any memory loss?

Well, in cases like this, where
small portions have to be removed...

391
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,835
...it hardly ever affects
what's referred to as net memory.

00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,120
--something more?

515
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,038
Like what?

516
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,125
Something good.

517
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,504
Why go to so much trouble
to protect information about the past?

518
00:36:55,672 --> 00:37:01,010
Information the Company could
just delete anytime they wanted to.

519
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:02,761
The general said:

520
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,890
KRANTZ: For as long as we have Scylla,
we have power.

521
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,145
I don't think he was talking
about power, like control or influence.

522
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,022
I think he was talking about energy.

523
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,733
Boron.

524
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,109
Argon.

525
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,446
Gallium.

526
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,198
Indium.

527
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,034
"Bargain."

528
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,871
There's a theory
that if you can find a way...

529
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,917
...to combine these elements
into the design of a solar cell...

530
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,837
...you can harness
100 percent of the sun's energy.

531
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:43,052
With that kind of power,
possibilities are limitless.

532
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,388
It would certainly explain
all the security around Scylla.

533
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:53,437
They're not protecting the past.
They're protecting the future. Wow.

534
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,898
I wonder what else is on it. I mean--

535
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,984
The equipment,
and the drugs they gave you...

536
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,445
...none of it exists
on the open market.

537
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,907
Which would explain why
people would be willing to pay millions...

538
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,742
...to get their hands on Scylla.

539
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:12,122
It's not about taking down the Company.
It's about becoming the Company.

540
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,500
It's about knowing what they know.

541
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,627
Controlling what they know.

542
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,421
What do we do now?

543
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,554
So, what's the next move?

544
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,098
I'm gonna check on Michael.

545
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,266
No, I mean, after that?

546
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,353
Scylla's out there.
Are we really gonna keep chasing it?

547
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,647
I don't know. Figure it out later.

548
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,440
No.

549
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,609
I won't be here, Linc.

550
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,613
I can't do it anymore.

551
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,409
Sara said Mike was okay,
and that's all I needed to know.

552
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,036
But now I gotta go and live my life.

553
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,665
And that's the life where I can go a day
without seeing a dead body...

554
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,251
...or almost becoming one.

555
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:03,632
I'm not running away, papi.
I'm just moving on.

556
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,261
This was never about you.

557
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,638
Everything you did, you did for us.

558
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,766
I'll never forget that.

559
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,065
I know you got something cooking,
so whatever it is, just be careful, okay?

560
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,527
Yeah.

561
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,408
Thank you.

562
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,704
Hey.

563
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,333
When you and Mike get down below
and open that surf shop--

564
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,710
Scuba shop.

565
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,587
Scuba shop.

566
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,590
Maybe there will be a job there
for me.

567
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,841
You can count on it.

568
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,315
Do you know who took it?

569
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,817
No. But Self and Gretchen do.

570
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,069
Good.

571
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,363
-Then you've got your team.
-I'm not working for them.

572
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,909
You'll work with a hound in a hat
if that’s what I tell you to do.

573
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,162
That's what being an employee
means.

574
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,500
You're determined, and dedicated,
but there are holes in your résumé...

575
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,545
...that Gretchen, or Self,
or even Bagwell can fill.

576
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:28,258
Now, you all took something from me,
and you are all going to get it back.

577
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,594
Besides...

578
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,889
...you can't handle this by yourself.

579
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,267
And deep down I think you know that.

580
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,771
Have them meet me outside.

581
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,525
Who knows?

582
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,238
You may find that you like it here.
Stranger things have happened.

583
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,740
They've certainly happened
in your family.

584
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,036
Now, about Michael.

585
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,832
Are you gonna tell him...

586
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,750
...or should I?

587

Good. You know what to do.

591
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,494
Last time I saw you in a hospital,
you busted your arm in Little League.

592
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,539
Some bruiser knocked me down
sliding into second.

593
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,832
Sorry about that.

594
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,002
-But you healed good though, right?
-Yeah.

595
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,796
This will too.

596
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:53,302
Whatever plan you're working on to get
us out, we better make a move on it.

597
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,221
You're not getting out of here,
Michael.

598
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,434
What do you mean?

599
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,187
I made a deal,
your life in exchange for Scylla.

600
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,899
Why would you do that?

601
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:11,153
Same reason you covered your body
in tattoos, and broke into Fox River.

602
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,114
-This is not just about us.
-It's exactly what it's about.

603
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,241
It's all it's ever been about.

604
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,872
We do this one thing for the Company,
and they set us up for life.

605
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,874
And you actually trust them?

606
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,836
Who else am I gonna trust?
The government, guys like Don Self?

607
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,589
I'm done watching loved ones
and friends die, Michael.

608
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,508
Scylla's not we thought it was.

609
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,511
-Not even close.
-I don't care.

610
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,680
I don't understand
how you can say that.

611
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,933
The only thing worth fighting for
is family.

612
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,061
I'm gonna do everything
and anything I can to end this.

613
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,231
So you, me,
all of us can get on with our lives.

614
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,359
You think you can do that
knowing what you know?

615
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,903
You wanna know
what I know about the Company?

before she died.

I'm just moving on

-Linc, don't do this.
-It's done.
