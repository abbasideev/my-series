He got arrested? What happened?

167
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,915
It's a long story.

168
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,085
But we need you to get Mahone
and the device out. Can you do that?

169

What do you think,
every time you guys screw up...

170
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,465
...I can just magically
make things disappear?

171

We ain't interested in your excuses.
Can you do it or not?

I'll call you back.

Excuse me, who are you?
What is this?

174
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,892
I'm Brian. I work in the IT Department.

175
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,769
We're getting some
registry inconsistencies on the server...

176
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,981

a few routine spot checks.

-I have Level 2 clearance, see?

I fix their computers.

when you weren't here.

Well, you gotta go.
Don't come back in here.

-So, what's the word?
-Self's on it.

183
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,846
"On it," as in he's getting Mahone out?

184
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,349
-He said he'd handle it.
-What's there to handle?

185
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,227
Self yanked us all out of prison
for way bigger charges.

186
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,895
Getting Mahone out should be easy...

187

-Yeah.

It actually has huge holdings in Laos.

195

My car broke down
in the middle of the desert.

And, uh, there was no one around
for miles...

206
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,279

so I walked here.

that I sent from Germany?

208
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,994

00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:01,978
I tried accessing Self's user account but
he has a tricky firewall system in place.

There's no easy way to get past it,
not without drawing attention.

maybe Mahone is a standup guy...

to work an angle. I'm not sure.
