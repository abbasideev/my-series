00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,658
-Hi.
-Hey, are you all right?

00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,994
SARA:
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

508
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,955
Well, I was worried. Where are you?
Let me come and get you.

509
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,583
No, it's okay. I'm almost home.

510
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,251
Um....

511
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,673
Listen, you're what's keeping me going
right now.

512
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,303
And you're all I have left.
And that scares me.

513
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,016
I just wanna be together.

514
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:45,229
I know the circumstances
are a little less than ideal...

515
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:50,025
...but we are together.
You're here. I'm here.

516
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,195
It's not one day anymore. It's, um....

517
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,322
It's today.

518
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,997
Well, why don't you come back
and we'll make some dinner.

519
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,000
And maybe find
a little time for ourselves.

520
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,294
Yeah, I'll be right there.
