Don't you have
your Eagles and Angels luncheon?

342
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,269
I figured I'd skip it today.

You called me in here
to confirm my lunch plans?

either of us anymore.

I got a call from a friend.
Heard Scylla was in play.

364
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,402
He wants to know
if he can get in on it.

-He's prepared to offer 200.

-I don't know.

this morning...

380

...once we get over there,
if we make too much noise...

381
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,869

by the sensors on the other side.

All right.

388
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,622
We have to break through two walls,
one concrete and one glass...

389

...and do it without making a sound.

390
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:20,555
In order to get through that, we have
to generate an electromagnetic field.
