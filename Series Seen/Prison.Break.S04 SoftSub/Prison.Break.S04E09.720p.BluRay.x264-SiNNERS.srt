-Same thing. Bring down the Company.

-Are we partners?
-Partners.

-I want it moved. Move Scylla. Now!

We want General Krantz
to think Wyatt took us out.

as unplugging a laptop...

is one of the most secure we have.

We can't track him.

it's some wall or serious impediment.

go further until she gives them back.

The human body, when in

Brain activity decreases,
and your heart rate slows...

anymore.

Mr. White.

505
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,849
I'm sorry to bother you, but, uh,
after my talk with Detective Mara...

506
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,937
...uh, I was thinking about Mr. Blauner
and some of the conversations we had.

507
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,688
Salesmen are a lot like fishermen.

508
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,650
They're always bragging
about their big catch. Heh.

509
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,404
Well, old Andy never talked about
his sales, no matter how much I pried.

510
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:06,075
So I took the liberty...

511
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,035
...of looking them up.

512
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,540
And there were, to say the least...

513
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,585
...irregularities.

514
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,339
PFEIFFER:
Good afternoon to you too, Andy.

515
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,258
Two of your top buyers
don't have valid Social Security numbers.

516
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,636
I checked out
the Social Security numbers...

517
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,306
...of the clients
he allegedly sold GATE workshops to.

518
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,519
In some cases,
the numbers are just pure fabrications.

519
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,562
But the checks must have cleared.

520
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,984
He must've been money laundering for
God-only-knows-what criminal exploits.

521
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,944
The point is...

522
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,197
...if the good officer gets his hands
on these papers...

523
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,742
...you know you're gonna be
up to your eyeballs in IRS auditors.

524
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,414
I suggest you go tell Mr. Mara...

525
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,459
...that you found some irregularities
in Blauner's expenses.

526

Writing off personal matters,
et cetera.

527
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:06,301
This will explain why he disappeared
and will placate the po-po.

528
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,846
Okay.

529
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,773
Listen, detective,
we've discovered some discrepancies.

BELLICK: I can't. It's too heavy.

More important,
what's happening with Scylla?

00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,606
-I'll tell you in private.
-You can tell me in front of Gretchen.

But now that Wyatt's eliminated
Scofield and Burrows, there's no need.

Scofield and Burrows are dead?

Dead as Latin.

Go ahead with the plan.

If a couple of boys from Illinois can get
that close, it's time to mix things up.
