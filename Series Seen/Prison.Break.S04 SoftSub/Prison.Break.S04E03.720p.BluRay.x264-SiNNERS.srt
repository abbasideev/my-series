Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:05,546
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,507
-In exchange for?
-Scylla.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,551
These are GPS ankle monitors.
I'm your boss.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,846
And if I ask you to put on a monitor,
you put on the monitor.

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:17,183
MAHONE: Whistler's assignment was to
drop off Scylla to a Company executive.

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,185
And his job was to protect it.

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,563
When this is all done, you and me,
we're gonna settle up.

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,982
I'm looking for Alex.

in there. You don't wanna go in there.

13
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,083
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,378
I swear to you,
I have no idea where they are.

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,214
-What's wrong?
-Whatever it is, it ain't it.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,343
If Scylla was like a pizza,
all we got is a slice.

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,388
So Scylla isn't one card. It's six.

18
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,990
-Hey. What did you pull us into?
SELF: Excuse me?

19
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:18,995
Figured you'd get us on the hook so we
could find out how screwed this was.

20
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,956
-What the hell are you talking about?
-The card, Agent Self.

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,461
-I'm talking about the card. It's useless.
-Wait, hold on. You already got the card?

22
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,213
Yes, but without the other five cards,
it means nothing.

23
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,299
And I can only assume you knew that.

24
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,092
What other five?

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,179
Don't.

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,472
What other five?

27
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,477
Roland downloaded the card.
There's no Company data on the card.

28
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,062
So without the other five cards,
it's unreadable.

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,148
It's like one-sixth of the puzzle.

30
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,317
That's not my problem
because we had a deal.

31
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,153
-And we gave you what you asked for.
-No, you didn't.

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,072
We had a deal for you to get me Scylla
and you haven't.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,700
-You gave me your word.
-I'm giving you my word again.

34
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,621
You will go back to prison if
you can't get me those other five cards.

35
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,919
But if you can't get this done, just let
me know and we'll get your cell ready.

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,797
-You understand?
-I'll get it done.

BELLICK: Screw that, man.
We got the card.

Let's do the break-in and end this.

41
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,144
MICHAEL: Doesn't work that way.
-It's not fair, we did what he said.

42
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,439
Then call Agent Self,
tell him you wanna go back to Fox River.

43
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,652
Hell, we're all gonna go to prison
if we can't find the other cards.

44
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,198
When the government gets scared,
they tend to cut the cord.

45
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,367
Did Self talk about shutting us down?

46
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,829
Let's just concentrate on finding Scylla,
all right?

-Where is he going?
-Who cares?

49
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,716
How we gonna find Scylla?
We don't even know where to start.

50
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,971
-Where's the rest of the stuff you found?
-Still printing it up.

51
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,850
When my device was in Tuxhorn's
house, it must've been next to his PDA.

52
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,269
Sucked up data from it.
I got e-mails and photos.

53
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,522
-You see anything we can use?
-No, and let me be crystal clear.

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,483
I point and click.
Other than that, I'm off the clock.

00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,569
-Shut up.
MICHAEL: Wait. Where's his calendar?

56

There's nothing on it but a star.

59

meetings, who he's with, when, where.

60
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,251
-This is the only thing with nothing.
-Must be a reason he's keeping it secret.

61
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,337
Why are we letting Self call the shots?
We should play hardball.

62

From now on,
either help out or get out.

But not if you end this now.

Now 7-16 at 4 p.m."

Today's the 16th, but there's nothing
about London in his calendar.

Not that we've seen, no.

00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,023
-Nothing about travel to or from the U.K.?
-No, nothing.

115
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,818
Why would he get an e-mail
about an arrival in London...

00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,404
...when he has no business
scheduled there?

117
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,158
Probably because the e-mail is a code.

The meeting today at 4 is about Scylla.

120
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,922
Tuxhorn did not schedule a meeting
with himself...

121
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,717
...so that is where
we're gonna find our next cardholder.

Okay, so 4 p.m. is our when.
We need a where.

123
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,223
If you're having a secret meeting,
you don't send the information together.

124
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,518
You'd send the where and the when
separately as a precaution.

125
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,065
Were there other e-mails sent to Tuxhorn
at the same time as the London e-mail?

126
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,736
Within a few seconds of the London mail,
two more followed from the same IP.

127
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,448
My device ran out of space. It picked up
the IP address but not the content.

128
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,743
Trace the IP address.
Find out who sent the e-mails.

00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,580
E-mails get bounced to routers all over
the world before they end in your Inbox.

Wherever the mail's been,
it leaves a shadow file.

131
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,086
Based on the geography, I'd guess these
e-mails squatted at the Anaheim server...

132
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,424
...a nanosecond before reaching Tuxhorn.
That's where you're gonna find your file.

it's on a main server in Anaheim.

It is possible to find those e-mails
at that server?

We have to find that e-mail message.
