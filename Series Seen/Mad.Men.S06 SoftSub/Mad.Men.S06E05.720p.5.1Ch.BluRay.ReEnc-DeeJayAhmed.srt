1
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,397
1,290 square feet.

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,557
Let's call it 13 with the balcony.

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,120
One and a half bathrooms.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,590
That means it's a full bath
and a powder room.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,399
Two bedrooms, 1 1th floor...

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,915
one parking spot
with an option for a second.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,878
And at $28,000...

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,714
I do believe that was
everything on your list.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,395
It's a little farther east than I wanted.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,393
In fact, it's about
as far east as you could go.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,518
- You can see the highway from the corner.
- You could see the river.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,080
And who needs Central Park...

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,880
when you can smell the ocean
and the Hungarian bakeries?

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,077
Believe me, when they finish
the Second Avenue subway...

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,834
this apartment will quadruple in value.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,752
Oh, that's Barbara.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,354
You let me do the talking.

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,191
Sorry I'm late.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,079
It's quite a hike between First and York.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,038
It's got to be longer than a normal block.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,793
I don't think so.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,758
We just got started.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,672
What do you think?

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,229
I think no one's gonna catch
that doorman napping.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,676
I left your name.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,070
It's got a doorman.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,232
I was telling Peggy that an offer is
coming in at asking price.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,754
We'd have to beat it.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,593
So it's in your best interest
to be decisive...

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,399
and take this property seriously.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,870
Well, okay, but it's not my decision.

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,272
Ginny, we are taking this seriously.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,273
- What Abe means is-
- I'm more her trusted adviser.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,670
An interested party.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,797
I see.

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,600
I misunderstood.

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,036
I'm going to flush that toilet again.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,555
She didn't know I wasn't the buyer?

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,518
So all this time she was just being rude.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,796
Forget about her.

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,997
Is it too far east?

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,597
Dinner!

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,676
Bobby, Sally, let's go.

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,639
Look at you two. Heading to the track?

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,112
- Where are you going?
- D.C., if Jonesy can find a cab.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,874
- Hope you're not in a rush.
- We have a car coming.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,872
6!30? We should have done that.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,474
We're not going to miss the train.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,119
Where are you going?

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,838
They said D.C.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,991
I mean, why are you going?

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,869
Arnie was invited last minute
to give a keynote address.

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,553
Did you have to tell him
it was last minute?

54
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,075
I guess the point is
somebody more important fell out.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,072
It's a very distinguished group.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,153
And you must have been
at least as important.

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,677
Either way, it sounds like a good excuse
for a weekend in Washington.

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,152
Yes. Come Monday morning,
it'll all be a dream.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,596
We should really go away.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,558
Looks like you're going somewhere fun now.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,597
We are. Megan's up for an award.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,831
Good for you. Maybe tomorrow...

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,111
you'll be calling the producers
and asking for a raise.

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,634
No, it's for advertising.

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,234
The Ad Club of New York.

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,074
- Paul Newman's coming.
- My goodness.

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,958
You're really good at everything.

68
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,396
I was just a name on the team.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,039
There's the car.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,476
Well, break a leg.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,840
You too.

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,391
Oh, and, Don, we're going to D.C.

73
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,997
Hey, Pop, I-

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,433
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,079
We were waiting for you.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,597
Look, miss, whatever he told you
we were interested in, we're not.

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,951
See how funny he is?

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,839
Now, don't be rude.
This is Beverly Farber.

79
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,718
She is Chaim Farber's daughter.

80
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,953
I'm- Our dads, they play chess together.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,793
Oh-

82
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,590
Well- It's nice to meet you.

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,959
And now that you're home
from a busy day on Madison Avenue...

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,316
I think you should go out
and have some dinner.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,880
What?

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,272
Maybe we should do this another time.

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,194
Nonsense.
There's no time like the present.

88
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,476
You both should have some fun.

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,473
She's a schoolteacher.
She works all the time.

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,791
I need to shave,
change my clothes, prepare.

91
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,076
I mean, look at her. She had a jump on me.

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,990
I did.

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,039
I was led to believe
that you knew about this.

94
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,158
- Why did you tell her that?
- What's the difference?

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,756
Look at her.
I'm obviously doing you a disservice.

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,990
At least we're close to the kitchen.

97
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,675
It's not fair that
all the big agencies are up front.

98
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,319
Closer to their trophies.

99
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,119
But at least we're gonna eat before them.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,636
Oh, I see Peggy back there.
We should go say hello.

101
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,918
- I'm gonna wait for the group.
- You can't avoid her forever.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,879
I'm not.
Tell her that no matter what...

103
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,953
her laxative radio spot
is the sentimental favorite.

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,598
Hello, stranger.

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,275
I was hoping I'd see you.

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,158
You know, other than on TV.

107
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
- You don't watch.
- My mother and sister do.

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,633
Really? Do they hate me?

109
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh, just a minute.

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,313
Megan, I want you to meet Jim Cutler.

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,880
He's the president of CGC.

112
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,191
This is Megan Draper.
She's also a finalist.

113
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,794
You must be Don's wife.

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,351
When I started out,
they didn't make copywriters like you.

115
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,999
Good luck.

116
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,073
He's the head of accounts.

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,391
He's like Roger with bad breath.

118
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,200
So he knows who you are.
It must be going well.

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,919
If I survive tonight.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,390
CGC has no other finalists.

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,312
Other-They have none.

122
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
I only came because
it seemed important to Don.

123
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,193
I bet it is.
We're the only finalists from SCDP...

124
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,794
and neither of us work there anymore.

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,954
My work was for beans,
and they aren't even a client anymore.

126
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,759
I don't want to talk about this.

127
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,752
I want to talk about my apartment.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,036
I made an offer today.
I think we're gonna be neighbors.

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,720
- 84th and York.
- You're buying a place?

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
Well, I paid off my debts
and helped out my mother...

131
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,911
and it turns out I still
have this tax problem.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,595
Don't apologize, Peggy. You deserve it.

133
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,160
Thank you.

134
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,038
I should get back.

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,192
I have to walk
all the way down to the front.

136
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,399
You're terrible.

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,837
These are the worst seats in the room.

138
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,958
- Don Draper, this is Randall Walsh.
- A pleasure to meet you.

139
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,953
Randy here is in insurance and he wants to
come in for an official visit.

140
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,999
Look, man, it's not like we're not
supposed to talk about business here.

141
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,992
You want a presentation right now?

142
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,311
I don't think we'll interrupt
the proceedings, wherever they are.

143
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,916
- I just thought you two should meet.
- We've already met.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,993
In fact, I'm pretty sure we've had
this meeting already too.

145
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,676
- And it went well.
- So where's our check?

146
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,119
- He's solid.
- Okay, Randy.

147
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,271
Go get back in your cage.

148
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,915
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

149
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,709
Have no fear. They're gonna fire off
a cannon when the atrocities begin.

150
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,839
Hello all. You remember my wife Nan.

151
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,799
Hello, everyone. Good luck.

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,396
I told you, Nan,
Peggy's the only one competing.

153
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,472
Well, I didn't know what else to say.

154
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,353
So you probably figured out by now
that you didn't win.

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,430
Ted.

156
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,273
But it doesn't matter,
because next year you will.

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,591
- Ted.
- And the year after.Just a second, honey.

158
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,678
- Hey, man, sorry.
- Oh, I'm in your seat.

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,071
Nan, you wanted to see Paul Newman.
Here he is.

160
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,751
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,355
Ladies and gentlemen,
we would like to welcome you...

162
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,477
to the Advertising Club of New York's...

163
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,957
Fourth Annual ANDY Awards
for Excellence in Advertising.

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,319
So you like kids?

165
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,518
Excuse me?

166
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,239
I was asking because you're a teacher...

167
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,915
but I realize how that could sound
like something else.

168
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,032
I'm a student teacher.

169
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,157
I'm getting my master's at Hunter.

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,678
And, yes, I like kids. Some kids.

171
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,434
I just really can't believe
he brought you to the apartment.

172
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,718
Stop saying that.
You don't know where I live.

173
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,350
Well, it's kind of early
to find out, isn't it?

174
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,957
Yes, I suppose it is.

175
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,918
I don't know what you're expecting.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,912
A couple of alter kockers arrange
a little meeting like this-

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,595
It sounds very old world,
but it doesn't feel like it.

178
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,400
I mean, you're a sexy girl,
and you smell great.

179
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
You don't need to be set up.

180
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,599
And I sure as hell didn't arrange this.

181
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,911
I'm sure my father told you
what a lothario I am, but I'm not.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,198
I'm very anxious about it.
I've never had sex, not even once.

183
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,838
Okay.

184
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,991
What am I doing?
I ordered soup. I just said that.

185
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,112
Michael...

186
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,432
I'm just doing a favor for my parents.

187
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,160
Tonight will not be the night.

188
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,156
And I saw a picture of you...

189
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,072
and, honestly, you're very handsome.

190
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,356
And I'm obviously very shallow.

191
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,557
- I am?
- You must have heard that before.

192
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,635
So...

193
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,712
do you make a lot of money teaching?

194
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,436
No.

195
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,558
Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Newman.

196
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,594
Good evening. I am Paul Newman.

197
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,633
The Advertising Club of New York...

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,997
has been kind enough
to let me say a few words here tonight.

199
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,517
And I want to make one thing
clear from the very start.

200
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,034
I need binoculars.

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,592
I'm not here because I'm an actor.

202
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,797
We invited him because he's an actor.

203
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,076
I'm here because I've got six kids
and I'm worried about-

204
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,998
That's not an actor. That's a speck.

205
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,470
Gene McCarthy stood up
to Lyndon Johnson...

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,119
before Bobby Kennedy.

207
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,080
The others backed into the election
with their fingers to the wind...

208
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,958
thinking of their own career...

209
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,475
when the nation was
in critical need of a hero.

210
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,472
I know Bobby Kennedy...

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,520
but I'm supporting Gene McCarthy
for President of the United States.

212
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,311
Mr. Newman, sir!

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,756
Do you know, Mr. Newman, sir,
that Martin Luther King is dead?

214
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,071
What have you to say?

215
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,678
No, that can't be.

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,878
Who the hell said that?

217
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,672
How awful.

218
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,079
If I could have your attention
for a moment, please.

219
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,117
A moment of your attention.

220
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,237
Not wanting to interrupt the festivities...

221
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,677
we hoped to keep this news
until the end of the event.

222
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,919
As it stands, let's take 10 minutes...

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,791
to talk out this terrible event
and then resume the program.

224
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,319
What do you think happened?

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,512
- What do you think?
- Come on.

226
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,990
I guess Puerto Rico. But who has time?

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,077
Your father says you've even
written some billboards.

228
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,038
That must be exciting.

229
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,430
You'd think so,
but they usually change it so much...

230
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,399
by the time they put it up there, it just
makes you angry every time you walk by.

231
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,119
<i>... in Memphis, Tennessee...</i>

232
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,954
<i>after being shot in the face
by an unknown assailant...</i>

233
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,114
<i>on the balcony in front of
a down town hotel a short while ago.</i>

234
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,557
<i>Associate d Press says Assistant Police

235
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,472
<i>confirmed Dr. King's death.</i>

236
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,950
<i>Reverend Dr. King,

237
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,996
Oh, my God.

238
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,673
<i>- was 39 years old.</i>
- They had to do it.

239
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,831
<i>He was in Memphis
to lead demonstrations...</i>

240
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,639
<i>in sympathy with a prolonged strike...</i>

241
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,758
<i>by municipal garbage men,

242
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,832
<i>Police at last report
were still looking...</i>

243
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,151
<i>for a young white male
who was seen running...</i>

244
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,359
<i>from the scene of the shooting and
reportedly dropped the weapon in flight.</i>

245
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,478
What are you doing in here?
Thought you'd be by the set.

246
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,550
She won't let us watch.

247
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,597
Because who knows what
they're going to show.

248
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,994
You don't have to go.

249
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,912
Betty, they're gonna burn down the city.

250
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,719
Everything's fine.
I have to go help the mayor.

251
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,234
Please be careful.

252
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,795
- And call me.
<i>- We repeat...</i>

253
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,078
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,
America's non violent civil rights...</i>

254
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,476
What is taking so long?

255
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,280
There are other people here
who need to make calls.

256
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,591
They shot him in the face in Memphis.

257
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,398
Do they know who?

258
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,597
Come on, they didn't catch him yet,
but you know who.

259
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,959
Listen,Jimmy says they can get me
a photographer if I can get uptown.

260
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,838
No, it's not a good idea.

261
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,037
It's the <i>New York Times.</i>

262
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,272
- And what?
- It's a huge story.

263
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,520
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Peggy, it's too late.

264
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,796
I'm going to Harlem in a tuxedo.

265
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,438
I can't believe this.

266
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,752
Abe just went uptown for work.

267
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,150
I'm sick and I don't even know
how I'm gonna get home.

268
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,391
We'll give you a ride.

269
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,836
I'm tired of waiting for a phone.
I'm going home.

270
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,712
What are we doing?
They're really still having the awards?

271
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,280
What else are we gonna do?

272
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,156
Look, I'm sure it's hard to sleep.

273
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,277
What is that?

274
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,960
What are you doing?

275
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,350
I didn't do it. It peeled off.

276
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,830
Why are you destroying this house?

277
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,753
You can't do this.

278
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,479
I didn't do anything.

279
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,077
I don't want to talk about it now.

280
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,159
Please just go to sleep.

281
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,760
<i>... the Civil Rights Movement has been
shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

282
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,513
<i>Police have issued
an all-points bulletin-</i>

283
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,114
It's me.

284
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,556
<i>... seen running from the scene.</i>

285
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,592
How are you?

286
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,233
Not good.

287
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,630
I don't know why I'm so surprised.

288
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,996
It's shameful.

289
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,878
Listen, I-

290
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,558
I don't want you and Tammy to be alone.

291
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,712
I could come out
and sleep there tonight if you want.

292
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,635
No, I-

293
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,712
We'll be fine.

294
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,471
Well, I want to see Tammy.

295
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,517
Is she all right?

296
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,876
She doesn't know what's going on.

297
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,555
No, of course.

298
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,192
I'll see you on Saturday.

299
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,757
No, I'll just tell my parents
you couldn't get out of the city.

300
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,231
Or I'll just cancel it altogether.

301
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,075
- Trudy.
- What?

302
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,391
I don't want you to be worried.

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,790
Okay.

304
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,951
<i>In a nation wide television address...</i>

305
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,600
<i>President Johnson
expressed the nation's shock.</i>

306
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,436
Good night, Peter.

307
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,199
Good night.

308
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,511
<i>... of Dr. Martin Luther King.</i>

309
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,915
<i>I ask every citizen
to reject the blind violence...</i>

310
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,674
<i>that has struck Dr. King...</i>

311
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,436
<i>who lived by non violence.</i>

312
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,753
Pop, wake up.

313
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,957
What time is it?

314
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,793
What are you doing home so early?

315
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,112
We cut it short.
Martin Luther King got killed.

316
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,551
<i>... try and cool things down.</i>

317
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,120
<i>In Boston, according to police reports...</i>

318
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,510
<i>a large crowd of Negroes
stoned six police cruisers...</i>

319
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,877
<i>near a Negro housing project
in the Roxbury section.</i>

320
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,634
<i>And there was a clash between
police and young Negroes...</i>

321
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,229
<i>in Raleigh's main
down town streets tonight.</i>

322
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,915
<i>The latest report of trouble
comes from Washington, D. C....</i>

323
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,677
<i>where stores along a six-block area...
were broken into late this evening.</i>

324
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,797
<i>President Johnson went

325
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,554
<i>to express his shock
and personal grief at the tragedy.</i>

326
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,954
<i>... looking subdued and grim
at the thought...</i>

327
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,636
<i>of what this act could mean in a country
already taut with racial tension.</i>

328
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,077
He said he applauded
the escalation of decay.

329
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,198
So sick of that Marxist bullshit.

330
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,877
So far it's only looting in Harlem
but a lot of places are on fire.

331
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,111
Well, it's raining.

332
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,396
Do you think your secretary is okay?

333
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,112
Sylvia and Arnold are in D.C.

334
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,680
My father just hides behind his intellect.

335
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
He doesn't want to feel any emotions.

336
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,672
Let's watch inside.
Maybe we can fall asleep.

337
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,520
Am I disturbing you?

338
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,557
No. I'm not gonna judge you
if you want a drink.

339
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,518
The man knew how to talk.

340
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,035
I don't know why,
but I thought that would save him.

341
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,112
I thought it would solve the whole thing.

342
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,992
Oh, I don't know if
he just wants to hold hands...

343
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,151
but my insurance friend
from last night, he called.

344
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,072
He wants to come in at 3!00.

345
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,152
I'll have Caroline remind you
since you're on your own.

346
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,794
Could you get the door?

347
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,234
Yes, actually, I'm trying
to reach Dr. Rosen.

348
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,596
No, I'm not a patient.

349
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,639
I just know that he's in Washington and-

350
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,755
Well, I was concerned.

351
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,513
I'm his neighbor.

352
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,392
Oh, well, if you do reach him...

353
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,512
just say-

354
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,315
Actually, no message. I'll try later.

355
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,837
Oh, you're here.

356
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,037
I'm sorry.
There's no reception out there.

357
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,716
No, I just-
I didn't expect you to come in.

358
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,871
I kept calling and no one answered.

359
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,838
We went out to my aunt's in Newark.

360
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,834
- Why would you do that?
- My mother wanted to be with her sister.

361
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,153
Abe said it could have been a lot worse.

362
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,318
I'm so sorry.

363
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,192
I knew it was going to happen.

364
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,199
He knew it was going to happen.

365
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
But it's not gonna stop anything.

366
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,232
And these fools running in the streets-

367
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,676
It's exactly what he didn't want.

368
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,592
You should go home.

369
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,037
In fact, none of us should be working.

370
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,918
Thank you.

371
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,792
Is this really what happened?

372
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,633
You didn't tell me anything.

373
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,792
They got it right,
except that it was terrifying.

374
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,315
Walking into that angry, crazy crowd...

375
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,030
and Lindsay smiling like he was going
to a pancake breakfast.

376
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,676
The only lives His Honor seemed worried
about protecting were the photographers'.

377
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,075
- But it worked.
- I'll tell you what worked.

378
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,595
Cutting deals with
all the militants last year.

379
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,956
Well, I'm glad you were there.

380
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,078
Me too. And I got to go back in.

381
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,516
I want you to eat something first.

382
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,310
Clara!

383
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,757
- Have you seen Scarlett?
- Where's my girl?

384
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,072
They must all be watching TV somewhere.

385
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,392
- Not in my office.
- I barely slept last night.

386
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,870
I just thought working
might take my mind off things.

387
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,395
Good luck.
Been on the phone all morning.

388
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,073
They're worried about
last night, obviously...

389
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,396
but they're worried about tonight,
they're worried about the weekend.

390
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,199
- Who?
- The clients.

391
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,351
They won't take make-goods.
They want money back.

392
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,511
- That's disgusting.
- I don't know.

393
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,592
It's enough of this crap already.

394
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,990
All these special broadcasts preempting
the prime-time schedule.

395
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>Be witched,</i> Merv, Dean Martin.

396
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,039
You know they might
cancel the Stanley Cup?

397
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,077
How dare you.

398
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,995
This cannot be made good.
It's shameful.

399
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,072
It's a shameful, shameful day!

400
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,597
Don't you scream at me. You don't think
I'm upset about that man being shot?

401
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,592
Only because it's costing you, you pig!

402
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,239
It's costing all of us.

403
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,198
And when's it gonna stop?
No one will be happy...

404
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,471
until they turn the most beautiful city
in the world into a shit hole.

405
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,359
- Gentlemen, stop it. Stop it this minute!
- In a second, Bert.

406
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,558
Did you know we were
in the presence of a bona fide racist?

407
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,360
That's the latest thing, isn't it?
Everybody's a racist.

408
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,476
Gentlemen!

409
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,360
I urge you to shake hands
in the spirit of erasing these remarks.

410
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,797
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,759
I suppose that my comments
were inappropriate.

412
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,150
I mistook this for a workday.

413
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,311
Don't worry.
I'm sure you can make your money back...

414
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,313
on some Movie of the Week
next fall about the death of a great man.

415
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,113
That is not what I meant.

416
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,476
Let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

417
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,155
That man had a wife and four children.

418
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,238
I'm sorry I'm late. Would you like coffee?

419
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,438
Dawn, I'm just glad you're okay.
Joan was trying to reach you.

420
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,477
The phone was out
for a little bit last night...

421
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,120
and, well, it took some time to get here.

422
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,112
I don't think you should work today.

423
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,556
I couldn't reach you.
I assumed you weren't coming in.

424
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,717
My mother told me I should.

425
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,636
Well, Mr. Cooper just announced
that out of respect...

426
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,359
we're going to close the office early.

427
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,800
That's probably a good idea.

428
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,837
Mr. Sterling still wants
to have the 3!00 meeting.

429
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,400
Are we closed or not?

430
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,200
Stan and Ginsberg will also be joining.
Do you want to cancel it?

431
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,358
- If you're gonna stay, I'll stay.
- No, you go.

432
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,114
I'd really rather be here today.

433
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,714
Okay.

434
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,638
We're all so sorry.

435
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,713
Do you want anything?

436
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,594
No.

437
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,874
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

438
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,917
This is Peggy.

439
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,834
I was about to send over your offer,
and it occurred to me-

440
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,913
Oh, my offer.
I completely forgot about that.

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,435
- You haven't sent it?
- No, I haven't.

442
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,035
Well, no one's going
to want to look at that today.

443
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
May I speak?

444
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,910
I thought the same thing,
but then I realized...

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,673
there's trouble 10 blocks away.

446
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,558
They're probably on pins and needles.

447
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,553
So am I.
Do I want to live up there?

448
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,439
Get a hold of yourself.
The other buyer never came in.

449
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,751
Why don't we come in
at 5,000 under asking...

450
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,479
and give them 24 hours to respond?

451
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,478
<i>We'll let the TV news do the rest.</i>

452
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,195
- I don't know.
- This is the only apartment for you.

453
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,272
You don't want to be
kicking yourself next week.

454
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,750
And, of course, I'll wait
until tomorrow to present.

455
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,474
Good girl.

456
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,673
Randall Walsh, you remember Don.

457
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,594
This is Stan Rizzo and Michael Ginsberg.

458
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,631
Randall, would you like a drink?

459
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,878
Never. I really don't even want to talk.

460
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,953
I was trying to communicate without words,
but it's not working.

461
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,271
Randy, it never works.

462
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,910
Randall has an idea and
the ad director won't take a chance.

463
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,117
You're in the property insurance business.

464
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,954
I'll bet you're about
to get hit pretty hard.

465
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,679
Forget about that.

466
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,720
This is about a no bullshit approach
to why I got into this business.

467
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,031
People say they care.

468
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,516
I really care.

469
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,193
We're waiting for you, Randall.

470
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,911
All I see when I close my eyes...

471
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,951
is our name and a Molotov cocktail
being lit with a match.

472
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,509
And then a coupon at the bottom.

473
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,158
The ad sales guy didn't like that?

474
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,630
I know what it looks like- fearmongering.

475
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,757
But this is the opposite.

476
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,071
This is a coded message that came to me...

477
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,153
when I was visited by
the spirit of Dr. King last night.

478
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,877
He said that I should question
the whole property thing, man.

479
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,672
It makes you happy, right?

480
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,438
No, I think it was,
is and will always be in poor taste.

481
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,671
'Cause you'd rather not think about it.

482
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,994
But there is a tear, and in that tear
are all the tears in the world...

483
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,720
all the animals crying.

484
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,036
You're right.
I don't want to think about it.

485
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,273
What Don's saying is despite
what we believe to be good intentions...

486
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,511
you're allowing the emotions of the day...

487
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,798
and whatever else you got in your system,
to influence your judgment.

488
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,076
Are you forgetting what Tecumseh said?

489
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,318
Heya howa howa hoya.

490
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,076
- Heya howa howa.
- I had forgotten that.

491
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,753
We'll think about it.

492
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,637
This is an opportunity.

493
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
The heavens are telling us to change.

494
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,270
You talked to Dr. King's ghost?

495
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,238
Make sure Randy doesn't get lost.

496
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,675
- I had to wait around for that?
- I don't know.

497
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,673
He was very emotional.
He talked me off a roof once.

498
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,240
I kind of owed him. You want a drink?

499
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,874
I just want to go home.

500
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,952
Someone's gonna do that idea, you know.

501
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,713
Not us.

502
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,190
<i>Three deaths have been reported
in the Washington rioting so far.</i>

503
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,239
<i>There are no details yet
on the circumstances surrounding them.</i>

504
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,472
<i>More than 350 persons
have been treated for injuries.</i>

505
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,359
<i>Among them,
several policemen and firemen.</i>

506
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,750
<i>Firefighting was hampered
if for no other reason...</i>

507
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,036
<i>by the sheer volume of the alarms.</i>

508
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,272
<i>But still, some persons
were injured and-</i>

509
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,637
It's Betty. You're supposed
to pick up the kids!

510
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,996
Oh, shit.

511
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,590
Got it. Hello.

512
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,160
I knew you would forget.

513
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,317
You really want them down here?

514
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,552
I know you don't. You get out of
every opportunity to see them.

515
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,597
<i>You don't even know
how strange they're acting.</i>

516
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,399
The news is very upsetting.

517
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,598
I'm sure it has nothing to do with
the fact that their father forgot about them.

518
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,433
You want me to come up there
and get them...

519
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,637
drive right through everything after dark?

520
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,359
Well, of course, Henry thinks it's fine...

521
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,477
but he's not as concerned
about their safety as you are.

522
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,392
Well, Henry would know.

523
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,713
I guarantee you'd go to Canada
on your knees to pick up your girlfriend.

524
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,359
I don't believe this.

525
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,872
I'm going to get the kids.

526
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,600
<i>... relatively little interference
during the afternoon.</i>

527
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,957
Really?

528
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,918
They called in the troops in Washington...

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,913
but Henry says we're fine here.

530
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,359
She's a piece of work.

531
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,194
<i>Looting spread to the down town
shopping section of the city...</i>

532
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,239
<i>and as darkness fell, arrests increased.</i>

533
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,391
You finished with that?
You can walk me to work.

534
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,836
I'm already at work.

535
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,640
Since when are you going in on Saturday?

536
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,599
Since I don't want to be
in front of the TV set.

537
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,240
Good as new.

538
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,272
This?

539
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,272
This is a mess.

540
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,831
You can't sew.
You can't cook. You can't clean.

541
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,231
You don't think there's a reason
you have all these flaws?

542
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,437
You need a girl.

543
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,432
But maybe you don't like 'em.

544
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,239
I like girls, Dad.

545
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,040
If that was true,
you'd be in bed with her right now.

546
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,271
I don't think anybody's in the mood.

547
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,158
It's quite the opposite.

548
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,711
Now's the time when a man and a woman
need to be together the most.

549
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,280
In a catastrophe.

550
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,914
In the flood, the animals went two by two.

551
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,037
You, you're gonna get on the ark
with your father.

552
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,476
I can find my own girls, okay?

553
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,358
Okay.

554
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,717
I'll bring you a sandwich.

555
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,998
I'm glad you finally slept.

556
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,958
What's going on?

557
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,793
We're going to a vigil in the park.

558
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,555
- You're not supposed to be watching TV.
- I'm not.

559
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,712
- You are, and Mom said you can't.
- Sally, stop it.

560
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,312
Troy and Bridget called.
They're gonna meet us there.

561
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,472
- We'll be back in a couple of hours.
- I don't feel well.

562
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,869
You go on ahead. I'll watch him.

563
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,679
Come on.

564
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,718
Look, I just can't sit around
in the apartment anymore.

565
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,280
I feel like I have to do something.

566
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,556
I understand.

567
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,552
I knew you wouldn't go.

568
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,394
You want some aspirin?

569
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,270
Hey. Turn it off.

570
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,396
Tell me exactly what your mother said.

571
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,393
I'm not allowed to watch TV for a week.

572
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,033
<i>Man has no understanding.</i>

573
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,034
<i>He can be taught a few simple tricks,
nothing more.</i>

574
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,351
<i>I'm afraid I must disagree.</i>

575
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,999
<i>According to my experiments-</i>

576
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,710
<i>Dr. Zira, I must caution you.</i>

577
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,870
I guess your stomach's feeling better.

578
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,272
Why are you being punished?

579
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,158
I don't know.

580
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,993
Come on.

581
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,237
Because the wallpaper didn't line up.

582
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,633
<i>... the simian nature
from a study of man is sheer nonsense...</i>

583
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,996
<i>because man is a nuisance.</i>

584
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,154
<i>He eats up his food supplies
in the forest...</i>

585
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,312
<i>You maniacs!</i>

586
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,790
<i>You blew it up!</i>

587
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,032
<i>Oh, damn you!</i>

588
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,797
<i>Goddamn you all to hell!</i>

589
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,597
- The humans blew up New York?
- All of America.

590
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,471
- So he came back to here?
- In the future.

591
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,951
Jesus.

592
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,752
You want to see it again?

593
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,274
Can we?

594
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,994
I need another half hour.

595
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,351
Oh, yeah.Just a minute.

596
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,560
It's for you. It's the real estate agent.

597
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,836
- Hello, Ginny.
- Well, we didn't get it.

598
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,513
Wh-What happened?

599
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,193
Someone came in a little bit higher.

600
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,078
But you know what? It wasn't meant to be.

601
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,231
How much higher?

602
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,880
It was still under asking, Peggy.
It wasn't meant to be.

603
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,714
There's no other way to think about it.
Try, try again.

604
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,920
Someone else got the apartment.

605
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,559
What are you gonna do?

606
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,360
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

607
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,272
That you give a damn.

608
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,670
Peggy, this is an emotional story.

609
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,355
Stop being such a martyr.
You're having the time of your life.

610
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,274
- Why are you so mad?
- Because I'm alone in this.

611
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,874
That's not cool.

612
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,997
I don't mean financially.

613
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,675
I mean, don't you care where we live?

614
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,195
Look, I don't feel right expressing an opinion.

615
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,033
Now is your chance.

616
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,237
I don't want to live
on the Upper East Side.

617
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,471
Fine. Why?

618
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,834
I don't know.

619
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,277
I saw us raising our kids in a place
with more different kinds of people.

620
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,878
This photographer
trailing me the other night...

621
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,236
he lives in the West 80s.

622
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,119
- Isn't it dangerous?
- No, it's more run-down.

623
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,157
But that's why it's so cheap.

624
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,755
Get some lumber, a coat of paint-
People are doing it.

625
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,955
I didn't know you felt that way.

626
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,959
About the Upper East Side.

627
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,154
I do.

628
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,350
I'm sorry.

629
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,150
I just felt it wasn't my money.
How much of a say do I have?

630
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,439
You're in my life.

631
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,477
You're a part of my life.

632
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,032
Peggy, I've got to finish this.

633
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,952
- Did you see this movie?
- Not yet.

634
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,877
Do you get to see it for free?

635
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,031
- I do.
- It's really good.

636
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,079
- We're seeing it again.
- You enjoy yourself.

637
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,078
Everybody likes to go to the movies
when they're sad.

638
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,357
I was looking for you.
You left the TV on.

639
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,557
I don't feel right turning it off...

640
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,394
but I don't want to watch it.

641
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,278
He doesn't even want me to come in.

642
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,874
Everything has settled down.

643
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,633
For the time being.

644
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,918
No, I think this is the end of it.

645
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,080
Good.

646
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,716
Betty, I hope you know
you'll never have to worry about money.

647
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,156
Why would you bring that up?

648
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,993
Nothing.

649
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,879
I just keep asking myself,
"What am I doing?"

650
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,318
- About what?
- I keep thinking about walking through Harlem...

651
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,030
Lindsay a few paces ahead,
grinning like he always does...

652
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,316
the rest of us following behind.

653
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,234
- Wasn't that frightening?
- It was exhilarating.

654
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,630
But what was the cost
of avoiding that riot?

655
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,713
Police corruption,
disrespect for authority...

656
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,593
negotiating with hoodlums.

657
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,912
You can't say that to the mayor.
He's never been more popular.

658
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,515
It's just- Betty...

659
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,950
I keep thinking I would do it differently.

660
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,996
I want to do it differently.

661
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,519
And, well, they approached me
like they always do when somebody dies...

662
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,990
and they offered me a seat
in the state senate.

663
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,879
Do you want to run?

664
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,555
Run? It's a Republican seat.

665
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,075
It's basically unopposed.

666
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,994
- You'd have to quit the mayor's office.
- He'll understand.

667
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,595
You think I'm the first guy
sick of being in a flank?

668
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,957
I feel like I've been
asking you to do this since I met you.

669
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,872
Well, I finally heard you.

670
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,555
It's a stepping-stone
to state attorney general.

671
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,075
- And-
- And who knows what else?

672
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,799
Easy, partner.

673
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,917
This is what I've wanted for you.

674
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,593
Us.

675
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,911
I can't wait for people to meet you.

676
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,471
You know? Really meet you.

677
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,317
Everyone's in bed.

678
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,676
Gene finally climbed in with Sally.

679
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,471
I felt better, but now I don't.

680
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,275
- Why?
- Because who knows what you're feeling?

681
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,033
I didn't know what to say to her...

682
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,830
except, "I'd tell you to ask your father,
but he's at the movies."

683
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,116
I should have said, "He's just drunk."

684
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,510
You're better with them.

685
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,831
You don't understand.

686
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,389
I do.

687
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,915
You don't have Marx. You've got a bottle.

688
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,640
Is this what you really want to be to them
when they need you?

689
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,632
No.

690
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,038
I don't think I ever wanted
to be the man who loves children.

691
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,719
But from the moment they're born...

692
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,594
that baby comes out,
and you act proud and excited...

693
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,435
and hand out cigars.

694
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,597
But you don't feel anything.

695
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,674
Especially if you had a difficult childhood.

696
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,754
You want to love them, but you don't.

697
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,351
And the fact that you're...

698
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,276
faking that feeling...

699
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,316
makes you wonder if your own father
had the same problem.

700
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,151
Then one day they get older...

701
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,635
and you see them do something...

702
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,877
and you feel...

703
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,040
that feeling
that you were pretending to have.

704
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,593
And it feels like your heart
is going to explode.

705
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,191
That was faster than I expected.

706
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,672
Are things calmer out there?

707
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,392
Well, then...

708
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,551
have a good night.

709
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,876
Hey.

710
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,273
- You need to go to sleep.
- I can't.

711
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,312
So why can't you sleep?

712
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,159
I'm scared.

713
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,880
Don't make me sorry
for taking you to the movies.

714
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,633
No.

715
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,473
I just keep thinking...

716
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,797
what if somebody shoots Henry?

717
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,759
No one's gonna do that.

718
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,719
- But they could.
- But they won't.

719
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,997
Henry's not that important.

720
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,439
Go to sleep.
