1
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,154
I was waiting up.

2
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,552
I didn't want to wake you.

3
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,876
Don.

4
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,476
What?

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,075
I don't know what's going on...

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,119
but you have to pull back on
the throttle a little, honey.

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,913
Don, turn off the range.

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,113
Sorry, I forgot about them.

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,919
It's fine.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,477
I want to make you a real breakfast.
You look terrible.

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,714
So do you.

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,195
Just stay home today.
Can you do that for me?

13
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,918
Please try and sleep it off.

14
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,997
You want to quit in front of Kenny?
He hasn't fired a shot.

15
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,992
Whatever you fellas want.

16
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,151
Kenny, you need to
discharge that weapon...

17
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,800
before Ray turns us
into the Bataan Death March.

18
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,997
You see that tree over there?

19
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,549
Pretend it's Ralph Nader
and let's go get a drink.

20
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,756
Wait!

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,312
Oh, shit.

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,074
<i>In recent years, crime in this country...</i>

23
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,392
<i>has grown nine times
as fast as population.</i>

24
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,952
<i>At the current rate, the crimes of
violence in America will double by 1972.</i>

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,829
<i>We cannot accept that kind
of future for America.</i>

26
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,515
<i>We owe it to the decent
and law-abiding citizens ofAmerica...</i>

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,593
<i>to take the offensive
against the criminal forces...</i>

28
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,559
<i>that threaten their peace
and their security...</i>

29
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,316
<i>and to rebuild respect
for law across this country.</i>

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,433
<i>I pledge to you, the wave of crime...</i>

31
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,991
<i>is not going to be
the wave of the future in America.</i>

32
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,432
<i>I suppose I'm supposed to believe
that you didn't know that she wasn't me...</i>

33
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,160
<i>when you took her to the boathouse
and you had your way.</i>

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,838
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

35
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,400
<i>Don't you dare ignore me.</i>

36
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,632
<i>A lot of people laugh
at the idea of a girl playing the tuba.</i>

37
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,878
- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i>

38
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,599
Your girl said you were home.

39
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,637
I am.

40
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,552
If you're too sick to talk, it can wait.

41
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,960
I can talk.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,679
It concerns Sally.

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
What about her?

44
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,557
She's not coming this weekend either.

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,032
Oh. That's too bad.

46
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,952
Although you should tell her
if she does come...

47
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,157
I'm gonna be working all weekend.

48
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,357
Why would I tell her that?

49
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,797
It could have been
being held hostage by that burglar...

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,190
or the fight she had
with her friend after Model UN...

51
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,999
but she says she's not going again.

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,552
What do you want me to do about it?

53
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,756
I don't know that
it's a good thing or a bad thing...

54
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,230
but she wants to go away
to a boarding school.

55
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,516
I'll pay for all of it.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,353
She has to get in, of course.

57
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,272
How much does that cost?

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,115
Eleanor, Henry's daughter, went there
and I think she'll interview well.

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,635
She has good manners with everyone but me.

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,234
<i>She'll get in.</i>

61
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,120
I don't know, Don. It is Miss Porter's.

62
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,998
Jackie Kennedy went there.

63
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,393
You mean Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

64
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,920
What kind of medicine
are you taking for this cold?

65
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,354
Formula 44.

66
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,954
Yeah, I bet.

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,598
Jackie did well twice.

68
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,080
So did you.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,599
- I'm going to go.
<i>- Betts...</i>

70
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,872
will you tell her that Megan-

71
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,238
That we both miss her?

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Of course.

73
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,831
Cranberry, Cran-Apple...

74
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,832
Grape-Berry, that would be Cranprune.

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,389
Don't let the name fool you.

76
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,312
They're all delicious, my friend.

77
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,959
Is that the line?

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,956
They are one dried
and one fresh fruit for a new generation.

79
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,476
You want to use Vaughn Meader?
I thought they buried that guy with JFK.

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,120
No, there was this old salt
who took us around the plant.

81
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,556
He had a heavy accent and a red shirt.

82
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,871
Ted called him Rose Kennedy.

83
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,115
During all this levity, did you mention that
Cranprune sounds like a glass of diarrhea?

84
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,319
When we agreed to take the blends,
we agreed to take the names.

85
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,876
It's got less pucker than the Cranberry,
but it's heavier than the Cran-Apple.

86
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,759
That means Cran-Apple is light.

87
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,035
Light.

88
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,680
- And Cranberry is-
- Sour?

89
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,195
- Bitter?
- Makes your teeth feel weird?

90
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,717
It's tart. That's all they keep
saying about the berries.

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,757
Yes, they do.

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,878
You know, I hate to say this again,
but I got to take a leak.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,832
Great idea. Peggy.

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,717
You want to get some chowdah?

95
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,473
Thought you had to pee.

96
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,952
No, I just wanted to see if I could get him
to respond to an idea that wasn't hers.

97
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,154
You look better.

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,235
Hello?

99
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,719
I can barely hear you.

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,078
Oh, hello, Harry.

101
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,196
What?

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,112
Listen, I wouldn't bother you at home.

103
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,431
Obviously I'm on the Coast,
but I've got good news.

104
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,876
You finally found a hooker who will take
traveler's checks?

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,236
Why did I tell you that?

106
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,597
I got a packet at the desk
and then a phone call from Sunkist.

107
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,716
I told you to drop that.

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,280
Well, Jeffrey, the fat one...

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,632
he finally got a look at the media plan
and suddenly they're interested in TV.

110
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,076
They've called a meeting
with Sanford, who I think is a decider.

111
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,680
Don't do that.

112
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,233
Don, they're talking about two and a half
times the print budget.

113
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,634
We can't.

114
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,315
- Why not?
- Because we have a conflict.

115
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,312
<i>Ted has Ocean Spray.</i>

116
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,357
You should have told them we withdrew.

117
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,159
Adiós, Harry.

118
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,070
I really didn't want you to work today.

119
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,913
Harry is such a pain in the ass.

120
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,233
Let's get out of here.

121
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,560
That was really, really scary.

122
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,792
It was disturbing.

123
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,795
Hello.

124
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,599
Oh, hello.

125
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,438
That was quite a film.

126
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,637
It was terrifying, wasn't it?

127
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,238
Well, we were, um-

128
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,518
You know we're doing
the St. Joseph's spot based on it...

129
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,038
and Peggy and I had an argument about
whether there was a Japanese in the end.

130
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,919
You know, when Mia Farrow
walks in and sees the baby...

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,480
and the devil worshippers are there.

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,040
There was.

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,520
I know.

134
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,591
So you'd both already seen it?

135
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,356
Yeah. But obviously
she remembered it better.

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,238
She wants a Japanese in the ad.

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,152
They always have a camera.

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,071
We're going to grab a bite.
Have you eaten?

139
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,672
I should get going. I have a date.

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,997
Yes, well, don't let us keep you.

141
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,231
So, Don, I see you're feeling better.

142
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,277
I had to get him out of the house.

143
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,999
We can still go eat.

144
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,391
I am supposed to throw around a football.
I should go.

145
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,880
After you.

146
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,633
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,634
I would never live
in an apartment that old.

148
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,236
There's so many buildings
like that in Montreal. It's creepy.

149
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,915
Don?

150
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,549
What? I'm gonna have nightmares.

151
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,957
You know who's not gonna sleep?

152
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,759
Why are you so interested in this?

153
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,274
You're not interested?

154
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,919
Honestly, I'm more troubled by the idea...

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,038
of using <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>
for a children's aspirin ad.

156
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,715
Why were they going to the movies at 5:00?

157
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,712
They didn't think anybody would be there.

158
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,439
You've been on a soap too long.

159
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,910
I don't know. I guess.

160
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,554
What time is it in California?

161
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,757
Three hours earlier.

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,592
I need to make a phone call.

163
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay.

164
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,079
What happened?

165
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,435
Come in.

166
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,113
What the hell happened?

167
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,272
I'm fine.
Well, obviously not.

168
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,874
I thought you were in Detroit.

169
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,189
I was.

170
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,958
I told them that Cynthia was pregnant...

171
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,838
and they took me out to celebrate
and they shot me.

172
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,071
- What?
- It's not funny.

173
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,513
Chevy is killing me.

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,557
I hate Detroit.

175
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,792
I hate cars. I hate guns.

176
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,031
I don't even want
to look at a steak anymore.

177
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,795
The only way to get through this is to keep
reminding yourself it's a great account.

178
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,830
I'm gonna be a father.
I'm gonna have a family.

179
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,755
Pull yourself together. Anyone here would
trade places with you in a second.

180
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,356
Did I tell you that on the way to
the hospital, they tried to stop for lunch?

181
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,272
They're fat yahoos in cheap suits.
I'm done.

182
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,559
Are you entertaining this idea?

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,678
You'll be laughed out of this building
and then out of advertising in general.

184
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,991
It'd be a difficult transition.

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,232
Chevy won't like it, but I think they're
feeling pretty guilty right now.

186
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,960
Well, if it's in your power...

187
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,311
and you're willing to give up
what goes with it...

188
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,033
I would gladly take your place.

189
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,399
What about your family?

190
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,154
Trudy and I are separated.

191
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,551
I only see Tammy every other weekend.
She won't know the difference.

192
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,714
I'm sorry to hear that.

193
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,511
Yes, it's unfortunate.

194
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,199
I don't know what to say.

195
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,552
Say you'll back me up
and I'll be there for you.

196
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,959
Congratulations on the baby.

197
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,355
Thank you.

198
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,794
Is he ready?

199
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,073
- Morning.
- Morning.

200
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,560
- Morning.
- Hello.

201
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,399
We have what we think is some
pretty spectacular news.

202
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,193
Crane called from Los Angeles.

203
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,033
Sunkist finally looked
at the media plan...

204
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,555
and enthusiastically
embraced a television campaign...

205
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,553
to the tune of eight million dollars.

206
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,431
Great Caesar's ghost.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,515
They don't care that we're
a month into Ocean Spray?

208
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,592
Harry said we'd resign.

209
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,479
Apparently they were
excited by the spike in color TVs.

210
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,791
Don told them that was the secret- color.

211
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,078
- When did you tell them that?
- When we were out there.

212
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,117
But they wouldn't leave Harry alone.

213
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,316
You upset, Ted?
It's almost three times the business.

214
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,357
No, I just-

215
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,152
Well, I'm dreading making the call.

216
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,913
Well, I'll call Ocean Spray.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,753
And the rest of our clients?

218
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,514
Someone has to let them know to look out
for a knife in their back.

219
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
You want to turn it down?

220
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,470
Absolutely not. Don't be an idiot, Ted.

221
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,199
Stay out of this, Jim.

222
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,837
Forget about giving someone your word,
which obviously doesn't mean anything to you.

223
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,839
How does it look?

224
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,435
The right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is doing.

225
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,355
You're right.

226
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,120
We should work more together.
We have to. That's the message from this.

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,592
Then it's agreed that we have a more
coherent approach to new business.

228
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,717
That means no more surprises, Don.

229
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,790
You're right. I apologize.

230
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,551
But it's a great account.

231
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,313
Can we celebrate now?

232
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,596
I think Peggy should be on it.

233
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,637
She has, you know, juice experience now.

234
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,712
That makes sense.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,514
What are you doing?

236
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,796
Getting ready to do a little hunting.

237
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,032
What's going on?
Mr. Cooper wants to see you.

238
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,194
Let's find out.

239
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,678
That's a.22. It's not good for anything
but squirrels, you know.

240
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,750
Would you ever leave New York,
Annie Oakley?

241
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,190
Hello, Pete.

242
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,634
Hello, Bob.

243
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,518
Kenny, how are you feeling?

244
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,389
Better than I am right now.
Have a seat.

245
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,237
Well, shiver me timbers.

246
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,190
I'd laugh, but it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

247
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,513
For obvious reasons,
Ken is withdrawing from handling Chevy.

248
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,478
You sure you want to do this?

249
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,880
I'm positive.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,870
Kenny, you know,
I once had a client cup my wife's breast.

251
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,714
Lee Garner, Jr. made me hold his balls.

252
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,954
Well, I'm not resigning Chevy.

253
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,999
I just can't be
on the ground there anymore.

254
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,799
Pete and I have already discussed it...

255
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,712
and I will stay on the business
in New York.

256
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,950
They'll want that.

257
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,077
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't reluctant.

258
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,550
But I know Ken would do the same for me.

259
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,678
Crocodile tears. How quaint.

260
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,479
Look, I know everyone's worried...

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,631
but Bob's going to be a big
help with the transition.

262
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,040
Anything I can do.

263
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,797
In all deference to the weeks Bob
spent trying to develop ties with Chevy...

264
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,111
I think it's best
if I bring in my own team.

265
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,475
That's a dumb idea.

266
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,600
Any continuity preserves the belief
that service has not changed.

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,356
It's nothing about Bob in particular...

268
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,798
but isn't it better to create the belief
that service has improved?

269
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,637
Pete, you're going to need to know
where the land mines are buried.

270
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,393
I'd listen to the cyclops, Pete.

271
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,911
I think maybe I'm keeping you
from discussing this freely.

272
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,953
I understand Pete's objections,
but I will do whatever is decided.

273
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,117
Pete, there's nothing to discuss.
I like Bob, Chevy likes Bob.

274
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,035
And if you don't like Bob,
we can find someone who does.

275
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,115
Of course.

276
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,155
By the way, thank you,
all of you, for having this trust in me.

277
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,640
Is there a problem?

278
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,279
I don't want to work with you.

279
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,352
I don't want to stay in a hotel with you.
You're sick.

280
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,352
Why would you say that?

281
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,395
So you didn't profess your love to me?

282
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,030
Only my admiration,
which is waning quickly.

283
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,033
This is not about my own interests.
I care about Chevy.

284
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,311
You should watch what you say to people.

285
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,074
Is that right?

286
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,075
Congratulations.
Can you believe this guy?

287
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,433
So?

288
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,153
So what?

289
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,000
Can I have one?

290
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,912
Are you anxious?

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,390
I expect you to sail
through this interview.

292
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,949
Geez, I wasn't nervous
about it a minute ago.

293
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,640
I hope it doesn't ruin it
that I'm excited for you.

294
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,912
When I was in 10th grade,
my friend Annie left-

295
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,595
To go to Rosemary Hall.
I know, you told me.

296
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,233
Did I tell you she hated her mother?

297
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,950
Good for her.

298
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,070
Is it about getting away from boys?

299
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,077
If I say yes, will you stop asking?

300
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,437
I'm proposing some reasons
because you aren't being very forthcoming.

301
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,312
Sally, I can turn this car around.

302
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,389
I want to be a grown-up,
but I know how important my education is.

303
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,273
Oh.

304
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,519
Well, congratulations.

305
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,069
You log a few months on that,
you can work anywhere.

306
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,879
I'm not looking anymore.

307
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,237
So what is this? That old joke-
"Hell, I'm telling everyone"?

308
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,631
No, I'm calling on behalf
of a young account man...

309
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,679
whom we love, but can't promote
because Draper doesn't like him.

310
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,956
So you're looking for an account man?

311
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,633
You know you can't work here.

312
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,354
I'll be frank.

313
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,519
I got to get this kid out of here,
and he's not going to call you himself.

314
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,877
I'd love to present some concrete options
to him when I push him out the door.

315
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,316
I just need leads.
He doesn't have to land anything.

316
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,835
He must be pretty good
if he's in your way.

317
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,353
He's eager to please.

318
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,274
Handsome. His name is Bob Benson.

319
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,273
He has a blue blood connection
to Brown Brothers Harriman.

320
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,194
Beloit, Wharton.
I'll send over his personnel file.

321
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,160
And I'll send over a bill.
Make it an even grand. Cash.

322
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,990
No, no, no, no.

323
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,199
- What's going on in there?
- Someone's having a good time.

324
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,840
You do realize this is the best picture
these people will ever take?

325
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,719
We were thinking about putting this
old man in a wig...

326
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,871
because he looks so much like Ruth Gordon.

327
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,440
- Fill me in.
- That's a great idea.

328
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,274
The conceit is that it's shot
from the baby's point of view.

329
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,073
No, no, let's do the ad for him.

330
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,799
Joan, come here.

331
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,473
Can I do it from here?

332
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,994
No.

333
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,754
So, Don, you are the camera and the baby.

334
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,878
We might have the end of the bassinet
right at the front of the frame.

335
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,151
Maybe see some kicking
toes under a blanket.

336
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,913
Should I get down a little lower?

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,480
No, that's fine.

338
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,113
Okay, it's dark.

339
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,112
Fish-eye lens, you're the baby.

340
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,238
Just, "Whaa! Whaa!" You do that.

341
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,030
Whaa! Whaa! Whaa!

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,396
So there's a crowd. Eight or nine people.

343
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,319
It's the whole coven.
And there's a crazy little old lady.

344
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
What you need is a mustard plaster.

345
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,719
And then there's this wrinkled old man.

346
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,031
You need a compress.

347
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,713
And then a Jewish neighbor lady.

348
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,757
How about a bowl of chicken soup?

349
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,957
Anyway, there's one more of those, maybe.

350
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,350
Then they all start crowding in on you.

351
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,719
And the Japanese takes a picture
and the flash turns it white.

352
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,998
Then you see the beautiful,
radiant young mother.

353
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,312
You don't need anyone's
help but St. Joseph's.

354
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,040
Usually with things like this,
it depends on you knowing the movie.

355
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,159
But I think this works on its own.

356
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,754
I told you it was good.

357
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,990
That's a lot of people.

358
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,958
You need to feel the conspiracy.

359
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,239
You want me to come to casting?

360
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
Sure, but I'm just gonna watch.
It was all her.

361
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,638
Casting's on the West Side. You should go.

362
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,314
That's a lot of people.

363
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,350
I didn't want to dampen the enthusiasm,
but the approved budget is $15,000.

364
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,400
There's at least
$35,000 in residuals alone here.

365
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,518
- What does St. Joseph's say?
- They haven't seen the new budget.

366
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,069
So who's paying for casting?

367
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,594
We are.

368
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,320
But Ted seems confident
they'll be good for it.

369
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,471
So he wants to spring it on them
at the pre-pro meeting...

370
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,313
after we're 10 grand out of pocket?

371
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,156
I don't know, Don.
I don't tell him what to do.

372
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,916
And Diplomacy Club. I don't know
if she told you in the interview...

373
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,475
but Henry thinks she can
be an ambassador one day.

374
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,200
It's heartwarming to see
such a proud mother.

375
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,840
Well, Sally going away
is going to be difficult...

376
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,435
but, of course,
I wanted it for myself way back when.

377
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,433
And in this day and age,
it's overwhelming to raise a young girl...

378
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,000
let alone be one.

379
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,639
Beautifully put.

380
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,634
Now, Sally, during your overnight
and tomorrow in class...

381
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,918
I want you to keep in mind,
and I'm sure your mother would agree...

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,640
this is as much for you
to find out about us...

383
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,872
as it is for us to find out about you.

384
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,793
Carla, could you fetch
Millicent Turner from study hall?

385
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,314
You have fun.

386
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,438
- I'll be back in the morning around-
- 2:30 would be perfect.

387
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,759
Thank you again.

388
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,595
<i>Mr. Campbell,
your mother is here to see you.</i>

389
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,753
What are you doing here, Mother?

390
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,513
Josephine, you have my phone number.

391
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,239
This doesn't concern her.

392
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,431
I'm here for my passport.

393
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,560
I'm planning a voyage.
And I spoke to Manolo.

394
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,154
I forbade you to see him.

395
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,280
Well, he's very upset about the way
you're treating his friend Bob Benson.

396
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,397
That Spanish fly.

397
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,153
Why are you still in contact with him?

398
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,709
- I ran into him.
- Where?

399
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,598
I don't remember.

400
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:36,119
Tell Manolo that I almost threw you down
the steps when you brought up his friend.

401
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,954
Peter, I am still your mother.

402
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,120
I don't have your passport.

403
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,113
I'm sure it's expired like
everything else you own. Josephine!

404
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,953
You're endangering your position.

405
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,558
So this used to be the living room.

406
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,155
And, of course, you have to walk through
my room to get to her room...

407
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,397
but we switch over at Christmas.

408
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,676
I'd rather have my own room too.

409
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,240
Oh, hello.

410
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,833
You must be Sally.

411
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,479
I'm Mandy. Move over.

412
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,360
Sally's family lives in Rye and Manhattan.

413
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,830
Let me guess,
dad's remarried, mom's fat and sad.

414
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,839
No, they're both remarried,
but my dad's wife is my age.

415
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,150
Well, I'd like to feel sorry for you,
but things are about to get worse.

416
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,834
Hmm. Don't you like it here?

417
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,877
You're not allowed to talk anymore.

418
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,112
Our opinion is crucial to your acceptance.

419
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,194
And I can't believe no one told you
that you were supposed to look after us.

420
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,200
You didn't bring a bottle
or some cigarettes at least?

421
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,799
I probably have some money.

422
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,712
You think we need money?

423
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,237
You should call your mother.
Tell her that you're useless.

424
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,119
I can get you anything you want.

425
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,793
She keeps talking.

426
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,315
Now what do we want?

427
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,034
How was casting?

428
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,477
It was interrupted
by a phone call from St. Joseph's.

429
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,074
Did you send over a budget?

430
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,959
Yes, but relax. I talked to them.

431
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,599
I played the bad guy. They'll be fine.

432
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,672
No, they won't be.

433
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,753
They called me at casting to stop it.

434
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,832
Now I have to turn a no into a yes.

435
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,673
You were gonna have to do that anyway.

436
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,229
I couldn't even tell Peggy.

437
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,357
Did you tell her how expensive it was?

438
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,274
It's great work and you know it.

439
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,920
St. Joseph's has been doing
the same ad for 20 years.

440
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,832
They're bread and butter.
Why did you pick them to push?

441
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,072
They kept asking me
for their "plop plop fizz fizz."

442
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,470
And all of a sudden
she comes up with this.

443
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,075
She can smell the CLIO, Don.

444
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,277
Remember your first big ad?

445
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,919
She has her heart set on it.

446
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,599
It's okay, Ted. I get it.

447
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,913
You're right. They're coming in tomorrow.
Just back me up on this?

448
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,320
Of course.

449
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,437
I've got to go over that budget.

450
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,439
Yeah, she stayed skinny, but her breath
smelled like vomit all the time.

451
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,158
I think it's time
for you girls to go to bed.

452
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,434
You hemmed your skirt.

453
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,197
My friend Sandy used a stapler.

454
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,239
Then by the time she went home,
her legs were all scratched.

455
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,279
Stand still. Sally, you there?

456
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,754
Hello.

457
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,194
That was pretty fast.

458
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,396
Hey.

459
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,075
I'm Mandy and this is Millicent.

460
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,072
Hold on, do you have a rope for him?

461
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,674
Millicent, go get him.

462
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,479
Go around the front.

463
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,875
Nice digs. I'm Glen, by the way.

464
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,792
Did you have trouble finding us?

465
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,039
Rolo's driven by before.

466
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,918
Then I just looked for Snoopy.

467
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,719
Do you want a cigarette?

468
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,520
No, but I wouldn't mind a drink.

469
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,956
Rolo brought something to smoke.

470
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,830
How you been? How are your folks?

471
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,718
Can we drink it straight?

472
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,031
I know how to make a Tom Collins.

473
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,999
- She's too much.
- She's okay.

474
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,918
I don't think anyone saw us,
but we should keep it quiet.

475
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,038
I'm Rolo, by the way. Nice digs.

476
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,473
What about the proctor?

477
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,597
The housemother's a booze fiend.

478
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,672
I'll save some for her.

479
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,150
I want to get stoned.

480
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,720
I need a surface.

481
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,919
Here's looking up your old address.

482
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,229
Hello?

483
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,392
Look at the two of us,
burning the midnight oil.

484
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,756
Something wrong?
Did the messenger find you okay?

485
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,390
I'm gonna need more than this kid
Bob Benson's personnel record.

486
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,517
Might as well be written in steam.

487
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,478
What do you mean?

488
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,153
I don't even know if the name is real.

489
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,800
I don't know where he went to college,
but it wasn't Beloit.

490
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,473
I tried a buddy at Wharton...

491
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,392
he said maybe he's just
telling people Wharton...

492
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,836
so he's gonna check the whole
University of Pennsylvania.

493
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,992
But it's tough when I don't know
if he's really 28 years old.

494
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,357
The most interesting
is the Brown Brothers Harriman job.

495
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,994
You told me that.

496
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,639
I got that from him.

497
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,030
Well, I have a friend there.

498
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,351
Turns out they all remember Bobby.

499
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,272
He's from West Virginia.

500
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,353
Parents are brother
and sister or something.

501
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,275
He was a manservant for three years
to a senior vice president.

502
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,757
He took him to Europe
on the <i>Queen Elizabeth.</i>

503
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,069
Are you kidding me?

504
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,640
He had three references...

505
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,679
two nonworking numbers
at K&E and a live one at Cunningham.

506
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,678
They said he just disappeared one day...

507
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,360
with an electric pencil sharpener
and the Christmas card list.

508
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,033
So what does that mean?

509
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,874
Mostly that his only job opportunity...

510
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,952
was someplace dumb enough
not to ask any questions...

511
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,077
and so far, that's just you guys.

512
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,754
I'd offer to return the money, but I would
file this under valuable information.

513
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,798
Yes, of course.

514
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,791
I've never seen anything like this before.

515
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,954
I have.

516
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,759
<i>He's a heart patient.
He hardly ever gets out of that apartment.</i>

517
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,231
<i>Well, we call that
a DR number these days.</i>

518
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,754
<i>A DR number.</i>

519
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,672
You can do that in bed, you know.

520
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,275
<i>That's right. The Detective
division is on the third floor.</i>

521
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,120
<i>On, no, sir. All divisions- Homicide,
Robbery, Burglary. Oh, what's that?</i>

522
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,032
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

523
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,240
Since seventh grade.

524
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,789
The Ro is from Ronnie
and the Lo is from Lowell.

525
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,394
So they just started calling me Rolo.

526
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,034
And 'cause he rolls a lot of joints.

527
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,519
Should I roll another?

528
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,513
Your friend bogarted the last one
and she didn't get any.

529
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,114
I'm really drunk.

530
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,720
You think Millicent's okay?

531
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,359
She always freaks out.

532
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,750
What if she runs
screaming down the hallway...

533
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,116
and she thinks her hair is on fire
and she's screaming...

534
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
"Boy on the floor! Boy on the floor"?

535
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,312
Do you two know each other?

536
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,400
I think so, but who knows?
I was reincarnated.

537
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,756
I came back as a fish.

538
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,112
You should read my diary.

539
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,395
Come on.

540
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,554
Nice shot.

541
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,872
I've got good hands.

542
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,312
Do you play basketball?

543
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,039
I've been with lots of girls.
I know what I'm doing.

544
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,400
What kind of music do you like?

545
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,796
I don't want to talk anymore.

546
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,273
What's going on, Sally? You called us.

547
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,198
You made us drive all the way over here.

548
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,438
Suddenly you don't want to fool around?
Are you frigid?

549
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
Glen. Glen, come out.

550
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,113
Hey, come on. You've got to relax.

551
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,159
What do you want?

552
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,833
He won't leave me alone.

553
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,078
What the hell, Rolo?
I told you she's like my sister.

554
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,753
I think you're full of shit, man.

555
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,837
You just wanted the good one.

556
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,354
What is going on?

557
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,193
He tried to force me.

558
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,556
What? Damn it, Rolo.

559
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,273
She's a lying little tease.

560
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,272
That's bullshit.

561
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,674
Keep it down.

562
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,440
Get off me, Bishop.

563
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,638
Are you suicidal? I'm your ride home.

564
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,394
He'll be fine. I got to go.
I don't want to hitch.

565
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,039
Are you all right?

566
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,839
Nice meeting you.

567
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,513
You too.

568
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,434
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,153
Keep in touch.

570
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,874
How do you know him?

571
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,758
We grew up together.

572
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,355
You like trouble, don't you?

573
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,829
Good morning.

574
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,074
Are you joining us?

575
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,712
Ted wanted more firepower.

576
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,433
I thought I'd pitch in.

577
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,273
I don't understand what happened.

578
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,876
Residuals.
Can't let them sneak up on you.

579
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,111
It'll be fine.

580
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,919
We always win this one.

581
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,039
Well, I see everything's in order,
including our cookies from Ferrara's.

582
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,794
Byron, you remember Peggy Olson.

583
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,031
- Mr. Poole, nice to see you again.
- Byron.

584
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,874
And Don Draper, of course,
our other creative director.

585
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,556
Yes, and I'm sorry about the phone call,
but, well, it was a bit of a surprise.

586
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,793
But you're here and we are going
to set you at ease.

587
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,873
Now Ted and Peggy will take you through
the creative process...

588
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,151
that resulted in this ingenious spot.

589
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,120
I know what it is. I bought it the day
I heard it. I just paid a lot less for it.

590
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,556
Well, as a concept becomes more
developed, expenses can mount.

591
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,632
We want to do this right.

592
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,270
The cost is still a fraction of the business
we believe it will generate.

593
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,596
Ted, with all due respect,
it's not your job to promise sales.

594
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,275
It's your job to deliver work
for the budget agreed to.

595
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,357
It turned out to be
more people than we thought.

596
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,159
That's why we sent the budget over.

597
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,636
We didn't want there to be any surprises.

598
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,837
But this is worth the money.

599
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,673
But this is a surprise.

600
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,911
We agreed to 15,000 and it's 50.

601
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,279
You said specifically that you
wanted something contemporary...

602
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,033
with a sense of humor...

603
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,558
something that wouldn't
make young parents feel like old people.

604
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,836
This does that and more.

605
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,600
That's not a reason.

606
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,518
Well, it should be.

607
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,434
We have enough of a history
that you should trust my judgment.

608
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,878
No, I want a reason. I'm entitled.

609
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,600
You know the raft of shit I caught
when this budget came in?

610
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,395
Mr. Plough called me.

611
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,678
Uh, I hate to interrupt.

612
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,033
I think, Byron,
I know what you want to hear.

613
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,712
And it has nothing to do
with the shooting days or the cast...

614
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,636
because you've had a long and fruitful,
creative relationship together.

615
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,076
I think, and correct me if I'm wrong...

616
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,277
that when you say you want a reason...

617
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,239
you want to know why
we would push you like this.

618
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,834
It would help.

619
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,997
Well, the truth is that
I don't think Ted wants to say.

620
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,676
'Cause it's, well...

621
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,833
it's a little bit personal.

622
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,511
In fact, it's very personal.

623
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,797
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

624
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,837
Yes, you do.

625
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,640
Are you okay, Ted?

626
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,150
I, uh-

627
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,277
It's okay.

628
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,716
Tell him, Ted.

629
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,712
You don't want to say anything?

630
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,876
All right. I'll tell him.

631
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,553
It's hard for Ted to say...

632
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,717
but this was Frank Gleason's last idea.

633
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,550
Really?

634
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,398
Yes.

635
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm afraid we've gotten
a little sentimental.

636
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,072
Damn. You should have told me that.

637
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,354
I guess I was- I don't know.
I, uh-

638
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,871
The factor didn't seem
relevant except to us. I, um...

639
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,872
didn't want to lean on that.

640
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,750
Frank was a hell of a guy.
Best I can do is 25.

641
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,355
I don't care if you make
these characters out of cardboard...

642
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,750
or turn them into cartoons,
you got to reduce the cast.

643
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,513
That's all you get.

644
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,000
I understand.

645
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,599
I'll show you out.

646
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,195
You should come to
Piping Rock this Sunday.

647
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,317
Get in a few holes
before all the grass dies.

648
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,278
We'll see.

649
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,272
Was that really necessary?

650
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,960
Leave us alone.

651
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,357
What was that?

652
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,477
That was the best I could do.

653
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,513
Do you want me to tell him the truth?

654
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,114
What are you talking about?

655
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,998
You're not thinking with your head.

656
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,437
That was your solution?
Try and embarrass me?

657
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,352
You're embarrassing yourself.

658
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,079
I know your little girl
has beautiful eyes...

659
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,799
but that doesn't mean
you give her everything.

660
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,599
That has nothing to do with it.

661
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,913
Come on, we've all been there.
I mean, not with Peggy, but-

662
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,753
Don't say that about her.

663
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,230
Ted, you're kidding yourself.

664
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,154
Everybody sees it.
Just ask your secretary.

665
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,399
Your judgment is impaired.

666
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,993
You're not thinking with your head.

667
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,037
Good morning, Bob.

668
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,919
How you doing, boss?

669
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,390
I thought for certain
you would have brought me a coffee today.

670
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,158
You want me to go get one?

671
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,233
I've always wondered how
you were so expertly servile.

672
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,591
But now I know.
It used to be your profession.

673
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,273
What do you want?

674
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,716
Well, for one thing,
I wanted you to stop smiling.

675
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,074
You got it.

676
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,756
I've been awake all night wondering
what you do when you're found out.

677
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,399
This must have happened before.

678
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,039
I don't know what you're talking about.

679
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,396
- Who hired you?
- You did.

680
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,391
When?

681
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,191
I met with Ken. You walked in,
complimented my tie and walked out.

682
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,272
It was the best day of my life.

683
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,353
Well, your fraud is irrefutable.

684
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,593
Can I have a day's head start?

685
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,196
Can you give me that
at least after all I've done for you?

686
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,720
You've done more for me
than I've done for you.

687
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,473
Spectacular.

688
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,917
You don't respond well to gratitude.

689
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,351
So you're just going to run?
I don't believe you.

690
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,830
It terrifies me
what you could do in a day.

691
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,032
No, Bob, you're going
to get the benefit of the fact...

692
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,600
that I've been here before.

693
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,111
I don't know how people like you do it.

694
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,272
You're certainly better at it
than I am at whatever I do.

695
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,594
But I would like to think that I have learned
not to tangle with your kind of animal.

696
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,120
I don't understand.

697
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,471
Where you are and who you are
is not my concern.

698
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,080
I surrender.

699
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,159
So what does that mean to me?

700
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,157
I want you to graciously
accept my apologies.

701
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,595
Work alongside me, but not too closely.

702
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,313
Again, I don't understand.

703
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,754
Yes, you do.

704
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,031
I'm off-limits.

705
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,519
And please, can you find a way to get
your friend out of my mother's life?

706
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,920
You know she's demented.

707
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,957
Manolo doesn't like women.

708
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,314
Make sure.

709
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,434
Sally.

710
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,960
What?

711
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,800
So you got what you wanted
and now you think you can be rude.

712
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,709
Fine.

713
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,475
I'm not going to tell you
what Mrs. Beresford said to me...

714
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,040
when you were saying good-bye.

715
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,236
She talked to you?

716
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,430
She said you were curious and bright...

717
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,240
and received glowing reports
from all concerned.

718
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,073
But?

719
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,916
She said a girl like you coming from this
family will have plenty of choices...

720
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,912
and she hopes you choose them.

721
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,275
Oh.

722
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,555
Now get me a cigarette
and give me some details.

723
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,720
You want one, don't you?

724
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,116
Go ahead.

725
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,760
I'd rather have you do it in front of me
than behind my back.

726
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,837
I'm sure your father has given you a beer.

727
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,280
My father has never given me anything.

728
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,431
Did you tell him that I need to see him?

729
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,000
He went home.

730
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,355
When?

731
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,477
Right after I told him
you needed to see him.

732
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,157
I know what you did,
I just don't know why you did it.

733
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,594
Calm down.

734
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,991
You want to offer me a drink?
Pretend like you're helping a little more?

735
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,274
Close the door.

736
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,033
Oh, of course. You deserve privacy.

737
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,999
Look, there's still enough money
for the ad. We'll make it work.

738
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,151
Stop hiding behind the ad.

739
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,959
I know what you did.

740
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,118
I saved both of you.
How do you think it looks?

741
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,034
You hate that he is a good man.

742
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,839
He's not that virtuous.

743
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,919
He's just in love with you.

744
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,356
Well, you killed him.

745
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,079
You killed the ad.

746
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,312
You killed everything. You can stop now.

747
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,154
I'm just looking out for the agency.

748
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,513
You're a monster.
