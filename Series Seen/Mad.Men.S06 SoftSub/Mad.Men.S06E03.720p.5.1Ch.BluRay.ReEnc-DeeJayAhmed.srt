1
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,833
Here we go.

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,232
The one with the fur.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,154
You know, I might just take you up
on those theater tickets.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,960
- You must see <i>Hair.</i>
- Oh, you like that?

5
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,760
- Who doesn't?
- What is it?

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,672
Oh, it's just filled with profanity...

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,594
marijuana smoking,
and simulated sexual acts.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,319
Simulated?

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,232
And a few songs.

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,200
The two holiday chairmanships that remain
are the Fourth of July block party...

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,272
which really consists of
calling the fire department...

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,434
or the Labor Day Soap Box Derby,
which consists of calling the hospital.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,514
Which one do you do?

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,559
Our family has claimed
the Easter egg hunt.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,956
Do you dress as a bunny?

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,679
Maybe a little cottontail?

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,918
It's very wholesome.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,514
Mmm.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,910
I'd like to surprise Doug
for his birthday.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,152
Maybe you could get me
the tickets in secret.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,472
Arrangements could be made.
Just pick a date and ring me up.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,437
I have to warn you,
I'm from a small town...

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,196
and all of my forays into Manhattan
have been a disaster.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,634
We'll make a deal.

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,473
Brave your way to Grand Central...

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,756
and I'll hand off the tickets
and throw in a hot dog.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,399
You have another one of those?

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,119
But you've already seen <i>Hair.</i>

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,635
Maybe I want to see it again.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,230
Oh, there you are.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,551
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,109
Thank you both for your hospitality.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,714
- Thank you again.
- It was lovely.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,152
Consider what I said about the pool.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,391
That is the end of the welcome wagon.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,433
We'll basically have to move to get
someone to make dinner for us.

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,951
What was that about the pool?

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,077
He's insistent we all go skinny-dipping.

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,629
Ha! Let him get his own pool.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,791
- Turn it off.
<i>- ... under almost constant enemy shelling...</i>

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,669
<i>since ground attacks
commenced on January 2 1.</i>

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,719
<i>Turning now to North Korea,
the</i> Pueblo <i>situation-</i>

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,110
I need to put it in the mail today
and the tailor.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,271
Sylvia, sweetheart-

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,509
Good morning.

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,910
- Morning.
- Morning.

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,312
- Honey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,596
I'll swing by the bank at lunch.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,279
I give her cash every month...

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,591
but I think she's secretly
sending it all to our kid.

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,675
You don't have to explain anything.

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,871
You're lucky your wife works.

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,952
- She doesn't earn much.
- Not yet.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,273
I forgot my cigarettes.

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,673
You got to stop that nonsense.

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,750
Listen, don't worry about dinner Wednesday.
We'll have money by then.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,312
Looking forward to it.

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,717
I knew it'd be you.

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,959
It wasn't all bad. I got me some memories.

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,554
And the boy.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,438
Don't know what it is yet.

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,034
I mean Dick here.

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,351
Well, hello there.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,080
This is Mack.
He's with me, so he's your uncle.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,511
We thank the Lord
for opening your rooms to us.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,071
All I said was,
"My sister's coming with her boy."

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,833
Mack's the one that brung ya.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,633
I'd do the same for mine.

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,475
And, of course, Ernestine told you we could
always use a little help around here.

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,280
Let's get you off your feet.

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,353
Dick, you help Mack with the bags.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,315
You keep your eyes down
and mind your own business here.

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,475
Good-looking kid. He yours?

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,438
Not that I know.

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,160
Little boy, find your own sins.

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,351
Stay away from Mack's.

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,232
Afternoon, Charlotte.

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,754
Hey, kid, you were raised
on a farm. Am I right?

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,399
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,200
Well, I'm the rooster around here,
understand?

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,033
You help all the hens?

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,917
And I'll bring on the day.

83
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,233
I feel bad.

84
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,152
You should. I have to go to work.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,038
You get to sleep.

86
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,589
No, about dinner.

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,152
I thought there was no smoking.

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,436
I just found out the maid smokes.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
She doesn't sleep in here, does she?

90
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,110
You don't mind sitting across the table
from your wife and my husband?

91
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,593
I don't think about it.

92
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,511
They're both good company.

93
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,794
They are.

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,879
I suppose that has nothing
to do with this.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,879
This didn't happen.

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,670
Just in here.

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,077
You're right.

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,676
<i>Every hour on the hour,
WQXR brings you the latest news-</i>

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,355
I only said yes
because Arnold wants to impress you.

100
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,035
I only said yes
because Megan keeps asking.

101
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,954
- She likes you.
- And I like her.

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,069
<i>Vietcong raiders drove into the center of
seven major Vietnamese cities early today...</i>

103
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,597
<i>burning government buildings,
freeing prisoners from provincial jails...</i>

104
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,672
<i>and blasting military installations
and airfields.</i>

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,400
It's 9:00. I have to go.

106
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,949
You love to go.

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,195
Well, it's nice to know
that no matter what...

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,795
we got something done today.

109
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,036
You found it in the cookie jar.

110
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,919
I have money. I just never <i>have</i> money.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,516
<i>The earliest attack took place at Da Nang,
the second-largest city in the country...</i>

112
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,876
<i>and the base area of military operations-</i>

113
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,920
Mr. Mathis and Mr. Gifford
are waiting outside.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,559
Because they don't want to come in.

116
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,594
Look, Phyllis, I've had their job.

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,876
I know.
And you've had my job too.

118
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,636
So you know it wouldn't hurt
if you were to act like-

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,713
if you were as encouraging
to them as you are to me.

120
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,154
Just get me whatever book you read
and save me these little lectures.

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,038
More coffee?

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,477
She's ready for you.

123
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,235
Have a seat.

124
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,430
- No, don't.
- What's wrong with them?

125
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,637
The strategy is, Clearasil stops blemishes
that keep you from having fun.

126
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,394
That means no one should be having fun.

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,313
Okay. So we'll just start over.

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,114
Just a minute.

129
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,478
I don't want you to think
that just because I have high standards...

130
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,280
that means I'm not happy with you.

131
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,990
Especially, you know, the way you are.

132
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,832
The way you are has nothing to do
with the fact that the work needs work.

133
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,995
Thank you, Coach. We'll try our best.

134
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,912
There you go.

135
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,312
Please, dear. Don't linger in the hallway.

136
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,232
Your coat?

137
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,800
Can I get you something to eat?

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
I think I have some peanuts
and some cheese crackers.

139
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,797
No, thank you.

140
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,599
Perhaps something to drink?

141
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,072
I have bourbon, vodka, gin.
Champagne?

142
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,311
I shouldn't. I started on the train.

143
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,355
- What kind of music do you like?
- None for me.

144
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,197
Is the temperature okay?

145
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,954
Yes.

146
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,111
Hmm.

147
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,999
It's been known to get hot.

148
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,349
I'm fine.

149
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,352
That's a pretty shade of lipstick.

150
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,839
Thank you.

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,517
I'm glad you came.

152
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,034
Come with me.

153
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,911
DDB managed to get me on the 50-yard line
for the Giants game last November.

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,515
If we'd done it,
the Steelers would have won.

155
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,598
We'd do anything to make you happy.

156
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,717
I'm not unhappy with DDB.

157
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,712
No notes.

158
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,520
When I presented the numbers
for my division...

159
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,389
Timmy came up to me and said,
"How the hell did you do that?"

160
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,235
So I figured he's in town,
why not take him to the horse's mouth?

161
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,240
The past few years,
I've overseen ketchup to great success.

162
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,676
But how long before we're old news?

163
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,798
And, hell, when I saw baked beans
have a sales spike like that-

164
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,355
Raymond has demanded our best work.

165
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,194
So then the question is,
what can we do for you?

166
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,919
What can we do for ketchup?

167
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,389
Let me know.

168
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,399
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.

169
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,957
This isn't an official visit.
I'm just dropping by.

170
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,397
Ken, Don and I have a little
beans housekeeping, if you don't mind.

171
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,199
I'd love to walk you out.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,754
Raymond, we're grateful
for this opportunity...

173
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,275
and consider it
quite a vote of confidence.

174
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,194
It is, but I don't want you
to waste your time.

175
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,634
Well, then if nothing else,
we appreciate the introduction.

176
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,234
I'm not winking here.

177
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,280
There is to be no further communication
with Timmy or his division.

178
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,875
I'm sorry, Raymond.
Did we do something to upset you?

179
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,520
You guys are doing a bang-up job.

180
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,320
And now that polished Polack
wants the same.

181
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,198
I'll take that drink.

182
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,160
No one's paid attention to me
in nine years at the company.

183
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,118
They gave me a suicide mission.

184
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,795
Vinegar, sauces and baked beans.

185
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,440
And then in my moment of triumph,
he comes up to me...

186
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,352
and he didn't say, "How did you do that?"

187
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,113
He said, "How did <i>you</i> do <i>that?"</i>

188
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
Smug bastard.
I taught him everything he knows.

189
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,233
- We understand, Raymond.
- No, forget it.

190
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,835
I know ketchup's the gold standard.

191
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,600
But after all we've been through,
I'm sure I don't need to tell you...

192
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,674
that if you so much as send him
a ham at Christmas, well-

193
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,156
I'd rather retire than watch that guy
screw my girlfriend.

194
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,317
- Let me walk you out.
- No.

195
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,596
If he lingered at all...

196
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm gonna pretend
I'm on my way to the men's room.

197
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,991
I'm sorry. What a waste of time.

198
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,799
I don't know. We met Timmy.

199
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,634
- He's certainly going places.
- Raymond's so weak.

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,758
But he brought his business here
when we were barely standing.

201
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,309
It's Heinz Ketchup, Don.

202
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,835
It's the Coca-Cola of condiments.

203
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,673
I know.

204
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,514
But sometimes you've gotta dance
with the one that brung ya.

205
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,794
I'm afraid that's the end
of your toilet paper.

206
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,440
This place could really use
a woman's touch.

207
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,193
You think so?

208
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,636
I might come to town Friday.

209
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,837
There's always a sale at Macy's.

210
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,912
We'll see.

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,151
Okay. I'll call you.

212
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,713
If I let the phone ring once and hang up,
then you'll know it's me.

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,473
Don't do that.

214
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,280
Well, I'm going to park my car...

215
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,829
in front of the driveway
instead of in the driveway.

216
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,957
Then you'll know I'm thinking of you.

217
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,354
That's sweet.

218
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,958
I really have to get back.
Can you move it along a little?

219
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,872
You told me you were
washing these by hand.

220
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,634
- No wonder the elastic's shot.
- I forgot.

221
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,518
And you forgot
you left the vacuum on the terrace.

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,915
I was changing the bag.

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,595
And you forgot not to use
SOS on the Teflon.

224
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,478
I mean, I leave for work every day...

225
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,791
and I wonder what you're
going to ruin in my house.

226
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.

227
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,639
I don't know how to do this,
but you're fired.

228
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,469
I'll get my things.

229
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,793
- I'm sorry.
- No.

230
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,998
I walked in on it,
and then I didn't want to pretend.

231
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,153
Are you okay, honey?

232
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,754
No.

233
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,713
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

234
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,757
I don't want to go up until she's gone.

235
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,433
Along with your silverware.

236
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,515
So after weeks, I finally show him
the picture of my mother...

237
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,594
but that's not enough because her name
has been changed in the will.

238
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,911
That is quite a story line.

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,560
Well, you asked.

240
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,474
- It's meaty, isn't it?
- It is.

241
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,520
I just wish watching TV during the day
didn't make me feel so guilty.

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,318
I had a miscarriage.

243
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,472
All right. I will watch.

244
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,039
No, um, in real life.

245
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,555
Two days ago.

246
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,712
I'm so sorry to hear that.

247
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't burden you with this.

248
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,274
No, you obviously need to talk.

249
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,230
I was sloppy in Hawaii-

250
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,399
the time difference, vacation.

251
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,396
Now I feel so guilty.

252
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,074
May I?

253
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,754
What do you have to feel guilty about?

254
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,793
What did Don say?

255
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,753
I didn't tell him.

256
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,238
It's been a hard couple of weeks.

257
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,551
Oh.

258
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,394
I don't know why.

259
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,518
I mean, I do.

260
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,350
You were raised the same way I was.

261
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,639
I keep hearing Sister Eugenie in my head.

262
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,757
I'm such a horrible person.

263
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,080
You're not a horrible person.

264
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,516
No, I am.

265
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,114
I mean...

266
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,840
to be pregnant now...

267
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,639
at this moment?

268
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,758
I didn't know what I wanted to do...

269
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,151
and I was so relieved
that I didn't have to do anything.

270
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,120
I see.

271
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,800
Has this ever happened to you?

272
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,315
About a year after I had Mitchell.

273
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,551
So I certainly understand
some of what you're feeling.

274
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,632
But the rest of it...

275
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,198
no.

276
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,112
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,078
Really?

278
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,312
Because I was raised the same way, so...

279
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,471
I would never even
consider that my decision.

280
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,359
- You really believe that?
- I do.

281
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,634
And I think you do, too,
or you wouldn't feel this way.

282
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,991
I just feel so shitty.

283
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,477
I'm sorry I brought it up.

284
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,239
Hello.

285
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,839
Hello.

286
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,799
- Sylvia's here.
- I see that.

287
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,236
Hello.

288
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,680
I should be going.

289
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,036
You don't have to rush off.

290
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,671
- Have a drink.
- No, I'll leave you two alone.

291
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,119
- I fired the maid today.
- Good riddance.

292
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,032
Good night, both of you.

293
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,713
See you tomorrow.

294
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,599
- Excuse me?
- For dinner.

295
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,717
Oh, of course. Yes.

296
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,920
So send her in.

297
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,469
Sorry to bother you,
but this was on my desk.

298
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Is it new?

299
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,553
There's usually a memo
for everything around here.

300
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,677
- What is it?
- It's Quest.

301
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,754
Feminine... hygiene powder.

302
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,230
- Did I miss a meeting?
- "Proof points-

303
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,518
has baking soda,
makes you nicer if you're stinky...

304
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,160
kills overly critical bacteria."

305
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,953
"Target-
professional women and other Olsons."

306
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,954
Just give it to me.

307
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,270
Calm down. I think
this is somebody's idea of a joke.

308
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,636
Of course, when you want them
to be funny, they're useless.

309
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,472
Hello, gorgeous.

310
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,792
Hello, Herb.

311
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,157
Did you get all gussied up for me?

312
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,799
No.

313
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
I had no idea you'd be
darkening my doorway.

314
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,956
When are you gonna come out to the lot?

315
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,635
I told you, I'll let you have a Jaguar
for as long as you like.

316
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,393
I take the bus.

317
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,518
I know there's a part of you
that's glad to see me.

318
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,991
And I know there's a part of you
you haven't seen in years.

319
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,434
Herb! There you are.

320
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,079
How are you today?

321
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,992
Toodle-oo.

322
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,115
<i>- Mrs. Harris is here to see you.</i>
- He's here.

323
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,637
Thank you.

324
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,956
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob Benson.

325
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,032
We've met before. I'm part of the team.

326
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,672
Doesn't the elevator go up to this floor?

327
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,357
Herb. What brings you by?

328
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,952
I had some thoughts, the complexity of which
could not be expressed over a telephone.

329
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,554
What is it you want?

330
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,634
Well, you guys are gonna make some
fancy-schmancy Michelangelo TV spot...

331
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,155
and the dealers are gonna
foot most of the bill for running it.

332
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,118
That's how it works.

333
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,874
Well, I'm the only guy
actually out there selling hamburgers...

334
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,192
and I want people to know
there's a hamburger store in Englewood...

335
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,636
not England or in your mind.

336
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,997
I don't want another thing with some
schmuck sitting on his lawn mower...

337
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,517
fantasizing that he's gonna win
the Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.

338
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,319
I need foot traffic.

339
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,278
Get 'em in the door so I can move metal.

340
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,671
Well, you, along with the factory guys...

341
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,434
have already signed off on the work
as well as the buy.

342
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,519
I just think there should
be retail radio as well.

343
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,000
You know?

344
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,914
"Does your car sound like this?"
Voom voom!

345
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,437
"Does your wife sound like this?"
"Ooh, I love your car."

346
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,592
And then you say the phone number twice.

347
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,196
Wonderful. We'd love to increase
the exposure of the campaign.

348
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,873
How much more would you like to buy?

349
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,840
There's no increase.
Just adjust the proportions.

350
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,997
I think we should spend
60% of the money...

351
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,198
on local dealership ads
instead of national.

352
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,115
Herb, that would really take a bite
out of the national campaign.

353
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,351
Well, if you say so.

354
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,114
Unfortunately, it's not up to me...

355
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,116
so I am suggesting that you
recommend this plan to all of us.

356
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,510
Why don't you recommend it?
It's your idea.

357
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,877
Because it's an idea you had yourself.

358
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,518
And Lord knows you're so damn persuasive.

359
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,796
We understand, Herb.

360
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,792
See how easy that was, Bob?

361
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,474
Bob, why don't you show me the sights?

362
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,394
You must be like a kid
in a candy store out here.

363
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,317
Vavoom, vavoom.

364
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,480
- You can't shake his hand?
- He didn't seem interested.

365
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,678
In fact, the only thing he seemed interested in
was gutting our national campaign.

366
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,434
You do realize that defeats
the purpose of having Jaguar?

367
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,836
So he's demanding and unreasonable.

368
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,436
How does that make him different from
the other people who walk through that door?

369
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,558
I wish you would handle the clients
as well as you're handling me.

370
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,358
<i>Jimmy's Condom Warehouse,
where the rubber meets the road.</i>

371
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,797
<i>- Jimmy speaking.</i>
- You want a drink?

372
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,032
No, thank you. I'm quite comfortable.

373
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,318
<i>How was your day, honey?</i>

374
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,876
- Okay.
<i>- Okay?</i>

375
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,758
What happened to Shangri-La?

376
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,036
Chaough quit crapping out snow cones?

377
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,238
Everyone hates me here.

378
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,913
Well, that was bound to happen.

379
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,394
You worked for me, and you like me.

380
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,752
- I worked <i>with</i> you.
- I was tough but fair.

381
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,399
<i>Oh, speaking of people who hate you...</i>

382
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,676
<i>Raymond J. Beans came in today
and pulled a real boner.</i>

383
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,274
Go on.

384
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,990
- He brought in the head of ketchup.
- He's obsessed with that man.

385
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,514
Yeah, he should be. I met him.

386
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,592
So Raymond makes the introduction...

387
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,593
and then, according to Ken,
ketchup leaves, but Raymond lingers...

388
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,831
and he says he's gonna
kill the account and himself...

389
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,599
if they even talk to ketchup again.

390
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,750
- Why'd he bring him in?
<i>- Because he's Raymond.</i>

391
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,917
He's a fraidycat.

392
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,959
And- here's the part
that's gonna make you happy-

393
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,954
Kenny spent two weeks telling everybody
how he was getting ketchup.

394
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,680
Okay, Tuesday morning is perfect.

395
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,275
<i>What? Oh, yep.</i>

396
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,710
<i>We'll have your wig ready then, ma'am.</i>

397
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,552
You're allowed to make
personal calls after 5:00...

398
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,199
especially if they make you laugh.

399
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,956
My friend Stan was telling me a funny story
about one of our old clients.

400
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,834
- What happened?
- Oh, it's complicated.

401
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,709
But basically the guy from Heinz Baked Beans
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.

402
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,280
Of course he does.

403
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,320
Well, surprisingly, beans brought ketchup
in for a meeting at the agency...

404
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,629
and everyone got excited...

405
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,878
and then, unsurprisingly,
he sent ketchup out of the room...

406
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,758
and told everyone it was just for show.

407
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,832
So he's unhappy?

408
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,233
He's not going anywhere.

409
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,959
Probably misses you.

410
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,072
No. I assure you, he doesn't.

411
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,359
There's nothing like things going badly
when you leave, is there?

412
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,634
Sorry I'm late.

413
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,473
Third Avenue was a parking lot.

414
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,792
I'm not feeling well.

415
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,712
That's not where it hurts.

416
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,877
Oh. Did you cancel?

417
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,032
No, I thought I'd feel better
by the time you got home.

418
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,237
We're supposed to be there in 15 minutes.

419
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,039
They're probably already there.

420
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,273
I know, but I don't want to pretend
like I'm having a good time...

421
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,192
and it's too late to cancel.

422
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,000
- They'll survive.
- I want you to go.

423
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,837
I want you to have fun.

424
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,160
Okay.

425
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,556
But you go right to bed.

426
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,040
Yes, sir.

427
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,273
<i>Willis Reed replaces Nate Bowman.</i>

428
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,431
Go away!

429
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,352
Somebody help me!

430
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,437
What on earth is that?

431
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,034
Somebody, please!

432
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,198
Somebody help!

433
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,719
- Oh, my goodness!
- What happened to you?

434
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,269
Hey, Campbell! She's your problem now!

435
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,032
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.
He was chasing me.

436
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,152
Close the door.

437
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,074
- Hold this to your nose.
- What the hell happened?

438
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,117
I'm so embarrassed.

439
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,592
We had a terrible fight.

440
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,673
- I'm going to call the authorities.
- No, please.

441
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,639
- Well, then I'm taking you to the hospital.
- I'll be fine.

442
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,991
What do you think you're doing?
You're not going back there.

443
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,117
Peter, go to Tammy's bathroom.
There's some cotton wool.

444
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,359
I'll be right back.

445
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

446
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,472
Oh, don't worry about it. I was late too.

447
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,553
They already gave us a hard time.
Where's your wife?

448
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,313
She sends her regrets.
She wasn't feeling well.

449
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,357
That's too bad.

450
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,716
- You look lovely.
- Let's get you a drink.

451
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,474
We'll get the waiter
to do the whole show again.

452
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,557
I'm afraid there's only
going to be three of us.

453
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,199
- Don?
- Old-fashioned, please.

454
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,760
<i>Subito.</i>

455
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,511
Well, the North Koreans
really took that ship.

456
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,796
And the Vietcong-
did you see them storming the embassy?

457
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,633
I haven't followed it today.

458
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,717
- We got it back.
- Still.

459
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,031
These two little pissant countries
handing our head to us.

460
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,759
Well, I don't know about the ship...

461
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,638
but from what I've read,
the embassy was an ambush.

462
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,200
They broke the cease-fire.

463
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,715
We gave them peace
for their sacred holiday.

464
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,237
Next thing we know,
they cut us to ribbons.

465
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,195
Reminds me of Cuba.
No one took Fidel Castro seriously.

466
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,473
We thought he was Señor Wences.
Turns out he was George Washington.

467
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,999
- And they say surgeons are arrogant.
- Who says that?

468
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,476
You know we're losing the war?

469
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,313
You wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

470
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,151
Yeah, it's something. Right?

471
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,551
- You are Dr. Rosen?
- You see this service?

472
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,155
Yes. We'd like to hear the spiel again.

473
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,039
Uh, <i>scusi</i>. There is a telephone call.

474
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,679
Really?

475
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,200
I'll be right back.

476
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,318
I'm gonna take this as an opportunity
to powder my nose.

477
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,519
There's no answer.

478
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,716
Is there anyone else? Family?

479
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,832
My sister's back in Oneonta.

480
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,594
My mother's in Boca Raton.

481
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,475
Well, you can't go home.
We should find a hotel.

482
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,040
Let's try some ice.

483
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,558
What did you say to him?

484
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,111
Hello? Yes. Do you have
any vacancies this evening?

485
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
Take me to the city.
I want to be with you.

486
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,355
Absolutely not.

487
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,160
Very good. Thank you.

488
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,550
The Old Greenwich Inn has rooms.

489
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,394
- Can you take me there?
- We'll get you a taxi.

490
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,392
Nonsense. I'll drive you.

491
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,632
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'll run you over.

492
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,758
Brenda, dear, let's go.
It's best this way.

493
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,553
Emergency averted?

494
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,394
Unfortunately, no.
Sylvia and you are having dinner.

495
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,153
- This is silly.
- We can do this another time.

496
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,074
I'm not taking my foot out of the door
of this restaurant.

497
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,595
Order for four, or they'll punish me.

498
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,717
Good luck.

499
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,039
What are you having?

500
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,032
I don't know that I'm that hungry.

501
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,879
You want another glass of wine?
Should we get a bottle?

502
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,917
You're drinking something else.

503
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,231
I don't want you to have wine
if you don't drink wine.

504
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,152
I'm not gonna drink a whole bottle,
obviously.

505
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,800
I don't know how obvious that is.

506
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,792
Another glass is fine.

507
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,952
So what looks good here?

508
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,794
Depends what you want.

509
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,078
Well, I'm hungry, I'm in a good mood...

510
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,198
and I'd like some guidance on the Italian menu
from my favorite Italian.

511
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,116
I didn't cook it,
so I can't speak to its quality.

512
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,152
You think I'd like eggplant rollatinis?

513
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,349
For the lovely signora?

514
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,671
- We're not ready yet.
- Yes, we are.

515
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,320
Can she have another glass of wine,
and could you give us a minute?

516
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,232
<i>Certo.</i>

517
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,834
What's wrong?

518
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,116
How could I possibly know
what you like to eat?

519
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,953
I thought you were
looking forward to this.

520
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,997
I don't know what we're doing.

521
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,879
We're having dinner together.

522
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,633
And I'm sorry, but I guess
it was a stupid idea...

523
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,872
to think we could spend time together
outside of your maid's room.

524
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,036
Just because they cleared their
place settings doesn't mean we're alone.

525
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,000
Is that what's bothering you-
that everything worked out perfectly?

526
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,151
And you enjoy how foolish they both look.

527
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,193
Now I understand.

528
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,355
You want to feel shitty...

529
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,035
right up until the point
where I take your dress off.

530
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,237
Because I'm going to do that.

531
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,070
You want to skip dinner?
Fine. But don't pretend.

532
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,439
And what if she had come?

533
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,918
The evening would be just the same,
only it would be someone else's dress?

534
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,196
What are you talking about?

535
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,717
Weren't you the one who told me
you were drifting apart?

536
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,757
Isn't that what this was about?

537
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,638
I want <i>you.</i>

538
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,797
<i>I want you all the time.</i>

539
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,070
But if you've suddenly decided
you want something more than that...

540
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,277
well, then, that's news, isn't it?

541
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,116
So, have you decided?

542
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,758
I don't know. Have you?

543
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,760
He'll have the steak diavolo,
and I'll have the branzino.

544
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,196
Anything to start?

545
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,749
No. We're in a bit of a hurry.

546
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,112
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,715
I'm so sorry.

548
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,599
I have no right to be jealous.

549
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,956
This is just us here tonight.

550
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,630
We have to be careful.
We can't fall in love.

551
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,996
It won't be so French anymore.

552
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,719
<i>Hi, this is Johnny Carson. As you know...</i>

553
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,190
<i>this is the usual starting time
for</i> The Tonight Show.

554
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,796
<i>And tonight my guest is the New Orleans
district attorney, Mr. Jim Garrison...</i>

555
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,758
<i>who is with us to discuss, as he puts it...</i>

556
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,992
<i>some new and vital information concerning
the Kennedy assassination.</i>

557
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,391
<i>But because of the critical
war situation in Vietnam...</i>

558
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,712
<i>especially around Saigon,
NBC for the next 15 minutes...</i>

559
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,759
<i>is going to bring you
a special news program via satellite.</i>

560
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,880
<i>So stay with us. We'll return in 15 minutes
with our guest, Mr. Garrison.</i>

561
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,035
Did you have fun?

562
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,794
Arnold had an emergency,
so Sylvia and I had to eat enough...

563
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,917
to keep him in good graces there.

564
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,039
Are you feeling better?

565
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,713
I need to talk to you.

566
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,872
What's wrong?

567
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,599
Um-

568
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,155
Well, I had a miscarriage
a few days ago.

569
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,352
Are you okay?
Did you go to the doctor?

570
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,397
Yes.

571
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,392
How far along were you?

572
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,034
Six weeks.

573
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,993
I wish you would have told me.

574
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,479
I guess I didn't know how you'd feel.

575
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,279
I didn't know what you'd want.

576
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,350
Megan, you have to know
I'd want what you want.

577
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,636
Is that what you want?

578
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,519
Of course it is.

579
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,119
But I don't know that it's even the right time
to have a conversation about it.

580
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,079
And I guess that's why I didn't tell you.

581
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,679
But I should have.

582
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,871
Yes, you should have.

583
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,629
Do you want to have that conversation?

584
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,478
Whenever you want.

585
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,956
Now I can go to sleep.

586
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,354
Good morning.

587
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,477
- Where's Tammy?
- Leticia took her to the park.

588
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,436
Oh.

589
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,638
Well, I'm off.

590
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,518
Couldn't you just pretend?

591
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,954
I let you have that apartment.

592
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,033
Somehow I thought
that there was some dignity...

593
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,191
in granting permission.

594
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,432
All I wanted was for you to be discreet.

595
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,079
She lives on our block!

596
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,516
Trudy, don't jump to conclusions.

597
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,995
There's no way for me to escape,
to not be an object of pity...

598
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,589
while you get to do
whatever you feel like.

599
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,433
I have never said no to you.

600
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,194
That is not true.
What are we doing out here?

601
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,637
We're done, Peter. This is over.

602
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,279
You want a divorce?

603
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,511
I refuse to be a failure.

604
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,432
I don't care what you want anymore.

605
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,239
This is how it's going to work.

606
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,836
You will be here
only when I tell you to be here.

607
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,037
I'm drawing a 50-mile radius
around this house...

608
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,034
and if you so much as open your fly
to urinate, I will destroy you.

609
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,634
Do you understand?

610
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,552
You know what?

611
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,518
You're going to go to bed alone tonight...

612
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,718
and you're going to realize you don't
know anything for sure.

613
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,520
I'll live with that.

614
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,517
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

615
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,478
So far this is all we have...

616
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,234
but I want you to find out
everything you can on Heinz Ketchup.

617
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,039
What?

618
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,032
And this is not a joke.

619
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,674
- No. I can't do that.
- Why not?

620
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,151
It's a little bit of a secret,
but it turns out they're taking meetings.

621
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,590
I told you that secret,
and I shouldn't have.

622
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,354
Look, everybody's gonna know.
We just know a little sooner.

623
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,000
My friend told me that in confidence.

624
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,750
- He's not your friend. He's the enemy.
- Well, he doesn't know that.

625
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,557
Maybe you need a friend
more than you need a job.

626
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,438
I didn't know that. I'm in advertising.

627
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,678
It's not that. It's just that
it was a private conversation.

628
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,713
What are you, his priest?
This is how wars are won.

629
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Your friend's mistake
was underestimating you.

630
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,392
I hope ketchup makes the same mistake
so you can blow their mind.

631
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,000
So, correct me if I'm wrong, Pete.

632
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,680
I certainly will.

633
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,834
You're suggesting that we forgo
this sparkling national ad campaign...

634
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,357
in favor of hard-driving sales ads
at the local dealer level?

635
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,319
Not exactly.
We will still have a national presence...

636
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,040
with the sophisticated work
that Don presented and you loved...

637
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,191
but we will increase sales...

638
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,513
with a surgical and financial focus
on local media.

639
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,240
Well, that sounds good to me.
Of course, I'm a little bit biased.

640
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,277
Why would we do that?

641
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,751
We feel it's best to have a plan
that creates customers...

642
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,513
not just aficionados.

643
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,319
Don, are you really in favor
of throwing our emphasis into radio?

644
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,713
Well, it's hard to argue
with a more direct appeal to customers.

645
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,395
I mean, we can artsy up
the image of Jaguar...

646
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,030
make it look romantic and stylish...

647
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,677
but isn't it better to tell people who are
actually in the market for a car...

648
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,672
that a Jaguar is available?

649
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,119
I think it's an exciting new angle
to use direct sales on a luxury vehicle.

650
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,556
I mean, forget about radio.

651
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,395
How about a mailer
or a circular in the Sunday paper?

652
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,279
I don't know if that's
what we had in mind.

653
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,558
So this is your recommendation?

654
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,118
I think it's better to think about
someone in New Jersey...

655
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,080
driving in their current car and hearing
that right around the corner...

656
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,994
there's a Jaguar to buy
at a low, low price.

657
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,639
I bet the numbers would support that.
Don't they, Harry?

658
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,350
That, uh, is really a statistics game.

659
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,750
You know what?
I will have to double-check.

660
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,957
Look, why are you limiting yourself?

661
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,069
Wouldn't you rather cast a wide net so you
can sell Jaguar to the average guy?

662
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,755
You know, truck drivers, housewives.

663
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,878
I was under the impression,
from the work you showed us...

664
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,997
that this would be
a more elegant approach...

665
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,630
that made the Jaguar seem rare
because, let's face it...

666
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,760
the gentleman who buys our car
needs to be of some means.

667
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,360
I am 100% positive
that this approach moves cars.

668
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,399
And not just Jaguars.
This is proven to move all kinds of cars.

669
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,756
Hell, even used cars. Am I wrong, Herb?

670
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,072
No, he's right. It moves cars.

671
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,074
Gentlemen, we appreciate
the recommendation...

672
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,200
but we believe we should stay
with the proposal as first discussed.

673
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,511
And as persuasive as these arguments were...

674
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,832
that is how we will continue to proceed.

675
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Let's not be too hasty.
Maybe we should listen to them.

676
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,631
At least give it some thought.

677
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,359
Herb's right.

678
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,558
We still believe
this is our best chance for success.

679
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,677
Fellas, this is gonna work.

680
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,832
I'm sorry, but this is our final decision.

681
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,355
Thank you very much.

682
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,472
What the hell was that?

683
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,472
Herb, we couldn't have pushed any harder.

684
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,597
You pushed. Then you let Don talk.

685
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,320
You should know better.
The guy's not a salesman.

686
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,912
That was the deftest
self-immolation I've ever seen.

687
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

688
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,472
I didn't know you were
capable of being that bad.

689
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,240
- What was that in there?
- I wasn't feeling well.

690
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,152
Something about that guy makes me sick.

691
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,074
Don't be cute.
I still have his spit in my hair.

692
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,833
Why can't you just follow the rules?

693
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,832
I did. I did exactly what he asked for.

694
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,674
Not in spirit. You know damn well
that is not what he wanted.

695
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,955
Why do we care what that guy wants?

696
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,157
- Because he's a client.
- Our client.

697
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,119
And so we just keep saying yes,
no matter what...

698
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,157
because we didn't say no to begin with?

699
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,833
You know what this is? It's Munich.

700
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,072
You guys are always talking about Munich.
What the hell does that mean anyway?

701
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,391
It means we gave the Germans whatever
they wanted to make them happy...

702
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,312
but it just made them want more.

703
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,074
Well, who the hell won the war?

704
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,717
As my mother used to say,
"Your options were dishonor or war.

705
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,996
You chose dishonor.
You might still get war."

706
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,833
That was Churchill.

707
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,554
First one in, last one out.
I don't know how you do it.

708
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,033
Me either.

709
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,551
Well, it can't be that bad when you're
doing something that you love.

710
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,030
I'm glad it looks like that to you.

711
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,630
I spent a year in finance...

712
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,952
watching identical men
in identical suits...

713
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,158
sneak drinks out of a desk drawer
while counting other people's money.

714
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,799
What house?

715
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,796
My family's been at Brown Brothers Harriman
for three generations.

716
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,031
You make this look a lot better.

717
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,033
It's all about what it looks like, isn't it?

718
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm going down to the deli.
Can I get you something?

719
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,912
No, thank you.

720
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,400
Bob.

721
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,915
My wife asked me,
and I seem to have forgotten.

722
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,993
Could you pick me up some toilet paper?

723
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,878
I got it, chief.

724
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,997
Good evening.

725
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,517
He's home.
You can't knock on the door like that.

726
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,513
I was taking the trash out,
and you left it open.

727
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,114
Tomorrow morning?

728
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,674
You're a dirty little spy.

729
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,314
I dropped a penny.

730
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,677
You got your own room.
That's how things work around here.
