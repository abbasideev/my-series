1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,276
<i>This convention instructs the Democratic
National Committee...</i>

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,515
<i>that it shall include in the call
for the 1972 convention...</i>

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,116
<i>the following addition to section one-</i>

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,114
<i>quote, it is the further understanding...</i>

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,152
Should I pack your swim trunks?

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,160
What?

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,638
They're supposed to be debating the war.

8
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,599
They can debate it all they want,
they just can't come out against it.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,319
Then no one will vote for Humphrey.

10
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,352
Over Nixon?

11
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,955
Well, they can't have the whole convention
without talking about the war.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,431
Thirty seconds after prime time,
they'll start the debate.

13
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,119
Cops have been hassling
protesters all day.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,998
Also not in prime time.

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,149
- You're so cynical.
- Come over here.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,152
Come with me.
We'll go back to Disneyland.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,596
From what I remember,
something amazing happened there.

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,071
- I made the biggest mistake of my life.
- That's true.

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
You know I'd come if I could.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,235
You'll have fun.
Just stay away from actresses.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,277
Do they have them out there?

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,874
I hate actresses.

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,238
Kenny said that this time
he went to a floor...

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,834
in the Chevy building
he'd never been to before.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,559
He said it was like <i>Get Smart.</i>

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,438
Just a bunch of doors in procession.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,354
And he met the man he believes to be
the source of our current torture.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,035
- What's his name?
- Same as the rest of them- Jack something.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,992
Apparently his feelings were hurt
because we haven't kissed his ring.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,237
Well, I'd be happy to go there
and help soften him up.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,720
If anyone's going, I'm going.

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,759
But you can't because you're going
to Los Angeles for- What again?

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,230
<i>I'm</i> going to pay them a visit immediately.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,152
Don't want to miss our flight.
Are we going?

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,438
- Right after the partners' meeting.
- Oh.

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,871
Are we done here?

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,031
Sweetheart, could you step out?

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,634
This morning I received an envelope
addressed to Sterling Gleason and Pryce.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,871
- From who?
- It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,759
They don't know our name
because we don't know our name.

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,991
Aren't we SCDPCGC?

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,434
Not officially.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,275
Well, I'm tired of the conversation
that goes along with my business card.

44
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,353
I know that no one has observed the memo
that requested specifically...

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,671
that all seven letters be used
when answering the phone.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,595
Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce, Cutler,
Gleason and Chaough? It's a mouthful.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,354
SCDPCGC is a mouthful.

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,717
But CGCSCDP is not.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,360
- I don't agree.
- We've each lost a partner.

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,033
Why don't we each lose a letter?

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,952
SCDC.

52
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,600
- What do the C's stand for?
- Not Campbell.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,514
- Cooper and Cutler.
- Pardon me?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,116
Well, SCDCC. sounds like a stutter
and looks like a typo.

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,309
Very well, if it puts this to rest,
I will gladly withdraw my name...

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,360
along with the other deceased parties
in this conversation.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,636
Bert, don't be a martyr.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,518
Want to throw away both of these brands?

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,671
Just leave it alone.
We'll get a bigger front door.

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,070
Well, of course you like it.
You're at the front.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,117
- I'm at the end.
- I'm at the end.

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,352
Well, I move to table this.
You have fun in Detroit.

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,399
- And you have fun with Manischewitz.
- Any special instructions?

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,871
Yeah, the guy in charge,
just pick an eye and stick with it.

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,316
Very well, but it's my belief
that any further delay...

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,437
in choosing our name
will take it out of our hands...

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,711
and leave it up to the world.

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,750
You know Sunkist is still
only doing print work?

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,111
I'm cutting you off.

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,715
- You're two ahead of me.
- No, from work.

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,917
Come on. We're executives.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,078
Leave the drudgery to Ted Chaough
and the rest of the underlings.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,280
- Did you prepare at all?
- Sunkist, Carnation, the avocado people.

74
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,840
My biggest job in these meetings...

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,480
is to keep them
from saying "golly" too many times.

76
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,836
Carnation has 27 million in billings.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,389
I don't think the guy in charge
ties his pants with a rope.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,995
I didn't say that. But I guarantee they
all have a certain regard...

79
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,594
for two gentlemen from the big city.

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,878
- You mean they won't trust us?
- I mean they don't trust themselves.

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,317
I don't know if you realize it,
but we are big New York admen...

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,756
from an agency
with seven letters in its name.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,752
That means under no circumstances...

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,516
are you to trot out that drawl you do
when you've had too many.

85
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,832
Be slick. Be glib. Be you.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,594
Well, <i>I'm</i> usually informed.

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,834
We're conquistadors.

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,316
I'm Vasco da Gama,
and you're... some other Mexican.

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,199
We're gonna land there, buy whatever
they've got for the beads in our pockets.

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,752
Our biggest challenge
is to not get syphilis. Cathy.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,072
Another round.
And send one to the pilot.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,432
<i>... hours of a crimonious debate...</i>

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,716
<i>the Democratic National Convention
has rejected a plank...</i>

94
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,837
<i>advanced by Democratic doves...</i>

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,278
<i>calling for an unconditional end
to all bombing of North Vietnam.</i>

96
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,637
<i>- The discussion was conducted-</i>
- What's going on?

97
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,155
They delayed till noon,
and then they rejected it.

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,800
- Rejected what?
- The peace plank.

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,951
A chance to have
a platform against the war.

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,192
Uh-huh. Then let me clarify my question.

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,919
What's going on with
the work for Manischewitz?

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,719
Because you're for the war.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,110
You know there's
200 body bags every week.

104
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,953
Figure out how to get
into that business yet?

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,153
I refuse to be distracted by events in which
I have no actual stake or participation.

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,074
- How could you say that?
- Because he doesn't have any sons.

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,391
I served in the Air Force. Did you?

108
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,836
You're disgusting, you know that?

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,879
This whole thing works because people like
you look the other way.

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,429
- Ginsberg.
- My politics are private.

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,034
But that presentation isn't.

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,516
Now, are you gonna hide your dawdling
behind your outrage?

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,273
You'll have your work, and you know it.

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,239
You can go in there
and take credit for it like you always do.

115
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,916
Be friendly and charming after you've
stuck your fascist boot on my neck!

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,276
So I'm a fascist because
I gave you a deadline?

117
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,876
No, you're a fascist because you love
business, and you hate everything else-

118
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,872
freedom, blacks, Jews.

119
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,078
- This is my stop.
- I hate hypocrites.

120
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,551
Like hippies who cash checks from
Dow Chemical and General Motors.

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,474
You rooting for the Soviets
in Prague, too, you Nazi?

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Michael, what are you doing?
That man is your boss.

123
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,352
Why are you always down here?
Go back upstairs!

124
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,517
You're a truncheon, Cutler!

125
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,829
Thanks for making that worse.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,318
Hello, Ted.

127
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,550
You busy?

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,835
Extremely.

129
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,629
I think you know
I'm a man without regrets...

130
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,030
but I do believe
we fired the wrong people...

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,032
and I'd like to remedy that immediately.

132
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,033
Jim, I think you're upset.

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,032
No, because I have a solution.

134
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,351
I think we should remove
the rest of their people...

135
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,591
while Sterling, Draper
and Crane are in California.

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,196
Just lock the gates
and leave Pete Campbell as the doorman.

137
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,636
- What happened?
- Do I need cause?

138
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,350
How about failure to complete tasks
coupled with gross insubordination?

139
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,716
Maybe part of it is
you keep seeing this agency...

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,598
as our people and their people.

141
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,195
Well, how about your people and my people?

142
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,069
Do I have permission to clean out
creative, starting with Mr. Ginsberg?

143
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,799
Jim, he's lightning in a bottle!

144
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,759
You have to start holding hands,
starting with his.

145
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,873
Because I'll be in Detroit tomorrow,
and you're taking him to Manischewitz.

146
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,520
Sterling's client and Draper's boy.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,673
I'm the world's most expensive babysitter.

148
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,955
That's the spirit.

149
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,955
I suppose I wouldn't
be a good friend if I didn't ask-

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,952
is Kate pulling her weight
around there?

151
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,350
She arranged this.

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,238
She did.

153
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,390
Well, Kate told me that
you're the kind of woman...

154
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,392
who won't just tell me
what I want to hear.

155
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,437
I hope she didn't make any promises.

156
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,760
My wife always says I'm the kind of man
who doesn't like to ask for directions.

157
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,711
My new job has me
face-to-face with ad agencies.

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,314
I don't know what I'm doing.

159
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,479
Kate said you were divorced.

160
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,999
I am. I forgot.

161
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120
What does that say?

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,955
Anyway, what should I look for
in an agency?

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,952
Oh, well, a good agency should tell you.

164
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,670
Go ahead.

165
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,194
Me?

166
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,640
That's why I'm here.

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,152
Yes.

168
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,833
Of course.

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,477
Well, I suppose we don't just lean on
stylish creative and market research.

170
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,753
We listen to the client.

171
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,837
Doesn't everybody do that?

172
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Despite your modesty, you already know...

173
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,395
that the way to get invited into people's
homes is through their TV sets.

174
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,633
Media placement is part science,
part courage.

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,394
Anyone can tell you not to
run makeup ads during football.

176
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,640
The trick is finding your customers
in places you hadn't thought to look.

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,837
Harry Crane is a wizard.

178
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,833
They use a computer
the size of this restaurant.

179
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,639
And what is your job there?

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,519
I'm in charge of thinking of things
before people know they need them.

181
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,480
- I've got this.
- Come on.

182
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,394
Please, this is what I get paid to do.

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,752
I was just coming to see you.

184
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,359
- But you're not going anywhere.
- I was, but then you appeared.

185
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,473
At the risk of playing defense...

186
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,917
I only interfered
because I hate disrespect.

187
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,074
I don't know what you're
talking about.

188
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,357
- Neither do I.
- Hmm.

189
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,036
I believe in you, Bob.
But you're untested.

190
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,557
Manischewitz, tomorrow afternoon-
think you can handle the parties involved?

191
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,911
Michael Ginsberg or the clients?

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,912
I don't see much difference,
do you?

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,072
I think I can keep the volume down.

194
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,992
Excellent.

195
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,356
I welcome this chance to shine.

196
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,070
Hmm.

197
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,115
- Are you on a deadline?
- No, do you need me?

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,193
- I need a drink.
- Okay.

199
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,593
I had this lunch my friend Kate set up,
and I think it's a potential client.

200
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,592
- I know he is.
- Who is he?

201
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,592
The new head of marketing at Avon.

202
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,996
I thought it was a date,
but it turned out to be better.

203
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,673
- I love Avon.
- Of course.

204
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,319
And you'd be perfect for it.

205
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,156
It's just- I don't know what to do with it.
He's leaving town tomorrow.

206
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,833
So set a meeting.

207
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,752
I know I have to, but Don's not here...

208
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,513
and I don't want to
get kicked off the diving board.

209
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,752
We'll take it to Ted.
He'll know what to do.

210
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,799
- What did I just say?
- He's not like that.

211
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,631
- And what do I ask for?
- I don't know.

212
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,791
You'll be the account man
if that's what you want.

213
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,153
Trust me, he loves new business.

214
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,994
He doesn't care where it comes from.
Let's go.

215
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,239
- I told you I wanted a rental car.
- They insisted.

216
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,391
- Ted, do you have a minute?
- Just barely.

217
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,200
Well, it's kind of urgent.
Joan has a solid lead.

218
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,078
He's leaving tomorrow.
We need to set a meeting.

219
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,072
Good for you.
Get Pete Campbell down here.

220
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,153
- Who is it?
- It's Avon Cosmetics.

221
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,633
Very groovy.

222
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,315
The new head of marketing, he's a friend
of a very close friend of mine...

223
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,880
and I just wanted
to introduce him to Peggy.

224
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,031
- Peggy'd be perfect for it.
- You rang?

225
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,232
- Pete, as head of new business-
- Since when? I don't want that.

226
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,913
Joan has a lead for Avon Cosmetics.

227
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,874
Peggy's creative.
He's leaving town tomorrow. Reel him in.

228
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,836
Fly safe.

229
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,599
Avon Cosmetics.

230
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,876
That's Fortune 500. What's his name?

231
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,838
Andy Hayes.

232
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,516
My friend Kate just moved there from
Mary Kay, and she sent him my way.

233
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,877
Tell me everything you can about him and
set lunch tomorrow for Peggy and me.

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,792
I should be there.

235
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,190
Joan, this is how things get botched.

236
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,033
First, account man and creative.

237
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,839
Then if all goes well, next trip...

238
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,116
he visits the office,
and you show him around.

239
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,590
I think he'll be expecting me.

240
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,399
Shouldn't Joan make the introductions?

241
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,119
I don't understand what the problem is.

242
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,197
You're going to make the call...

243
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,114
and tell him how important I am,
and how exciting Peggy is.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,874
And then we're going to
tell him how essential you are.

245
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,631
Don't worry. You'll get all the credit.

246
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,437
Clara. Are you coming?

247
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,991
Geez.
Hey, I let you sit up front.

248
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,515
Sorry about that. You need a hand?

249
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
What?

250
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,113
There's no one from G.M. in Los Angeles?

251
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,193
- Get rid of that car.
- And get us something with a roof.

252
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,715
Don't want to show up
to a meeting with bugs in my teeth.

253
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,396
So, you want to take a dip in the pool
or should I just wait in the bar?

254
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,751
- Both have attractive scenery.
- Where's the bellman?

255
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,435
<i>Mañana,</i> Don. Everything's <i>mañana</i> here.

256
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,115
Need to take a shower.
You can wait in the bar if you want.

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,511
- I'm gonna get room service.
- We're gonna go to the Sunset Strip...

258
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,638
- watch a girl dance in a cage.
- That you heard?

259
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,234
Save your strength for tomorrow.

260
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,913
Going to a party in the hills.

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,798
- It's very hip.
- Beverly Hills?

262
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,839
No, <i>the</i> hills.
And it's movies, not TV.

263
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,919
My friend in development at CBS says
it's going to be crawling with moguls.

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,878
- Geez, it's hot here.
- It's a dry heat.

265
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,872
It's a dry heave.

266
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,997
Come on, Don. Let's go to the Strip right
now and get some dinner.

267
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,560
No, I'm gonna turn in.

268
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,439
Tried to sleep on the plane, but somebody
wouldn't stop talking.

269
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,157
Don't worry, I got this.

270
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,836
<i>This is on tape since again
we're not able to cover it live.</i>

271
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,631
<i>The tape you're about to see was made
about 30 to 40 minutes ago.</i>

272
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,190
<i>It was supposed to be a nonviolent
demonstration today.</i>

273
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,477
<i>And one will never know what it was
that made it become violent.</i>

274
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,551
<i>This is directly in front
of what advertises itself...</i>

275
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,996
<i>as the world's largest
and friendliest hotel.</i>

276
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,720
<i>Where at this hour people stand around...</i>

277
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,234
<i>and sit in their rooms
with handkerchiefs...</i>

278
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,279
- Hello.
- Are you watching this?

279
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,555
Yeah.

280
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,273
It's hard to believe no one got killed.

281
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,591
Is that the only measure?

282
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,796
Can you imagine a policeman
cracking your skull?

283
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,439
It would change your whole life.

284
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,432
Honey, they're throwing rocks.

285
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,079
They're prepared for trouble.

286
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,280
<i>In some places, plain clothes men
are helping make the arrests.</i>

287
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,635
On the bright side, Conrad Hilton is
probably in that hotel right now.

288
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,632
Don't make jokes.

289
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,473
Megan, you can't even vote.

290
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,598
But I live here.

291
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,159
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,199
I want you to be careful.

293
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,120
This could easily start a riot.

294
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,431
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

295
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,477
Really?

296
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,711
You can if you want to.

297
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,360
I miss you.

298
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,231
Go for a swim.

299
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,198
It always makes you feel better.

300
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,352
<i>The whole world is watching.</i>

301
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,516
<i>The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching.</i>

302
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,717
<i>There's a break in the arrests now-</i>

303
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,395
We should hang up.
This is costing a fortune.

304
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,597
Try and get some sleep.

305
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,717
You too.

306
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,156
<i>- They're now moving down Balboa Street.</i>
- Bye.

307
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,480
Bye.

308
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,154
So you came after all.

309
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,072
Pete couldn't make it.

310
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,959
What?
How the hell are we supposed to do this?

311
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,236
Don't worry about it. Coffee, please.

312
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,270
I didn't know Ted was
going to handle it that way.

313
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,033
Well, he did.

314
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,954
And Pete's not coming...

315
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,554
because he wasn't invited.

316
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,314
- You can't do that.
- I did it.

317
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,039
If you want to leave, go ahead.

318
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,557
I hope I didn't keep you waiting,
but I was trying to check out.

319
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,950
See, if you were a client,
you could have left your key at the desk...

320
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,316
and we would have attended to that.

321
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,392
Andy Hayes, Peggy Olson.

322
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,312
She's the dynamite
in our creative department.

323
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,834
I don't know about that.

324
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,519
Tomato juice and coffee, please.

325
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,715
I didn't want you to leave New York
without meeting Peggy.

326
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,878
Her expertise has been honed
by her work on Clearasil...

327
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,998
Pond's Cold Cream,
and most relevant, Belle Jolie lipsticks.

328
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,753
I almost worked there.

329
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,912
- Do you remember "Mark your man"?
- I do.

330
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,231
I grew up in an Avon home.

331
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,880
Our lady was Gladys Bowman.

332
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,872
She was very elegant.

333
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,998
My mother would vacuum
the drapes before she came.

334
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,515
Then my sister and I would
fight over the catalog.

335
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,240
- In fact-
- In fact, all women...

336
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,313
have some kind of
personal connection to Avon.

337
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,710
But that doesn't turn into
advertising, now, does it?

338
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,599
Why don't you tell us
your biggest challenge?

339
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,151
We're here to listen.
It's just hard to hide our enthusiasm.

340
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,391
It's true.

341
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,271
Well, they don't bring in a new guy
unless they're expanding or sales are flat.

342
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,114
I'm afraid it's the latter.

343
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,669
Women are working. They're not home.

344
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,514
And hippies don't wear makeup at all.

345
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,594
I'm not sure if we should
try to be "groovier" or nostalgic.

346
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,956
We're somewhere in between right now.

347
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,914
That's about it.

348
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,915
Peggy?

349
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,151
Yes, Joan?

350
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,071
What do you think of your current work?

351
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,753
Besides the fact that it's not working?

352
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,757
It's okay. We didn't do it.

353
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,837
I don't know how to describe it.

354
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,719
Would you say it's unintentionally
old-fashioned?

355
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,032
Yes. Yes, I would.

356
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,192
I'm sure you've thought of this already...

357
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,840
but Joan and I were saying
how convenient it would be...

358
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,118
to have the Avon lady
come to the office maybe during lunch.

359
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,591
Well, they're not resistant to trying
that, just to advertising it.

360
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,876
There's no doorbell in an office.

361
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,911
I only saw a little bit of it
on the morning news...

362
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,832
but I'm sorry I missed
Humphrey's acceptance speech.

363
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,759
I assume he was high-voiced
and desperate.

364
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,480
You're the exception. Early numbers look
like over 80 million people.

365
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,839
Look, we all hated what we saw,
but the Democrats are dead.

366
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,994
It's over.
Not just now, maybe forever.

367
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,272
As you were. Nobody get up.

368
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,272
Nonsense, Jack. Great to see you finally.

369
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,238
Roger Sterling, Don Draper.

370
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,551
George was just laughing
that these riots gave Nixon the election.

371
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,198
I don't think that's
anything to smile about.

372
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,472
And although this boardroom
has been the site...

373
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,918
of many casual political conversations
among better men than us...

374
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,559
this is a business meeting.

375
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,760
You're right, Jack.

376
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,157
Last night was disgusting...

377
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,278
seeing those long-haired fools
shame this country.

378
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,512
You think Richard Nixon
is going to fix that?

379
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,074
I think he's a patriot.

380
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,915
Dutch Reagan is a patriot.
Nixon is an opportunist.

381
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,552
Now why don't you gentlemen
tell us how it's possible...

382
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,677
to devote your energies
to our nutritious...

383
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,913
and delicious Instant Breakfast
and Life Cereal at the same time?

384
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,880
Well, Jack,
your powdered milk and dairy products...

385
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,510
have had a long, successful relationship
with breakfast cereal.

386
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,319
There's no reason to give that up.

387
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,077
And as far as we can tell, Instant
Breakfast has a different target- adults.

388
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,873
They don't eat cereal.

389
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,997
They eat bacon and eggs.

390
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,597
And this is healthier, easier and instant.

391
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,551
And what if we were to say we find
the conflict unresolvable?

392
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,633
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we discussed this over the phone.

393
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,872
This is about a whole different level
of exposure for your products.

394
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,872
All of them.
You should be in game shows.

395
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,758
You should have a presence
on Saturday morning.

396
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,275
Where we'll sit right next
to one of your cereal ads?

397
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,878
- Don?
- Look, Jack, George...

398
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,998
I'm sure you know that we would do
anything to make this work.

399
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,151
We believe that strongly in Carnation.

400
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,917
We believe in the wholesomeness
of both your intentions and your products.

401
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,237
To be frank, we've worked
with New York firms before.

402
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,314
We come in in the morning,
try to get you, everyone's at lunch.

403
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,392
And when people are at lunch around here...

404
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,154
that's just the time
we get a message from you.

405
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,800
And with it comes an attitude...

406
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,349
as if to say we're not
working hard out here.

407
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,598
I can assure you,
it is very much to the contrary.

408
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,991
Look, we're sorry
your last girlfriend hurt you.

409
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,799
We're in your office right now.

410
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,680
Tell us what you have in mind.

411
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,114
What is going on? I just handed you
the business of your life.

412
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,396
What is going on? You just threw it away.

413
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,551
Morning, ladies.

414
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,836
Morning.

415
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,912
Stop that.

416
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,640
What exactly are you planning to do?

417
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,677
Are you trying to intimidate me?

418
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,355
No, that's always been impossible...

419
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,631
because that would require
respect for me or what I do.

420
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,475
I know you want this,
and now you can't have it.

421
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,358
You could've, but now you can't.

422
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,239
It's mine.
And I've been doing account work...

423
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,993
in one form or another
since the day I started.

424
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,952
But you're not in that department.

425
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,560
I never said that to you...

426
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,154
when you stopped filing
and started writing copy.

427
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,720
Yes, you did. Every day.

428
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,350
And it was worse because you made me feel
like I couldn't do it.

429
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,193
I know you can do this.

430
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,999
So why do you think I should give it away?

431
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,753
I worked my way up.

432
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,914
You were so brave, letting Don carry you
to the deep end of the pool.

433
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,593
I never slept with him.

434
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,677
Congratulations.
You really are just like them.

435
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,798
I'm sorry, but I never thought I would be
in the position to say...

436
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,360
"Joan, you've made a mistake."

437
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,750
I have to do it myself, Peggy.

438
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,309
This is the only way I could do it.

439
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,791
Because all that matters now is
who has a relationship with that client.

440
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,360
Who is the client going to call?

441
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,432
Well, I am sick to my stomach...

442
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,477
thinking about what you're going to say
when they find out.

443
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,880
I'll be fine.

444
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,158
<i>Gentlemen, after all...</i>

445
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,870
<i>this business of selling
narrows down to one thing.</i>

446
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,032
<i>Just one thing. Seeing the people.</i>

447
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,158
<i>Show me any man of ordinary ability...</i>

448
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,197
<i>who will go out and earnestly tell-</i>

449
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,634
Benson here.

450
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,676
- Ginzo, you have a visitor.
- Where is he?

451
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,510
Michael?

452
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,796
- What's wrong?
- I feel sick.

453
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,076
I got diarrhea. My mouth is dry.

454
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,959
I didn't sleep last night.
I don't want to go. I'm not going.

455
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,633
Oh, sure. You'll talk to him?

456
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,837
I love you.
You know that. You're a mother hen.

457
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,272
- Michael, you look fine.
- Stop calling me Michael.

458
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,760
We have to go.
It's a very important meeting.

459
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,992
And I don't say that to scare you,
I say that to inspire you.

460
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,311
I'm not scared. I'm a thug.

461
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
I'm a pig. I'm part of the problem.

462
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,750
"Now I am become Death.
Destroyer of worlds."

463
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,719
Come on, buddy. You're not Death.

464
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,314
You got a little stage fright.

465
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,959
Maybe you smoked
too many funny cigarettes.

466
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,032
I never touch that stuff.
It makes you crazy.

467
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,112
I know what you're feeling, and it's fear.

468
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,511
But not fear of failure,
fear of opportunity.

469
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,592
I can't watch this.

470
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,196
Look, you can't put yourself
in the right place at the right time.

471
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,875
You got to be in
the right place all the time.

472
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,273
Listen, man, I can't turn off
the transmissions to do harm.

473
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,999
They're beaming them right into my head.

474
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,436
Damn it, there is no harm in this!

475
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,955
Manischewitz are good people.
They're your people.

476
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,556
And they sell wine
for religious ceremonies of all faiths.

477
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,872
Now pull yourself together
and be the man that I admire.

478
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,913
Tell me the truth. Are you a homo?

479
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,435
There's that sense of humor.

480
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,471
I would like to have her for lunch.

481
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,472
Well, don't have Harry Crane set it up.

482
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,473
He got us very high up
with three major companies.

483
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,677
You forgot because Chevy fell in your lap...

484
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,798
but big accounts require
a golf and dining offensive.

485
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,600
- When are we gonna do that?
- Next time.

486
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,873
Harry, what did I say about that car?

487
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,230
Well, Cindy, these are
my friends Don and Roger.

488
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,993
Pleasure.

489
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,952
There's tacos and booze outside.

490
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,312
If you want a joint,
try the candy dish on the coffee table.

491
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,153
Or make a friend.

492
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,517
- You look familiar.
- You'll have to do better than that.

493
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,319
As you can tell,
there's a different protocol.

494
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,880
I look forward to figuring it out.

495
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,839
Just let me make introductions.
They don't dig business cards.

496
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,035
Who is that? I know him.

497
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,271
Earl Rice from Kodak.
He's their studio rep.

498
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,875
I don't think he was there when you were.
I know he never goes east.

499
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,519
No, not him. Isn't that Danny?

500
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,679
Jesus, he is everywhere.

501
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,558
It's Daniel J. Siegel now.

502
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,836
Danny Siegel?

503
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,395
Producer. And that's Irwin Fields.
He's at Paramount.

504
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,994
What's he doing here?

505
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,833
Probably trying to buy
one of Danny's movies.

506
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,990
Not him.

507
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,957
Roger, Don.
Where've you been all my life?

508
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,838
Come on. This will be fun.

509
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,631
Daniel, my man. Did we interrupt?

510
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,200
It'll keep, man.

511
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,515
Danny. What are you up to these days?

512
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,355
Taking care of business.
That was Irwin Fields.

513
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,593
And this is just Lotus.
She's from Sacramento.

514
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,195
- So how do you know Stephen?
- Oh, I've known Stephen a long time.

515
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,079
Whereas Danny we've only known
for a very short time.

516
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,960
I know these lugs
back from my days in advertising.

517
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,633
More like a day, wasn't it?

518
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,552
Hey, it wasn't my bag. I had to quit.

519
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,916
You didn't quit. You were fired.

520
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,358
Harry, why don't you
introduce me to the bar?

521
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,113
Hmm.

522
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,920
Actually, Danny and I used to be related.

523
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,515
Daniel.

524
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,559
His ex-wife is still my cousin.

525
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,474
You'd like her. She's about your age.

526
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,438
There are small differences.

527
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,432
- Tiny things you'd notice.
- Hmm.

528
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,193
Stephen.

529
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,078
I was just telling Lotus
here how I'm finally...

530
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,833
making a picture with a major studio.

531
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,832
We're gonna do <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

532
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,830
And Stephen over there works for Ben
Kalmenson, president of Warner Brothers...

533
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,116
who's also here somewhere.

534
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,112
He took over from Jack Warner.

535
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,714
You know what, Lotus?

536
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,872
I'm gonna introduce you.

537
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,997
Nice rapping with you, Rog.

538
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,029
So most of the pictures
don't have a lot of score right now.

539
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,430
They like pop songs.
You know, kids want to hear a hit.

540
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,512
I think ads are going that way too.

541
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,114
What kind of ads you do?

542
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,034
Well, we represent
Chevrolet, Mohawk Airlines.

543
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,033
- Where are they?
- The northeast.

544
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,271
Samsonite luggage. Life Cereal.

545
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,350
Well, if times get tough,
I'm gonna look you up, Donny.

546
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,558
I dig jingles,
and I hear the bread's out of sight.

547
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,674
Don, there you are.
Ben Kalmenson's leaving.

548
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,194
I think he's headed to a party in
the canyon.

549
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,112
Should we follow him?

550
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,078
- You know Ben?
- Do you?

551
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,794
I was looking for the restroom.

552
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,760
Well, there's an extra nipple
here when you come back.

553
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,480
It can wait.

554
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,597
Take off your shoes.

555
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,270
Do you like hashish?

556
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,992
I don't know yet.

557
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,675
Hey, man, are you the guy
who came in a taxi?

558
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,191
You don't talk much, do you?

559
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,756
In fact, I'm wondering
if you're hearing a word I say.

560
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,593
Are you tripping?

561
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,879
I've done it five times.

562
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,838
So if you're trying to see through me...

563
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,958
just know that I am this handsome
and this rich.

564
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,592
Don't worry about your hang-ups.

565
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
Lotus, let's split.

566
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,794
Together?

567
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,873
- She's gonna crash in my guesthouse.
- Until her audition?

568
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,440
It's up to her, man.

569
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,513
I'm sure it is. Lotus, honey,
there's no reason to start at the bottom.

570
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,637
Yeah, maybe he can help
your dream come true...

571
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,632
of having your lips on the side of a bus.

572
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,155
What are you gonna do when you fail here?
Keep going west?

573
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,436
Japan's a long walk for those little legs.

574
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,870
Lotus, let's go.

575
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,992
You're lucky I hate violence, man.

576
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,198
Really? I love it.
You know, I was a boxer.

577
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,511
There's nothing like
finding that magic spot...

578
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,080
that'll drop a man to his knees.

579
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,072
You know, unless he's
already starting there.

580
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,280
Hated to do that.

581
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,592
Mmm.

582
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,036
I'm really thirsty.

583
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,079
There's a pool full of water
out there, Don.

584
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,794
I told you, that's not my name.

585
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,118
There you are.

586
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,352
Honey, I-

587
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,797
You're here.

588
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,519
Is that your old lady?

589
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,195
It's cool. It's California.

590
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,590
Everybody shares.

591
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,434
What are you doing here?

592
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,194
I thought I'd surprise you.

593
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,633
How did you find me?

594
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,315
But I live here.

595
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,112
I quit my job.

596
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,510
I couldn't bear to be apart.

597
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,839
And I want to have enough love
for my other surprise.

598
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,350
Really?

599
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,196
What do you think it is?

600
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,192
A second chance.

601
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,399
Come with me.

602
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,195
Everybody's looking for you.

603
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,757
I heard you were here.

604
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,233
Are you in the movie business too?

605
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,917
I'm not pitching for the Dodgers.

606
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,150
What happened?

607
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,199
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

608
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,273
My wife thinks I'm M.I.A.,
but I'm actually dead.

609
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,952
How come you didn't get your arm back?

610
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,032
Dying doesn't make you whole.

611
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,918
You should see what you look like.

612
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,679
Man overboard!

613
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,591
He's fine. Everybody back away.

614
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,673
Is it real?

615
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,197
They took me to breakfast on the way to
the airport and told me Jack signed off.

616
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,273
And he's high enough at Chevy he doesn't
have to run it by the whole outfit and-

617
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,471
<i>Bob Benson to see you both.</i>

618
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,712
They finally let me see the car.
They had clay models. It's not a dog.

619
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,360
I don't mean to interrupt.

620
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,433
- But that's what you're doing.
- Come on in, Bob.

621
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,391
I just got off the phone
with Manischewitz.

622
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,392
Apparently they're putting us in review.

623
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,076
- What happened?
- They barely listened to the presentation.

624
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,119
It was a courtesy.
They haven't liked the work for months.

625
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,192
Shit! Weren't you there?

626
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,431
Well, I thought it was high time
we embraced Bob.

627
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,080
He was going to go.
I talked him out of it.

628
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,836
Roger Sterling let you watch his dog,
and it ran away.

629
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,720
Bob, we appreciate you
handling this like a man.

630
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,716
And as a reward, Ted and I want you
to familiarize yourself with Chevy.

631
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,190
We just found out
we're moving to the next step.

632
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,000
We're going to need
more than Ken in Detroit.

633
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,317
That's music to my ears.

634
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,278
Welcome aboard.

635
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,836
They shouldn't have gone to California.

636
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,560
We're going to bring in Avon.
They gave us Chevy.

637
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,270
Throw in losing Sterling's account,
I think we have a lot of good news.

638
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,113
They're not gonna think that.

639
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,954
You're splitting
this place and not in half.

640
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,078
We'll give them something
to take their mind off it.

641
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,753
What do we have?

642
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,200
You caught a cold in California.

643
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,431
I don't know what happened.

644
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,751
I usually feel better out there.

645
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,153
You've got to stop talking in the past.
You know what I learned?

646
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,278
New York is the center of the universe.

647
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,718
We could send a landing craft out there,
but they don't understand what we do.

648
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,712
Or they understand it thoroughly.

649
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,954
My shrink says the job of your life
is to know yourself.

650
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,397
Sooner or later, you'll start
to love who you are.

651
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,513
And apparently I'm a curious child...

652
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,877
with a full head of hair
and a thriving business.

653
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,073
And you're a terrible swimmer.

654
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,480
Come in.

655
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,598
Mr. Campbell wants to see you
in the conference room.

656
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,998
Oh. And what is it regarding?

657
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,754
Avon sent over a box
of samples to the girls...

658
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,638
and Diane opened it, not me.

659
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,113
I'll be right in.

660
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,952
Everyone out!

661
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,356
She'll be right in.

662
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,799
This shouldn't be in here.

663
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,754
What the hell is this?

664
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,400
I guess Avon's serious.

665
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,153
Oh, they're serious.

666
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,800
When the hell did you have
a "productive breakfast"?

667
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,312
- You and Peggy ditched me.
- Peggy didn't know.

668
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,596
There was some confusion,
and then it was too late.

669
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,275
- And I thought since I mixed things up-
- There was no confusion!

670
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,560
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I bet you are.

671
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,831
Were you coming in here to celebrate
what a fool I am?

672
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,957
You upset the girls.
They have nothing to do with this.

673
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,872
So, you opening up your own agency?

674
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,633
Ted assigned her.

675
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,837
Isn't the point that Avon's happy?

676
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,957
Oh, I bet you're making him very happy.

677
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,430
Because it's better
than being screwed by you.

678
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,830
We'll see what Ted has to say about this.

679
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,473
Let me handle Ted.

680
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,392
It's too late for that.

681
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,836
Ask her.

682
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,240
Did you meet with Avon
and not invite Pete?

683
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,470
It was very last-minute.

684
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,233
Peggy, this doesn't concern you.

685
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,314
<i>It's unacceptable, and I'd like to know
what you have to say for yourself.</i>

686
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,960
- Does this color look good on me?
- Shh!

687
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,231
What would you like for me to say?

688
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,154
Joan, you of all people
can't plead ignorance.

689
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,154
She's going to say something
about her client and her connection.

690
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,596
And, honestly, I take no issue with that.

691
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,071
But what we have here is a breach of
the fundamental rules of this business.

692
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,516
<i>An account executive signs business...</i>

693
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,872
and they send their junior to maintain it.

694
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,953
To maintain their boss's relationship.

695
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,473
The entire thing falls apart
if I send you to the store to get cake...

696
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,472
and you eat it on the way home.

697
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,395
Did you really try to squeeze him out?

698
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,918
<i>You have nothing
to say for yourself, then?</i>

699
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,954
It's a revolt!

700
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,312
- Excuse me.
- Meredith, not now.

701
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,475
"Joan, Andrew Hayes from Avon
is on the phone for you."

702
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,835
Oh, it just gets better.

703
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,271
What are you waiting for? Go take it.

704
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,039
<i>- That's it?</i>
- Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

705
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,396
Only where there is no law.

706
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,631
Pete, we're all working together.

707
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,791
All agency business is your business.

708
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,795
Thank you.

709
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,997
You better hope he really calls.

710
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,591
Welcome back. How was your trip?

711
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,512
If you don't mind, this is urgent.

712
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,671
Aren't you glad you
didn't go straight home?

713
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,838
I have to tell you that in your absence,
things have become quite dire.

714
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,273
Mr. Draper,
the partners are here.

715
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,476
Come in.

716
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,600
Welcome back. How was California?

717
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,554
It was a series of busts
and not the kind I like.

718
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,275
Well, we have a bit of news
concerning the firm.

719
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,636
- We should get Joan.
- No.

720
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,519
- Anyone else?
- No, thank you.

721
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,512
My visit to Detroit was a success.

722
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,310
They finally signed off on the strategy.
Even showed me a model of the car.

723
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,915
That's a relief. Good work.

724
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,993
Also, Joan's at the five-yard line
with Avon Cosmetics.

725
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,150
Joan?

726
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,835
Well, well, well. While the cat's away-

727
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,153
Unfortunately,
Manischewitz has put us in review.

728
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,754
Ah, it's been coming for months.

729
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,797
But that's not what
we're here to talk about.

730
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,357
We thought long and hard about what it's
gonna take to make this agency stable.

731
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,990
I'd like to offer what we believe to be
a deferential solution.

732
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,120
They want to call the agency Sterling,
Cooper & Partners.

733
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
Well, we know you like it.

734
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,311
It would depend on Don, Jim, and me
all sharing the blow.

735
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,800
You're willing to do that?

736
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,074
It's the only thing
that's equally offensive to all.

737
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,478
S.C. ampersand P.

738
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,153
I can swallow it if you can.

739
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,152
I don't think I should weigh in on this.

740
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,391
Good. Then it's settled.

741
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,119
I'll get the art department
on a logo.

742
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,600
- Nice work.
- I had nothing to do with this.

743
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,558
Have a good weekend.

744
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,590
You have no problems with this?

745
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,354
Pete, we're in the same boat,
and I'm fine with it.

746
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,558
Trust me, that name
is a consolation prize.

747
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,711
It's a gravestone to our resistance.

748
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,712
You have no idea
what's going on out there.

749
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,553
This is not the same business anymore!

750
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,838
If you don't like it, maybe it's time to
get out of the business.

751
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,038
Dawn, could you get my wife on the phone?

752
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,953
What are you doing?

753
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,872
Working.

754
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,952
Give me that.

755
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,633
Hey.
