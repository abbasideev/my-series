1
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,551
So you haven't officially told anyone
you're looking to change your life?

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,393
Yes.

3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,359
But why put Doyle Dane into hysterics
when all I want to do...

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,390
is have what NASA calls
an exploratory mission with your agency?

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,392
Still, Timmy...

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,312
Don has some anxiety about...

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,960
well, obviously about Raymond.

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,193
Heinz Baked Beans has given us
national recognition...

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,714
and Raymond's a friend.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,395
I'm not used to telling people
what my account is worth.

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,996
Not just in billings, but in the prestige
that comes with ketchup.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,152
Don knows that, or he wouldn't be here.
He's not that polite.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,079
Just relax.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,992
If you do the work and I like it...

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,278
I guarantee that Raymond will fall in line.
I have that power.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,149
- And if you don't like our work?
- Raymond never has to know.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,993
I don't know if that solves my problem.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,549
Look, I understand your risk.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,472
Or we could have met in your office again.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,519
In fact, we can have
the presentation here too.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,512
No, we'll get a hotel.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,757
I, uh, am supposed to be meeting someone
in about 20 minutes...

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,275
and she likes me to wait for her.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,437
Well, take your time.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,113
And remember...

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,556
I don't need much of an excuse
to come to Manhattan.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,120
When I say a small team, I mean Stan.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,998
Just the three of us.

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,072
We bill it under Project K.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
Nice place.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,274
Well, it's available to you.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,512
You know, if you ever have
to spend the night in the city.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,398
I live here, Pete.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,711
It's been 7:00 for 20 minutes.
I'm starving.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,872
I'm sorry I'm late, but I have a job.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,156
You know what, Dawn?
You have another job-

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,833
which is being my maid of honor.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,515
Well, I can't lose that one, can I?

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,718
Well, I have some bad news.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,280
Al called me...

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,040
and he said both the caterer
and your date fell through.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,430
William? What happened?

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,591
Al doesn't think he's
ready to settle down.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,797
And he didn't want you
to spend the night defending yourself.

45
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,439
You tell Al to keep looking...

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,716
because I'm never gonna
meet someone at that office.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,952
- Al and I met at church.
- Church is impossible.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,350
You can't stand out
in that crowd of harlots.

49
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,193
You stand out.

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,396
You must run into somebody downtown.

51
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,598
I get on the train, and it's just us...

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,519
and then it gets thinner
and thinner until about 72nd.

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,916
Sometimes it's just me
and this old shoeshine.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,514
And he won't even look at me.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,035
Bea Carter says
her son Anthony ran into you.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,476
But that's what you don't understand.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,279
We were walking through the plaza...

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,869
and we passed each other
and we just nodded.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,670
Someone told me he said that,
but he didn't talk to me.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,152
And I didn't talk to him either.

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,872
Well, I'll keep looking.

62
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,394
That might be too much blush.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,598
If you look a little rusty,
it's 'cause I'm a little rusty.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,831
I need all the help I can get.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,355
The makeup's not the important part.

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,751
Mary Kay always says it's really about
making yourself feel better...

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,958
and that starts
with doing something for you.

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,838
Well, that'll be a first.

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,998
- Kate!
- Shh. I just put the baby down.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,075
- You have not changed.
- Well, you have.

71
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,913
How did you suddenly get younger than me?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
Because she's in the beauty business.

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,279
What do you think?

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,750
- How much did she spend?
- It's free.

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,594
This is my old stuff.
I'm a sales director now.

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,478
- How are your boys?
- Good.

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,153
- Did you see Kevin?
- She looked in.

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,755
Why don't we let him sleep
while we eat dinner?

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,360
I made a pork roast.

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,875
And I made reservations
at Le Cirque for two.

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,794
Well, I want to catch up.
And, more importantly...

82
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,952
Kate has a job interview tomorrow,
and I don't want her tying one on.

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,475
- Who are you meeting with?
- The competition.

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,160
- Can we take a rain check?
- Splendid.

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,671
She hasn't changed.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,475
Why are you getting on
an elevator going up?

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,075
Because the door opened
and you were standing there.

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,279
I pressed down.

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,834
Where have you been?
I missed you.

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,991
Working all the time. Don't tell anyone.

91
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,594
Like who?

92
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,109
Arnie's on call Thursday or Friday.

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,920
I'll leave a penny under the mat
when he's flown the coop.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,239
I have to go.

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,479
Can you be more specific?

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,274
Nope.

97
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,397
Good night.

98
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,758
Dennis must be doing well.

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,877
- That's from the company.
- My goodness.

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,872
What do you have to do to get this?

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,156
Just have a lot of my recruits
sell a lot of Mary Kay.

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,471
How much? Those are diamonds.

103
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,473
- Just has to be the most.
- They know what they're doing.

104
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,634
I know. They do. But there's no way
for me to move up there.

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,234
So is that why you're going to Avon?

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,232
There's women above me at Mary Kay.

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,950
It's just working out of Spokane,
there's only so far I can go.

108
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
Well, Joanie's a partner...

109
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,314
and I don't know if anyone would want
all that extra responsibility.

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,278
You should visit more often.
Turns out someone's proud of me.

111
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,397
I'm a monster.

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,039
Believe it or not...

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,034
"My daughter is a partner
at a Madison Avenue advertising firm"...

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,396
is something I enjoy saying.

115
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,994
It does sound pretty good.

116
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,631
Well, so much for keeping
my wits about me.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,076
I should be getting back to the Waldorf.

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,958
Well, I wish you
the best of luck tomorrow.

119
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,477
But if worse come to worse,
you're appreciated somewhere.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,720
What are the <i>Life</i> magazine
closing dates for Birds Eye?

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,759
Ken, it's Monday.

122
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,036
I got a perfect cup of coffee
and a Danish on the way.

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,952
You want to start with "Good morning?
How was your weekend?"

124
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,750
I spent it with my in-laws
listening to Ed complain...

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,275
about how much the world
hates Dow Chemical.

126
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,955
And I know that every gripe he has
is directed at me and this company.

127
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,192
Is it possible that this
has turned Ken Cosgrove into a neurotic?

128
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,317
If he wants people to stop hating him...

129
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,916
he should stop dropping
napalm on children.

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,473
I know you just came here to complain...

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,119
but I actually think that I can help you.

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,795
God, that's really true.

133
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,394
I just came in here to complain.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,437
How hard would it be to meet with Ed,
just you and me?

135
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,477
If I have a good reason?

136
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,029
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosgrove,
but it's the last one.

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
- Did you find your keys?
- I did.

138
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,592
Can you get Pierre Cossette on the line?

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,752
- I have an idea. Let's see what happens.
- Harry has great ideas.

140
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,355
I saw this thing on a spy show.

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,716
It's a clock with a tiny camera in it.

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,599
All we have to do is get it in there.

143
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,911
If you can get in, you don't need a clock.

144
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,476
I would guess it's a military account.

145
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,871
And I would guess they picked Stan
because he has no conscience.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,960
So Project K stands for what?

147
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,157
Project Kill Machine!

148
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,799
That's not what it stands for.

149
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,271
So what does it stand for, Bobby?

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,158
I don't know what it is.

151
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,152
Are you saying that because
you do know what it is?

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
No.

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,155
- Stan come through?
- Stan who?

154
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,438
I know one thing- he's not in a room
with tinfoil on the windows.

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,796
How are things, Don?

156
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,559
There's nothing in here.

157
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,359
- 'Cause you're gonna fill it with work.
- Mm.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,636
- If you don't fall asleep.
- Mm.

159
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,119
I'm telling you, it clears the cobwebs.

160
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
I think a hot dog
and a hamburger are too similar.

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,915
Plus, a hot dog cries out for mustard.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,550
No, I think a hot dog
cries out for ketchup.

163
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,316
A squiggly line.

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,671
Hmm.

165
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,877
I think we should order lunch.

166
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,513
Mmm. My goodness.

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,239
Someone's having a party
and didn't invite us.

168
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

169
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,678
Is Clara's birthday today?

170
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,753
It's tomorrow, and it's $2.00 a head.

171
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,433
And, actually, I don't know
what I'm going to get.

172
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,552
- Do you want to come?
- I can't.

173
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,552
Mr. Draper always needs me.

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,155
Could you punch me out when you leave?

175
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,072
Really?

176
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,352
How long are you going to be gone?

177
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,511
Well, if you punch me out-

178
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,912
Okay.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,231
I heard Mr. Draper's in there.

180
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,079
No.

181
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,715
- Did you get the pages?
- No.

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,638
Are you two rehearsing already?

183
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,274
Call me when you see them.

184
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,192
Arlene, are you sad it's not you?

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,033
You know Mel is my husband.

186
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,750
I could have him write you
into a hospital bed... or a grave.

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,594
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,634
What's going on?

189
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,794
Well, you're going to have
a love scene with Rod.

190
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,920
And between you, me and soon a national
audience, it's more of a love affair.

191
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,555
Oh, my goodness.

192
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,313
That's so exciting.

193
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,518
- Thank you for telling me.
- Oh, I did more than tell you.

194
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,310
Mel's been on the fence,
but I think he really believes in you.

195
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,039
Now, don't embarrass me.

196
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,554
You've done this before, haven't you?

197
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,718
Um, well, of course.

198
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,999
- Does a high school play count?
- No.

199
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,993
It's gonna be exciting at first,
and then it'll be part of the job.

200
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,549
It's pretty exciting.

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,475
The hard part is how James Garner there
will deal with it.

202
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,473
Some people think it's better to wait
till after it's happened...

203
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,837
or not tell them at all,
but I think it's best to be up front.

204
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,149
Well, obviously he's not going to like it.

205
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,311
Would you be upset if he did?

206
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,194
I don't know.

207
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,398
Why don't Mel and I
take you two out to dinner?

208
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,075
You know, to make him comfortable.

209
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,197
And, honestly,
all of us should be better acquainted.

210
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,159
I mean, Mel has big plans for you.

211
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,152
I'm gonna leave you alone with these.

212
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,760
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere?
- No, Meredith.

213
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,834
Well, it's just I can't find her or Mr. Crane,
and there's someone to see him.

214
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,633
I'm dying for you to meet Ken.

215
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,519
How are you?

216
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,319
Busy.

217
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,356
Have Scarlett see me when you find her.

218
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,558
Oh, good. You're home on time.

219
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,075
I am. It's only because
I have a lot of work...

220
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,391
and I don't want to do it
in a windowless room.

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,192
So, why don't you have a seat?
I'm gonna get you a drink.

222
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,273
And then I'm gonna
stuff you with coq au vin.

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,074
I know you're very busy...

224
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,393
but I want us to have- I don't know-

225
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,552
I want us to be able to talk
about things other than work.

226
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,279
Megan, what happened?

227
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,511
Just once I'd like to be that wife...

228
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,752
that lays a trap and has her husband
walk right into it.

229
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,596
Okay, first of all, Arlene-

230
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,152
You know, she plays Penelope Aldridge.
She basically owns Berkshire Falls.

231
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,473
She's married to Mel, the head writer,
and they want to have dinner with us.

232
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,914
Does it get worse?

233
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,310
Well, my story line
is getting more developed...

234
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,474
and that means I'm gonna have
a series of love scenes.

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,155
- With whom?
- With Rod Holly.

236
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,277
He plays Rafe Jackson.
He's Arlene's nephew.

237
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,431
Megan, I don't care.

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,955
What's a "love scene" consist of?

239
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,953
It's just kissing and hugging.

240
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,953
It's TV. We can't really do anything.

241
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,120
What am I supposed to say?

242
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,633
That you trust me
and that you know it's part of my job.

243
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,357
And maybe that it was bound to happen
if things went well.

244
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,318
Keep going.
I'm dying to hear what I say next.

245
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,357
Should I have hidden it from you?

246
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,277
I don't know, Megan.
I need to think about it.

247
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,513
Look, I know I wouldn't like it...

248
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,796
but I'd look on the bright side.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,789
Okay, I guess if I wasn't your husband,
I would be happy for you.

250
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,639
It does mean they like you.

251
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,960
Do you like me?

252
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,317
Honey, I can tolerate this,
but I can't encourage it.

253
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,519
You're perfect.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,118
Honestly, Ed, it's not just Ken
who's been losing sleep about this.

255
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,271
I mean, last week when half of Columbia
got into your lobby-

256
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,596
It was 15 people.

257
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,479
Look, you've been in
the news every other day.

258
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,598
A couple of articles placed in business journals
are not gonna make that stop.

259
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,752
They acted like they were
storming the Bastille.

260
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,354
This is their country too.

261
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,800
- What exactly is your point?
- Pierre.

262
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,639
A one-hour prime-time TV special
sponsored by Dow...

263
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,110
starring Joe Namath
and 15 or so of his best friends...

264
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,511
putting on a show drawing from America's
most beloved musicals.

265
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,990
<i>Broadway Joe on Broadway.</i>

266
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,230
Joe Namath sings?

267
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,880
Don't you want to watch it
just to find out?

268
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,798
And who are his friends?

269
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,951
I have access
to the greatest talent available.

270
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
There'll be sex appeal.
Joey Heatherton, for example.

271
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,150
Pipes, Julie Andrews and punch.

272
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,517
How about John Wayne
in a sketch version of <i>Camelot?</i>

273
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,435
We're mostly household products.
Women don't like football.

274
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,477
Have you ever asked them about Joe Namath?

275
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,153
Forget demographics.

276
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,233
How would you like Dow to be responsible
for making people smile?

277
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,231
And is there anything that makes people smile
more than Broadway and football?

278
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,152
"Yankee Doodle Dandy"
and the Notre Dame fight song...

279
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,993
playing at the same time.

280
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,754
<i>I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy</i>

281
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,036
<i>Yankee Doodle, do or die</i>

282
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,479
Okay, okay.

283
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,274
Kenny, did you tell them
I went to Notre Dame?

284
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,716
No, I told them about Joey Heatherton.

285
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,880
So it's tailor-made for us?

286
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,634
- What's our commitment?
- Well, you'd be a corner tenant.

287
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,712
There's six minutes
of commercials in the hour.

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,520
You'd get three and then
two 10-second billboards...

289
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,876
at the beginning and end of the show.

290
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,079
"Brought to you by Dow Chemical.
Family products for the American family."

291
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,950
Just imagine Joe Namath in a straw hat.

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,151
I'm sorry to bother you, Scarlett...

293
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,232
but is Mr. Crane in?

294
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,039
Okay.

295
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,760
No. He's in a meeting.
Is there something I can help you with?

296
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,277
Well, if he's expecting any special guests,
you should let us know.

297
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,477
Because he had someone come yesterday,
and you weren't here.

298
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,870
I must have been in the ladies' room.

299
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,920
No, and it's strange because
you didn't leave until 6:47.

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,117
Oh, Joan, it's Clara's birthday today...

301
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,476
and I tried to go at lunch,
but I got stuck at my desk.

302
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,839
So I left Mr. Crane on his own while I
attended to this company business.

303
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,873
We got her a Givenchy scarf from Gimbels.

304
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,600
I have the card here for you to sign.

305
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,394
But you never came back,
and you had Dawn punch your time card.

306
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,233
No, Dawn and I were working together.

307
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,232
But we were all over the place.

308
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,518
But mostly in Accounting.

309
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,990
Thank you for clearing that up.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,639
Dawn.

311
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,712
Have you spoken to Scarlett this morning?

312
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,599
We're missing the big hole punch, and I
think you were the last one to see her.

313
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,751
The hole punch is in the creative lounge.

314
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,514
Dawn, Scarlett told me everything.

315
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,194
Scarlett, you're fired.

316
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,838
Joan, please. It won't happen again.

317
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,752
Not here it won't. Go get your things.

318
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,631
<i>Dawn, could you get Stan in here
before the partners' meeting?</i>

319
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,552
I'll deal with you later.

320
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,351
Girls do it all the time.

321
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,557
Just go before you really
embarrass yourself.

322
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,509
I hope you realize this means
now you're on Ed's radar.

323
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,512
So will I be invited to Sunday dinner?

324
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,398
Something like that.

325
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,629
I don't know where you're going, but I
want you to bring back champagne.

326
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,031
Oh, Harry, I'm not coming back.

327
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,554
What are you talking about?

328
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,875
Joan, you owe Scarlett an apology.

329
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,917
Harry, please don't
involve yourself in this.

330
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,992
I'm tired of your petty dictatorship.

331
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,278
So whatever capital crime or treason
she committed, she's in my department.

332
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,670
I didn't realize you were
that attached to Scarlett.

333
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,400
- We're not attached.
- We are attached!

334
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,517
I have something more important to do.

335
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,592
I would hope you do too.

336
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,918
Scarlett, do whatever you think is best.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,640
You are to do whatever <i>I</i> think is best.

338
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,713
Let's go. Back to work.

339
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,797
Everything's fine.

340
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,676
I understand the confidentiality,
but I need to know how to bill Project K.

341
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,120
Don't.

342
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,998
Meredith, why don't you step out?

343
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,353
I don't know what she said because
I'm not privy to these conversations...

344
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,954
but I would like the chance
to defend myself.

345
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,236
- Mr. Crane, I haven't-
- No, please.

346
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,596
Let him go on.

347
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,992
Well, it's this simple- Scarlett works for me
and Joan tried to fire her.

348
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,197
She left work early
and had Dawn punch her time card.

349
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,957
It's pay for a minimum of five hours of work
that she didn't do that we are paying for.

350
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,952
Well, it's either me or her.

351
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,430
- Joan?
- Scarlett.

352
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,070
I think you mean, "If she goes, I go."

353
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,117
<i>Broadway Joe on Broadway.</i>

354
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,193
Is there anybody in here
who thought of that?

355
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,875
- I did.
- What the hell is that?

356
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,115
It's $150,000 worth of incremental business
I generated while solving a problem.

357
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,517
For what? So I can stand outside that glass
and watch you all in here?

358
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,796
- What did Dawn do?
- Well, I'm almost positive-

359
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,236
Just keep talking to her
because she's a partner.

360
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,760
You know what?

361
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,877
I'm sorry my accomplishments
happened in broad daylight...

362
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,395
and I can't be given the same rewards.

363
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,234
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You know damn well.

364
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,872
The next time this group is called to order,
I expect to be sitting at this table.

365
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,350
I've actually earned it.

366
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,471
Don't worry, dear.
That's not going to happen.

367
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,792
Joan, I don't want to put myself
in the same camp as Harry...

368
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,837
but I might remind you and everyone...

369
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,152
the Commission on Human Rights
is continuing to investigate our industry...

370
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,471
regarding the employment of Negroes.

371
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,552
She's a good secretary.

372
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,393
Of course.

373
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,312
What about Scarlett?

374
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,552
I think this humiliation will suffice.

375
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,393
Can we continue with the billings?

376
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,472
Yes.

377
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,074
Where were we?

378
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,869
"Meredith, why don't you step out?"

379
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,838
Well?

380
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,479
Oh.

381
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave.

382
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,714
I don't care, as long as you brought
those bridal magazines.

383
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,393
What is wrong with you?

384
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,836
I had a day today that pushed
your stupid wedding...

385
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,440
to the bottom of the list.

386
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,512
- Did you get fired?
- No.

387
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,398
I don't think so.

388
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,472
Who can tell at that place?

389
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,711
What happened?

390
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,271
One of the girls asked me to punch out
her time card, and we got caught.

391
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,317
I told you,
those girls aren't your friends.

392
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,596
Yes, they are.
She got in more trouble than me.

393
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,797
Why do you think she asked you?

394
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,997
You can't say no 'cause you're too scared.

395
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
All they see is, "Yes, sir."

396
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,120
Everybody's scared there.

397
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,635
Women crying in the ladies' room.

398
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,359
Men crying in the elevator.

399
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,909
It sounds like New Year's Eve
when they empty the garbage...

400
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,753
there are so many bottles.

401
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,072
And I told you about that poor man
hanging himself in his office.

402
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,836
Oh, they got it so bad,
they must all be jealous of you.

403
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,118
What am I gonna do?
Throw a brick through their window?

404
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,999
I want to keep my job,
so I'm gonna keep my head down.

405
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,958
Well, I couldn't do it.

406
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,431
Well, you don't have to.
You're getting married.

407
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,992
And dinner.

408
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,114
I should have brought Dennis.

409
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,396
You're not even listening to me.

410
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,076
I'm sorry. I need a drink,
and this place is a soda fountain.

411
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,959
I feel like I'm in high school,
right down to the clientele.

412
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,911
Hello?

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,913
We're sitting here waiting for a phone
to ring. This actually is high school.

414
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,794
- So what do you do to have fun?
- I don't look in a guidebook.

415
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,957
This wasn't in a guidebook, okay?

416
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,554
My friend told me about it.

417
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,553
Is she a nun
or just the right age for this place?

418
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,520
Apparently, there are
quite a few men here...

419
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,831
who go for a certain type.

420
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,070
Oh.

421
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,720
Joanie, don't judge me. I'm in New York.

422
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,633
Good evening, ladies.

423
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,473
If there's anything you need,
I'll be over there.

424
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,711
Catherine's got a lot of tables,
so don't hesitate.

425
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,915
I'm Leo.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,560
I'm Kate. And this is Joan.

427
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,272
Actually, I don't think
our phone is working.

428
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,512
- Can you test it?
- I'll see what I can do.

429
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,953
How many girls come in here and complain
that their phones are broken?

430
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,794
He's cute. Reminds me of Scotty.

431
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,396
Well, don't marry him.
That was the worst six months of my life.

432
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,278
You always did everything first.

433
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,670
But you did everything smart.

434
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,071
Well, tonight we are just
a couple of young secretaries.

435
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,953
Answer it.

436
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,230
Hello?

437
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,800
How did you do that?

438
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,439
I didn't do anything. He likes you.

439
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,671
What?

440
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,040
Oh.

441
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,157
Just a minute. Let me ask my girlfriend.

442
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,072
He wants us to meet him after his shift.

443
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,676
- Well, tell him you know a place.
- But I don't. Do you?

444
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,110
- Should I invite him to my room?
- No.

445
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,351
We're just trying to think of a place.

446
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,080
- Tell him to think of a place.
- Do you know of a place?

447
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,274
Oh, good.

448
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,273
- Hang up.
- Till then.

449
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,992
Okay, now I need a drink.

450
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,911
Do you honestly believe a few jokes
on the <i>Smothers Brothers...</i>

451
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,514
are really upsetting people?

452
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,637
I think it's the sponsors
and the network...

453
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,757
don't want to have
a conversation about the war.

454
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,958
I'd like to have an evening without
a conversation about the war.

455
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,512
Darling, you shouldn't smoke so much.
The weight you lose isn't worth the wrinkles.

456
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,796
See, I think the sponsors are for the war.

457
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,912
They don't want to have any dissent.

458
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,959
Don, you're a writer.
You know this is censorship.

459
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,351
I am a writer and I'm against the war, but-

460
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,719
When you buy a commercial,
you're hoping...

461
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,235
that the consumer is in a good mood
when they hear your message.

462
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,472
So if you agree on
a wholesome variety show...

463
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,635
and all of a sudden it's filled with satire-
the most threatening humor there is-

464
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,712
you're worried about people
hating what you're selling.

465
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,798
Megan, let's talk about you...

466
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,634
and how you found this man.

467
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,075
I could cast you, you know that.

468
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,471
Yes, I'm sure he's a man
who plays many roles.

469
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,115
Luckily, you don't have to worry
about censorship with the show...

470
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,635
because it's so tame.

471
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,996
Of course it's for daytime entertainment.

472
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,833
It's for housewives.

473
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,640
It has to be a little titillating.

474
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,677
We have our own standards.

475
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,672
Although they've been
very liberal with us.

476
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,758
But, you know...

477
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,039
when we do things on the show,
it's all very tasteful.

478
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,873
Well, it's not real life.

479
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,632
Why don't you let me get the check?

480
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,390
We go back to our pad,
smoke some grass and...

481
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,950
see what happens.

482
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,312
Sounds like fun.

483
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,312
I don't know. It's late.

484
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,880
It's not.

485
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,997
Look, if you don't smoke grass,
that's fine.

486
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,959
It's not everything we had in mind.

487
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,952
I'm not sure if I understand.

488
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,353
We like Megan.

489
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,477
And we like you.

490
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,274
And we'd like to be friends.

491
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,238
Us too.

492
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,077
Well, then, uh-

493
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,639
I guess it's not impossible,
under the right circumstances...

494
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,918
for us to... become better acquainted.

495
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,310
Hey, it may not work.
It's a chemistry experiment.

496
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,040
I have a big day tomorrow.
You both know that.

497
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,760
That's work. This is play.

498
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,439
I have to get up very early.

499
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,318
That's what black coffee's for.

500
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,119
I make it delicious.

501
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,793
Uh-

502
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,439
Maybe another time.

503
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,791
Arlene, we've heard "no" before.

504
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,315
I guess there's no reason to skip dessert.

505
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,954
What? This is the best seat.

506
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,396
St. Mark's
between Second and Third, please.

507
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,953
Have you been to the Electric Circus?

508
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,475
- All the time.
- We're from out of town.

509
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,352
Let's see who kisses better.

510
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,394
I'm not playing this game.

511
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,119
Because she'll lose.

512
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,751
What the hell was that?

513
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,595
What? They like you and they like me,
and they'd like us to be friends.

514
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,911
They were so out in the open.

515
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,514
It was a good strategy.

516
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,116
I kept thinking he was going to ask me
for a job directing commercials.

517
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,318
Maybe he was waiting for tomorrow morning
when we were basking in the afterglow.

518
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,110
- Don't.
- Just a pile of arms and legs.

519
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,954
I don't know whether
to laugh or be sick...

520
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,000
because now I think that's the reason
they gave me the scene.

521
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,437
I'm sure they've tried that with plenty
of people who haven't gotten scenes.

522
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,480
Don, I have to go back to work with them.

523
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,559
It'll be better than ever.
How long have they been married?

524
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,438
Eighteen years.

525
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,157
I'm busy.

526
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,436
Come up for air.

527
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,360
Oh, hey.

528
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,114
Would you mind?

529
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,117
This is my friend.

530
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,396
I'm Johnny.

531
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,319
Joan. Pleased to meet you.

532
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,596
Johnny and Joan.

533
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,912
Bonnie and Clyde.

534
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,320
- Do you want a drink?
- I have one.

535
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,992
<i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>

536
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,676
What'd I say?

537
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,439
Well, what did he say?

538
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,837
He said I'd want you.

539
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,438
<i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>

540
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,836
<i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>

541
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,037
Well, war or no war...

542
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,874
Nixon doesn't think he's
running against Johnson.

543
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,714
He thinks he's running
against the ghost of Kennedy.

544
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,314
So does Johnson.

545
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,238
I don't know where Helen is.

546
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,800
How are you both this morning?

547
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,270
Frankly, we're a little embarrassed.

548
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,036
Well, if that has anything to do with me,
I apologize. That was not my intention.

549
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,032
How are Jennifer, Bea and the twins?

550
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,679
It's Nathan and Steven, right?

551
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,955
Yes. Uh, they're well, thank you.

552
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,477
That display yesterday of-

553
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,150
well, of initiative
really caught our attention.

554
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,600
This is a check for $23,500.

555
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,320
That's the full commission
on <i>Broadway Joe.</i>

556
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,838
Well, thank you. That's a lot of money.

557
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,274
So, anything else to say?

558
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,797
I'm puzzled.
What do you make a year, Mr. Crane?

559
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,270
Twenty-two. So what about the partnership?

560
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,875
You want some of the spoils.
Well, there you go.

561
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,997
We have to get bigger
before we get bigger.

562
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,878
What a load of crap.

563
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,191
- You know, Joan's not even in yet.
- Leave her out of this.

564
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,557
Bert, you know how important
I am to this company. You were me.

565
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,152
I was different than you, Mr. Crane,
in every way.

566
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,759
- So you don't want the money?
- No, I've earned the money.

567
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,197
But I've also earned a partnership.

568
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,199
I really hope some other firm
doesn't figure that out first.

569
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,832
That was the most
impressive thing he's done.

570
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,230
Should we fire him
before he cashes that check?

571
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,072
<i>... New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy.</i>

572
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,279
- Aren't you gonna be late?
- Aren't you?

573
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,992
I love you.

574
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,594
Wish me luck.

575
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,152
Good luck.

576
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,430
I'm really waking you this time.

577
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,874
Kate.

578
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,920
Honey, wake up.

579
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,755
Now, you two layabouts have to bathe him.
I have an appointment.

580
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,559
Mom, I'm still going to work.

581
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,512
Do you need to throw up?

582
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,950
Mother, can you give us a minute?

583
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,558
Why did I do that?

584
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,075
You had some fun.

585
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,550
I just wanted to try it.

586
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,600
Now you'll go home and you'll find
everything right where it belongs.

587
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,794
I'm really not you, am I?

588
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,517
- Why would you want to be?
- Are you kidding?

589
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,637
Look what you did.

590
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,557
You came out here.

591
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,553
You staked this out on your own.

592
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,950
I always had Dennis to fall back on.

593
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,874
Even when I went to Mary Kay.

594
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,838
You didn't.

595
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,517
And I never will.

596
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,070
How'd that happen?

597
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,471
The whole reason I even talked to Avon...

598
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,119
is because I wanted-

599
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,838
I don't know- what you have.

600
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,877
It's not what you think.

601
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,078
- You're an executive.
- It's a title.

602
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,674
And money.

603
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,119
I've been working there for 15 years,
and they still treat me like a secretary.

604
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,510
What's it have to do with them?

605
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,557
You're there, Joan.

606
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,997
And from where I'm sitting,
it's damn impressive.

607
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,912
I don't care how they make you feel.

608
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,356
It's right in front of you for the taking.

609
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,190
I'll be back in an hour.

610
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,992
There you go.

611
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,151
Oh.

612
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,835
Okay, I'll draw the bath.

613
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,156
It's clean, it's simple...

614
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,072
and it's tantalizingly incomplete.

615
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,160
What's missing?

616
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,913
One thing.

617
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,554
"Pass the Heinz."

618
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,154
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.

619
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,597
It's Heinz. It only means one thing.

620
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,239
It feels like half an ad.

621
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,313
The greatest thing
you have working for you...

622
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,960
is not the photo you take
or the picture you paint.

623
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,157
It's the imagination of the consumer.

624
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,631
They have no budget.
They have no time limit.

625
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,270
And if you can get into that space,
your ad can run all day.

626
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,550
Well, Pete, you said I'd say it.

627
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,712
It's pretty bold work.
I think I still want to see our bottle.

628
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,077
- I thought that at first too, but-
- We will test it both ways.

629
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,272
It's a testament to ketchup
that there can be no confusion.

630
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,159
Let me chew on it, fellas.

631
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,197
You're going to be thinking
of ketchup all day...

632
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,033
and you didn't even see it.

633
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,955
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

634
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,396
Well, hello.

635
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,631
Hello.

636
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,196
Ted, you want to come in?

637
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,957
I hope you left us something.

638
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,957
Hey, how are you?

639
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,949
It's a bake-off? Since when?

640
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,837
- Come on, Don.
- Go wait by the elevator.

641
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,918
Peggy.

642
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,799
So, what's the difference
between ketchup and catsup?

643
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,238
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,
comes in a bigger bottle...

644
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,676
is cheaper, but tastes just like ketchup.

645
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,198
Now, we know that's not true...

646
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,158
but that's what
your competitors are saying.

647
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,038
Over and over.

648
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,433
And they're selling their watered-down,
flavorless sauce...

649
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,034
by pretending that they're you.

650
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,954
Makes you angry, doesn't it?

651
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,793
Me too.

652
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,600
But I always say...

653
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,672
if you don't like what they're saying...

654
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,353
change the conversation.

655
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,030
"Heinz. The only ketchup."

656
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,072
Imagine this 40 feet tall...
in Times Square.

657
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,600
Ketchup versus catsup-
end of conversation.

658
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,992
- Good morning.
- Good afternoon.

659
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,118
Thank you.

660
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,111
Joan, may I have a word?

661
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,114
I'm sorry I was not
more forthright with you.

662
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,232
I think it would only be fair
if you docked my pay...

663
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,312
to cover the hours Scarlett did not work.

664
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,710
Fair to whom? Scarlett?

665
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,952
I don't know. Fair to the company?

666
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,992
This is the key to the supply closet...

667
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,640
and this is the key to the time cards.

668
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,758
You will be responsible
for monitoring both.

669
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,479
What?

670
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,113
Okay.

671
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,195
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

672
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,636
You don't understand
that this is a punishment.

673
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,679
I don't care if everybody hates me here,
as long as you don't.

674
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,278
We'll see.

675
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,959
So there's two of us.

676
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,919
We're both the same size agency.

677
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,834
You're not afraid of
a little heads-up baseball.

678
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,276
I only did it because no one else
was supposed to know.

679
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,352
I think everything
should be done in secret.

680
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,717
Lock me in that Project K room,
I'll work on anything, Don.

681
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,190
I miss it already.

682
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,520
Mind if we join the Lonely Hearts Club?

683
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,517
Who says we're not celebrating?

684
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,354
J. Walter Thompson.
They bought it in the room.

685
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,116
Are you kidding me? We paid for that room.

686
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,874
What do you know?

687
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,270
The biggest agency in the world.

688
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,272
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

689
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,591
See, I just got off the phone
with Raymond Geiger...

690
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,239
and he said that you
were at the Roosevelt...

691
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,198
giving a presentation
to the ketchup brand manager.

692
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,760
But I said that was impossible...

693
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,594
because how could that happen
at my firm without me knowing?

694
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,558
Because no one was supposed to know.

695
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,718
Let me get a rye rocks and an Old Spanish.

696
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,792
I'm sorry, Ken. Damn it.

697
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,473
I'll call him. I'll work it out.

698
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't bother.
He doesn't even want to give us 90 days.

699
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,718
There's nothing better
than being known for your loyalty.

700
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,838
You hear that, Ted?

701
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,877
Vinegars, sauces and beans is available.

702
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,191
Help yourself. It's a gold mine.

703
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,033
They'd love that.

704
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,079
There's a pie,
and they slice it into pieces...

705
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,231
and they throw the tiniest piece
into the yard...

706
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,391
and let all the small agencies
fight over it.

707
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,631
Speak for yourself.

708
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,552
It was worth the risk.

709
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,474
I think I see a friend.

710
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,794
Please, Rafe, you have a family.

711
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,715
I have a family that ignores me,
that treats me like I've never been there.

712
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,316
But you, you make me feel new again.

713
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,517
I work for you.

714
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,592
And for her.

715
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,034
She's good to me.

716
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,318
Stop fighting. I don't know
how much longer I can take this.

717
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,279
This is your bed you share with her.

718
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,840
I can't.

719
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,591
Rafe, we can't.

720
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,593
Corinne, don't deny this,
what's between us.

721
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,434
Don't deny me when I know you feel it too.

722
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,796
I do.

723
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,240
Rafe.

724
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,789
You like to watch, do you?

725
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,078
Oh, Rafe.

726
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,674
And we're clear.

727
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,798
Everyone to the conservatory set.

728
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,951
- Very nice, everyone.
- You did great.

729
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,111
Thank you.

730
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,631
Megan, your agent's here.

731
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,033
That was steamy.

732
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,751
So I should go change, and we can go.

733
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,320
I'll keep you company.

734
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,713
What are you doing here?

735
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,439
Because you didn't want me to see that?

736
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,638
No, and I don't understand
why you'd do that to yourself.

737
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,519
It's a hell of a lot better
than letting my imagination run wild.

738
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,231
The first time you come to set
is for this?

739
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,880
I've been here for months.
What did you think was going to happen?

740
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,754
- I didn't expect you to enjoy it.
- It's acting, Don.

741
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,236
Were you gonna brush your teeth at least
before you came home?

742
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,631
I'm sick of tiptoeing around you every
time something good happens to me.

743
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,036
This is my job. No, my career.

744
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,192
You kiss people for money.
You know who does that?

745
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,876
You couldn't stop it,
so I guess ruining it was enough for you.

746
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,679
Would you rather have not known?

747
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,320
You never watch the show.
It'd be like it never happened.

748
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,955
Why don't you have dinner
with Arlene and Mel tonight?

749
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,032
They're much more open-minded.

750
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,952
That's been out there all day.

751
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,475
Was it going to be out there all night?

752
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,920
Yes.

753
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,119
- Take that off.
- Why?

754
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,998
It doesn't mean anything to you.

755
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,232
- It does to you.
- It does.

756
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,394
So what do you do when I leave here?

757
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,870
Get on your knees and pray for absolution?

758
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,073
I pray for you.

759
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,879
For me to come back?

760
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,200
No.

761
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,200
For you to find peace.
