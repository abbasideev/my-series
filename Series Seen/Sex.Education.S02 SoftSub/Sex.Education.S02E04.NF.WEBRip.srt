Oh, my God, yes!

- Yes.

No.

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,240
Shit.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,400

- Oh!

Yes, yes!

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
I win again.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You okay?

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
Yes.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,360
- What do you want to do now?
- Shall we kiss for a bit?

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,920
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,760
I've been thinking.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,080
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe we should...

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,920
Maybe we should go all the way.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Yeah?

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,360
It's kind of a big step.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,280
I think I'm ready.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Are you sure?

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,800
Yeah, I am.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
But if you're not ready...

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,920
No, I'm ready.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
Let's go all the way.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,280
Have you got a condom?

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
- Oh, you mean...
- What's wrong?

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
Ooh. I just didn't realize you meant,
like, right now.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,040
Well, yeah. Yeah. We just said
we wanted to do it, so I just...

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,960
I think we just need some time to prepare

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,360
because we only get our first time once
and we want it to be right.

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,320
How about tomorrow night?

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Okay.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
We're gonna have sex.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,480
We are gonna have sex.

Oh. You're all dressed up.

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
Something special after school?

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
No, it's just the shirt was clean, so...

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,840
- What are you doing?
- You missed a spot.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Mm.

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,960
- I've got to go.
- Would you like a lift?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
- Absolutely not.
- Smoothie?

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,160
No!

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,200
I think you need a new pan shelf.

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360
No, it's fine,

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
but thanks.

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,720
Do you think you could take
some stuff with you today?

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
What stuff?

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Your things.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,840
- Sure.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Things.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
And this. Every penny counts.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,360
The small pennies. So, I'm off.

57

Which one of these looks the smartest?

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
- Where are you going?
- I've got a job interview this afternoon.

61
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,440
PA at a swanky law firm.

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,160
What?

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,640
Nothing. It's good to aim high, Erin.

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,800
Can we cut the Erin shit? It's Mum.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
That one.

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,560
No, no, no, no, no, no!
These are important.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,560
Dickhead.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Don't call your sister a dickhead,
she's three.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Half sister.

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
- What are they for?
- None of your business.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
Hi, Cynthia.

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,760
- Thought you hated her?
- Yeah, she's a nosy cow but she's agreed

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
to look after Elsie later,
so smile and wave.

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
Mmm.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
Mmm.

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
Have a good day at school.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,520
- Oh, maybe we could hang out later.
- No, thanks.

78
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
"No, thanks."

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Ooh!

80
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,920
Hi, Adam.

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
Can we talk...

82
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,560
- about what happened?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes, you do.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
Ah...

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,840
- Do you want to ride to school together?
- Yeah, sure.

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Um...

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,200
For you to read next.
Did you finish Neruda?

89
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah! Yeah, I loved him.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,200
That guy has got such a way with words.

91
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,920
He's very poetic, isn't he?

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,560
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

93
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,040
It's just a bus.

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
It's just a bus.

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
On or off, love?

97
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,840
Actually, I'm gonna walk.

98
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,360
- Moordale Secondary's quite a trek.
- It's okay. I love walking.

99
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
See you later.

100
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,280
- Riding to school with Rahim, are we?
- No.

101
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,160
I was doing something else
and I ran into him.

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,480
Mm-hmm.

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,880
- Do I sense a hint of jealousy?
- What were you doing?

104
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
Nothing important.

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Why are you wearing your best shirt?

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
- Well...
- Uh-huh...

107
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,880
Ola and I...

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
- might be going all the way tonight.
- No.

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,000
No! You're gonna be deflowered?

110
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
Otis, you're gonna be deflowered!
Come on!

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Stop.

112
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,840
- Why are you not excited, man?
- I am. I am excited.

113
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,440
- I'm just nervous.
- Don't. Don't...

114
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,160
- Overthink. I know. I just...
- A-ha. Uh-huh.

115
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,040
Okay, you can't laugh.

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
I always...

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,480
kind of thought I'd be in love
with the person I lost my virginity to

118
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,920
and we haven't said that yet.

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,400
- You can laugh if you want.
- Yes!

120
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,040
No, I actually think it's nice.

121
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,200
- But you really like Ola, right?
- Yeah. I like her a lot.

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
And really liking someone
is pretty close to love, isn't it?

123
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,880
Yeah, I guess so.

124
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,520
But also, you don't have to do it
if you're not ready.

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
I am ready. I'm ready.

126
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,200
- I am ready.
- You're ready?

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,960
- I really like Ola.
- Uh-huh.

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
- She really likes me.
- A-ha.

129
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,280
- We are going to have sex tonight.
- You're going to have sex tonight!

130
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Can you calm down?

131
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,400
If I think about my clitoris
really, really hard, I can come.

132
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,880
Seventeen times a day is quite excessive.

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,840
I know.

134
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
I want to experiment with role play

135
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,776
but he's only just become comfortable
with dirty talk, so how soon is too soon?

136
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
You won't know unless you ask.

137
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,880
You always need to wash your penis.

138
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,600
- Always?
- Always.

139
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,440
"If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine,

140
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,960
the gentle fine is this. My lips...

141
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,320
two blushing pilgrims ready stand
to smooth that rough touch

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
with a tender kiss."

143
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,520
"Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
which mannerly devotion shows in this;
for saints have..."

145
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,240
Stop. Florence, this is a play
about horny teenagers.

146
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,520
I don't believe you want to have sex
with him at all.

147
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,920
And, Jackson, you're a terrible actor.

148
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,016
I don't think
you're supposed to talk to us like that.

149
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
I'm not a teacher.

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,000
Oi, Romeo. Show us your tights!

151
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah, I borrowed your dad's.

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,760
Juliet is a role of a lifetime for me,
so you better learn your lines.

153
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,480
This isn't a joke to everyone.

154
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
All right.

155
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
Okay.

156
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,800
I have no idea why they gave him the part.
He's terrible.

157
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,840
He's Jackson Marchetti.
Who cares if he can't act?

158
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,016
And I heard since he broke up with Maeve,
he'll basically have sex with anyone.

159
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,560
- Oh, he's not really my type.
- No one's ever your type.

160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
- You're so picky, Florence.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,520
The shade is called "Lustering."

162
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Oh, it's just gorgeous.

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,920
- I'll write it down.
- No, um...

164
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,880
- You can keep it.
- Oh.

165
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,320
That's very kind. Thank you.

166
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
Are you sure there wasn't anything else
you wanted to talk to me about?

167
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,480
This is a safe space.

168
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
Well...

169
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,880
Sometimes I feel like
my life is moving by so quickly.

170
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
I can't help thinking,

171
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,440
"Am I really going to die
sleeping next to a man...

172
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,840
...who hasn't touched me...

173
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
properly...

174
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
in nearly six years?"

175
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
It is a dilemma that many couples face.

176
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,840
It is possible to reignite passion.

177
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
What would you suggest?

178
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Well, can you...

179
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,120
start by telling me
a bit about your relationship?

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,280
Do you have condoms?
I didn't bring any, which was stupid.

181
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,520
I can go home and get some or ask my mum.

182
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Mm. Don't ask your mum.

183
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, yeah. That's...

184
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,000
- It's okay. I'll get some.
- ...a bit weird.

185
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
- Hey, arsehat.
- Hey.

186
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,760
Hi. Sorry to interrupt,
it's just clinic stuff.

187
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Cool.

188
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,200
See you tonight.

189
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey! Okay.

190
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,440
What's happening tonight?

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,680
Nothing unusual.

192
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,720
We're just hanging out. You know,

193
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,960
- boyfriend, girlfriend, hang times.
- Cool.

194
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,360
You've got a 3:45 appointment.

195
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Uh... Ooh. Uh...

196
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
- I'm not sure.
- Otis.

197
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,600
Your mum has taken all our clients.
Please just be there.

198
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Piss off, Erin.

199
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
Who's Erin?

200
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
My mum. She's been staying with me.

201
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, that's a big deal.

202
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,360
Why didn't you say anything?

203
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,880
We don't really hang out anymore, Otis,
you're always with your girlfriend.

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Well, you could have told me.

205
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
It's fine.
Don't be late for the appointment.

206
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,760
- I need your help.
- I'm cramming here, Jackson.

207
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,280
But I've started rehearsals
and apparently, I'm bad at acting.

208
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,080
Hey. I need you to explain it to me
like you did for the audition.

209
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,640
That was a onetime thing.

210
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm here to help you
with English or maths,

211
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
not turn you into Olivier.

212
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,240
Who's Olivier? I'm playing Romeo.

213
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,160
- Can I meet you later?
- No,

214
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,736
because I'm chairing that algebra group

215
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
and then I have to write a letter
to my Polynesian pen pals.

216
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,400
Other people do have lives too. Sorry.

217
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,280
- Hey, heats start in 20, right?
- Yes, they do start in 20.

218
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,920
- Right, see you in a bit, Bev.
- See you in a bit, Dex.

219
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Did he just call you "Bev"?

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,440
That's Dex, he's on the quiz team.

221
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Vivian Odusanya has a crush.

222
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,480
No, I don't. That was normal.

223
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,640
Mm.

224
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
- I am late.
- Hey.

225
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Let's make a deal.
I'll help you get that weird guy

226
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,520
- if you help me with Shakespeare.
- No, thanks.

227
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,760
Come on. I can't humiliate myself
in front of the whole school.

228
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
Bev! Viv!

229
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,440
I've been trying to call you.

230
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,480
Apparently, the queen of the caravan park
has had to take Jonathan to the vets,

231
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,040
so I need someone to look after Elsie.
I am late for my interview.

232
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,520
- I can't.
- Please, please, Frogface.

233
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,880
If I get this job,
I can get us a proper flat.

234
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,040
A new start for you, for me, for Els.

235
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
- Fine.
- You are a gem.

236
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
- Okay.
- She's going to drop off any minute.

237
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Christ.

238
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,720
She's gonna get us disqualified.

239
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,720
Look how smug Let's Get Quizzy are.
Makes me sick.

240
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
- Hey.
- Hi.

241
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Nice bow tie.

242
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,000
- Who's that?
- That's Elsie, she's my sister. Sort of.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,320
She's mainly a dickhead.

244
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
Your mum's back and you have a sister.

245
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,120
Yeah, I'm late for the quiz heats.
Could you take her with you

246
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,360
to your appointment?

247
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,840
I won't be long, and she'll stay asleep
and you can forget she's even there.

248
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,800
I don't really know how
to look after a child. Um...

249
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Please.

250
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,920
Fine. Yeah.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked you.
It's fine.

252
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,680
Um... Yeah, I'll find someone else.

253
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
Uh, wait. Um...

254
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
I could...

255
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
I can take her, yeah. I think.

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,360
- Yeah?
- It'll be fine, right?

257
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

258
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay. Great, thank you. Thanks.

259
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,240
That's all right. Um, good luck.

260
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay, Miss Sands,
we'll have to give the place

261
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,520
to Let's Get Quizzy by default if...

262
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Question number one...

263
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
You dumb dog.

264
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,600
Hi. You're new.

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,480
I work here too. I'm Ola.

266
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Oh.

267
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,440
- Do you want to buy something?
- Yeah.

268
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,080
Uh, packet of condoms, please.

269
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,520
Didn't you used to go to my school?

270
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
I've just started,
so I think I just missed you.

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
Do you know Otis and Eric?

272
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
Not really.

273
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,440
- Hi, Ola.
- Hey.

274
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
- Is he a friend?
- Yeah, sort of.

275
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,400
He's kind of dating Eric.
They're so cute together, it's ridiculous.

276
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
Anyway, it was nice to meet you, Adam.

277
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I'll see you on my next shift. Cheers.

278
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,880
What are you looking at?

279
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Hello?

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,960
Hi, Jeanie.

281
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
- Remi?
- Yeah, um...

282
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,160
Spare key's in the, uh...

283
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,200
in the flower pot by the door.
I hope you don't mind.

284
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I didn't know you were in the country.

285
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
Last-minute book tour?

286
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,240
Eh, no, just, uh... Just here to see Otis.

287
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,480
- I had a few days off, so...
- He's not here.

288
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,240
- You could have called, Remi.
- Well, you know me, uh...

289
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,720
Mr. Spontaneous.

290
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,720
- How have you been, Jeanie?
- You know I hate it when you call me that.

291
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
Dr. Milburn.

292
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
I hope you like trout.

293
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,360
This is Jakob, my...

294
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,920
Boyfriend.

295
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,440
And this is Remi, my...

296
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Ex-husband.

297
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Great.

298
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
Now we've all met.

299
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,440
I don't want to impose.

300
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,600
I'll head to the hotel
and see Otis in the morning...

301
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,240
Would you like to stay for dinner?

302
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
Oh, that's lovely. Thank you.

303
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,200
I need a drink.

304
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>Next question.</i>

305
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
What is the largest moon of Saturn?

306
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
Oh, I think it's Phobos.

307
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
I think maybe Mimas.

308
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,560
- Titan.
- Correct.

309
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,320
- Yes!
- Next question.

310
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,360
Ascorbic acid is a form of which vitamin?

311
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
- C.
- Correct.

312
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,520
- Yeah!
- Quite the one-woman team

313
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,040
you've got there, guys. Next question.

314
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,680
What is the name
of the highest mountain in Wales?

315
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,120
Why do you have a kid again?

316
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,080
Um... Long story.

317
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,920
Come, sit. My office.

318
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,120
So, tell me what the problem is.

319
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
You've probably heard,
I'm playing Juliet in the school play.

320
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,200
Uh, congratulations.

321
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,400
Anyway, I thought it was a play about love
but apparently, it's all about sex.

322
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
And now, the whole cast
seem to be thinking about sex

323
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,840
every second of every day.

324
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,280
So... you're not ready to have sex

325
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,896
but you're feeling pressure
from your peers to keep up with them.

326
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't want to have sex.

327
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,920
But sometimes I think I should just do it,

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,640
so everyone'll shut up
and stop making me feel like a freak.

329
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Well, try not to think about
what other people are doing.

330
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,000
Run your own race,
and when you meet the right person,

331
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sure you'll be ready.

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
You're worried these concerns
might affect your performance.

333
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm the best actor in this school.

334
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm basically Meryl Streep but young...

335
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
and Scottish.

336
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,320
I hope that helped and if you want
to talk some more about this,

337
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,840
then I'll be here.

338
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,840
Thanks for that.

339
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,600
Okay.

340
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
Be there ASAP.

341
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,360
Okay.

342
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Elsie.

343
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Oh, shit.

344
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Elsie?

345
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Elsie?

346
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Shit!

347
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,200
Final question.

348
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,640
Which country, with a land mass
of 9.6 million square kilometers,

349
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,040
has just one time zone?

350
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,520
- I think it's China.
- I think maybe...

351
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,680
Russia?

352
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,480
Incorrect.

353
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,160
Let's Get Quizzy,
it's yours for the taking.

354
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
Canada?

355
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,360
Incorrect. The answer is China.

356
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,920
The Moordale Quiz Heads have won it...

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,120
...by a hair with 68 points.

358
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,680
Whoo!

359
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,080
Congratulations.

360
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,840
Miss Sands,

361
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,360
we don't want Maeve on our team.

362
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,600
She doesn't know how to collaborate
as a group and we nearly lost.

363
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But we won.

364
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,360
Yeah, but we almost didn't, Maeve.

365
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Look, I need this for my school CV.

366
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,400
Is this is how you feel too, Steve?

367
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Um...

368
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,920
- Yeah.
- Nice.

369
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
It's fine. I didn't want to be on
your stupid quiz team anyway.

370
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Maeve...

371
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,560
Maeve.

372
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,480
- Where's Elsie?
- I don't know.

373
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,080
She was right here.
Then I sent a text, and she disappeared.

374
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,000
- Are you joking?
- No, I told you I can't look after kids.

375
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,440
Oh, sorry. Am I keeping you
from something really important?

376
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
Go then, piss off.

377
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,360
Maeve.

378
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,680
- Maeve!
- I'm going to look for my sister

379
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,960
that you lost.

380
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,200
Okay.

381
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm coming, Maeve. I'm coming.

382
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,000
Hey, let's be logical, Maeve.
Like, where's a three-year-old gonna go?

383
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,160
Fuck being logical!
There's a child missing, she could be hurt

384
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,296
- or someone could have taken her.
- Why are you yelling?

385
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
Because everyone always lets me down.

386
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Sorry.

387
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,960
Go, go, go, go!

388
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Elsie, no!

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
Give it here. Jesus Christ.

390
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh.

391
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Right.

392
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,400
- Told you she's a dickhead.
- Yeah, she's kinda cute, though.

393
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Uh...

394
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Um...

395
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,520
Did you guys...
Did you make it through the heat?

396
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
Yep... but I got kicked out.

397
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,760
'Cause I mess everything up.

398
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,880
You don't mess everything up.

399
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,720
Anyway, that's their loss.

400
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,880
I've gotta go. I'm seeing Ola and...

401
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,480
I am really sorry
about losing Elsie. There's...

402
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,200
Yeah, you're a really shit babysitter.

403
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
Yeah.

404
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,720
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

405
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,800
I messed it up with you.

406
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
What?

407
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,280
There was this moment last term,
where I thought maybe you liked me...

408
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,360
and I liked you back.

409
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,840
Um, and I got scared,
so I didn't tell you how I felt.

410
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,040
And then you met Ola.

411
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
It's really hard seeing you
with her every day.

412
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
Why are you telling me this now?

413
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Because it's true.

414
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
Why do you look angry?

415
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Because, Maeve, you can't...

416
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,120
That's not fair.

417
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,560
I liked you. I really liked you.

418
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,720
I fucking turned myself inside out
liking you.

419
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,640
- You did like me?
- Yes.

420
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Of course I did.

421
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,560
- And now you're saying you felt the same.
- Yeah, it's... I was confused.

422
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,120
I have a girlfriend. I...

423
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,680
I made myself get over you, Maeve,

424
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,720
and now everything's fine,
everything's normal, everything's great.

425
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,880
I've gotta go.

426
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,360
Bad.

427
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Yeah,

428
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
that was bad.

429
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,200
It was not 14 times.

430
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,200
Over the course of two years
postgrad together,

431
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,600
I had to ask her out 14 times.

432
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,240
And she was wildly untameable.

433
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,800
- Yes, I was.
- She still is.

434
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
Hmm.

435
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,760
So, um, how did you two meet?

436
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,360
Jakob did some work on my house.

437
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,720
Oh, so... so you're an architect?

438
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm a plumber.

439
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Right, right. Well, honorable work,
yeah, yeah.

440
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,920
Jakob has his own company.

441
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh?

442
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
You know what?

443
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
- I think I'm going to go home.
- No, don't leave.

444
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I have an early morning.
Lots of toilets to fix.

445
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,720
- Yeah.
- It's early. We haven't eaten yet.

446
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll eat at home.

447
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,560
Leave you guys some space
to catch up about Otis.

448
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,040
- Nice to meet you.
- And you too, Jack... Jakob.

449
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,320
Catch you later.

450
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,520
What?

451
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,040
Your smugness is palpable.

452
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,760
Look, he seems very nice.

453
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,360
A practical man with big hands.

454
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,760
I'm content.

455
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,160
Yes, yes.

456
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,560
I can see that
and I am very happy for you.

457
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,960
You're always so suspicious.

458
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,800
I-I am not here to disrupt your life.
I just want to spend

459
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,280
a little bit of time with our boy.

460
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,000
Our "boy" is almost a man, Remi.

461
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,720
- Lovely, look at that. Yeah.
- No.

462
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,480
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, go on. Just a tickle.

463
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,400
- No.
- For old time's sake.

464
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,640
A little bit, just a little bit.

465
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
- Mm. Okay.
- Uh-huh.

466
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Mm.

467
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,640
Oh, no, I gotta get this button.
Can you see it?

468
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Yeah, I can. Wait, stay still.

469
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
Oh, jeez.

470
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,680
Fucking...

471
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
Oh, jeez.

472
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
- I've got this.
- Okay?

473
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,720
Yeah, I'm fine. How does this work?

474
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,880
Is it... Sorry. This is... tricky.

475
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,520
Fuck.

476
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,920
Why? Why isn't that working?

477
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Oh...

478
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,000
Are you sure you're okay?

479
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
You seem a bit off.

480
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,320
I mean, is it hot in here?
Maybe it's the candles.

481
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,120
That was supposed to be romantic.

482
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,720
Hey, no, it's... I like them.

483
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm just...

484
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,280
- hot.
- Well, maybe this doesn't feel right.

485
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,920
We don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

486
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Hey, I do.

487
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,840
Sorry. Sorry.

488
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,880
- Are you kidding me?
- Sorry.

489
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
Who was it from?

490
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
My mum.

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Ola, please, no.

492
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,600
"I'm sorry. I feel like an idiot."

493
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,720
It's clinic stuff.

494
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,960
Is there something going on
between you and Maeve?

495
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,600
Yeah. No! There's not. I just...

496
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
It... We are friends.

497
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,600
We're just friends.

498
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,720
I don't think I want to do this tonight.

499
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
- Just go.
- Okay.

500
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,760
- I got the job.
- Where have you been?

502
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,000
I picked up some things for the house
on the way home.

503
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,160
You said you were going to be home
two hours ago.

504
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,840
I went to an NA meeting as well.

505
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,840
- Great, why didn't you say that before?
- I wasn't aware I was under investigation.

506
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,640
I tried to do a nice thing
and you throw it in my face.

507
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,640
How do you think that makes me feel?

508
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,856
I don't really care how it makes you feel,
to be honest.

509
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,016
If you say you'll be home
at a certain time, just be here.

510
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,680
It's not my job to look after your kid.

511
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,360
How long are you going to punish me for...

512
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm here, aren't I?

513
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,160
Yeah... but I'm just waiting
for you to flake on me again.

514
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,520
I don't mind being on my own.

515
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,160
Okay? I can look after myself.

516
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,600
I don't want to look after you too.

517
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,520
- You won't have to this time.
- Yeah, whatever.

518
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,160
You make them like I used to,
with the faces.

519
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Help yourself.

520
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
I was supposed to read that in school.
I never did.

521
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,920
Why?

522
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,480
I was probably in the back
of some boy's car,

523
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,240
or smoking in a bush.

524
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,240
- Maybe I should give it another go.
- Maybe you should.

525
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
Don't put your boots on the sofa.

526
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,160
<i>- This is really something.
- Just a few notes that I'm making.</i>

527
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,600
No, Jean. This should be a book.

528
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,920
Exposing what teenagers get up to
behind closed doors.

529
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,040
Yeah, it could be revolutionary.

530
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Well...

531
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,760
You always came up with
the most original ideas.

532
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,000
- Who are you?
- Yes.

533
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,400
- Wait, say that again.
- Original ideas.

534
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,440
You just never had any...

535
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,840
self-belief.

536
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,360
Oh, my self-belief was just fine,
thank you very much.

537
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,240
You've changed.

538
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,480
And you... are still...

539
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,080
an entitled prick.

540
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Shit! That's Otis. Shit!

541
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Hey.

542
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,680
- Dad. Um...
- Come here.

543
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,800
Wait, what? When did you get here?

544
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,160
- Flew in this morning.
- Cool.

545
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Are you... Have you got, like, a tour?

546
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,520
No, I've come to see you.

547
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,800
I thought we could hang out together,
do some father-son bonding.

548
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Yeah, cool.

549
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,800
Are you taller?

550
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Ah...

551
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440

Are you coming to bed?

567
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Mm-hmm.

568
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,760
I thought we could spend
some time together tonight.

569
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,480
Maybe we could even...

570
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Or...

571
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,480
we could just hug for a bit if...

572
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,360
Come on, Maureen,

573
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,200
we're not 23 anymore.

574
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,960
You should probably take that off.

575

Okay.

580
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,880
This is how I die.

581
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,480
Oi! What do you think you're doing?

582
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Look...

583
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,880
- No!
- Help. Get off me!

584
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,640
- Help!
- What in the name of God is going on?

585
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,000
I was very cold, I asked him to help.

586
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,560
I saw someone stealing your gas canister,
so I came over.

587
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,640
I'm so sorry, Cynthia. I was just so cold.

588
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,160
Oh, love, don't you dare apologize.

589
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,480
There's a spare canister there,
you can have that.

590
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Help him, Jeffrey.

591
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,200
And you... should be ashamed of yourself.

592
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Cheers, Jeff.

593
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Cheers, mate.

594
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,360
Sucker.

595
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Uh...

596
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
What is this place?

597
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,520
Do you want to see something cool?

598
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,520
Thank you.

599
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,080
Ah...

600
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Well, I got kicked out, didn't I?

612
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,960
But... better than being back home.

613
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Did you have to do
those serious drill things?

614
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Show me.

615
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
I've forgotten it. No, I haven't. Here.

616
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,480
Wow.

617
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,600
I know you hate it at home, but...

618
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm kind of glad you're back.

619
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,160
It's nearly morning. We should get going.

620
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm glad I'm back too.

621
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,800
This was, um...

622
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
strange.

623
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Okay.

624
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Bye.

625
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Bye.

626
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,320
You're still here.

627
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,280
- Oh, I've gotta go.
- Okay.

628
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Um...

629
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Cool.

630
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,880
Hiding from your boyfriend?

631
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,120
He's being such a dick.

632
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
Eyelash.

633
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Make a wish.

634
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,400
You can talk to me
about anything, you know.

635
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,200
Even if you just want to be distracted.

636
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,120
I could speak Gamma Velorum to you.

637
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,000
That meant, "I made you something."

638
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Oh.

639
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,360
Oh, my goodness.

640
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,160
This is so cool.

641
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,840
Thank you.

642
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,680
I mean, there's no real secret to it,
it's just practice and practice.

643
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,760
Hey, Bev. You've got a little something
on your face there.

644
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,360
Thanks.

645
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,720
It's avocado. I like it on toast.

646
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,600
Anyway, the real secret is,
you've gotta know...

647
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,040
...I know,
definitely don't do that.

648
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,680
People pee in the sea all the time.

649
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,256
- Jackson.
- I mean...

650
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,600
Psst... Jackson...

651
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,800
Two secs.

652
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,920
- You all right?
- I'll teach you

653
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,800
- how to deliver a soliloquy...
- Oh.

654
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,520
...if you teach me how
to get jiggy with Dex.

655
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,040
- Did you just say "get jiggy"?
- It sounded better in my head.

656
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,360
Just... Just help me make him my, um...

657
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,240
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

658
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,680
- All right, deal.
- Deal.

659
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,000
I told you, he'll have sex with anyone.

660
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,440
You better be quick, Flo.

661
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,160
I don't wanna have sex.

662
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,480
Okay.

663
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,760
Do you want to have a seat?

664
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,200
Not having sex is a valid choice.

665
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,280
- And you shouldn't have sex unless you...
- No.

666
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,840
I don't want to have sex at all.

667
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,200
Ever, with anyone.

668
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,880
I think I might be broken.

669
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
Okay.

670
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,920
Why don't you start
by telling me how you feel

671
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,520
when you think about having sex?

672
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,920
I don't feel anything.

673
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,560
I have no connection to it.

674
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,720
It's sort of like...

675
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,520
I'm surrounded by a huge feast with
everything I could want to eat, but...

676
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,880
I'm not hungry.

677
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
Mmm.

678
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,560
Do you know what asexuality is?

679
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,880
It's when someone
has no sexual attraction

680
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,720
to any sex or gender.

681
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,000
Sex just...

682
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,480
doesn't do it for some people.

683
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh. But I still want to fall in love.

684
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,400
Well, some asexual people
still want romantic relationships

685
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,200
but they don't want the sex bit.

686
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,240
And others don't want either.

687
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,680
You know, sexuality is fluid.

688
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,840
Sex doesn't make us whole.

689
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,480
And so,

690
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,960
how could you ever be broken?

691
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,040
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

692
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,120
She is so much better than sex kid.

693
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,040
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Amazing.

694
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,560
Yeah, your advice was a bit crap
but your mum is my hero,

695
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,240
so I need a refund.

696
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,360
Uh...

697
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,040
- Hey.
- Hi.

698
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,400
Um...

699
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,680
I'm really sorry about last night.
That was...

700
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,080
Look, I've decided that I don't want you
to see Maeve anymore.

701
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,240
If you want to be my boyfriend,

702
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,800
then you have to talk to her and tell her
that you can't be friends with her.

703
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
Um... Wait.

704
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,160
Hey.

705
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Hey.

706
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,880
Um, I've got, um, music.

707
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,560
I've been missing you.

708
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,800
- But I only saw you yesterday.
- Yeah.

709
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,760
But it felt so long.

710
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeah, and I missed you too.

711
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,880
I was...

712
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,960
thinking that maybe
you want to be my boyfriend.

713
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,320
Um...

714
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,040
Uh...

715
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,400
No pressure, okay?

716
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
