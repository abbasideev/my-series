- Oh!

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Uh...

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,120
Did I do something wrong?

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
No.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,840
It's not you, it's me.
I have something called vaginismus.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,600
My vagina's like a Venus flytrap.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,800
If it makes you feel any better,
I've got one hairy nipple.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,800
Can you cure it, the vaginismus?

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
Apparently, if I'm patient,

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,320
I'll eventually be able
to get the big one in,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,240
but for now,
I can just get little Thumbelina up there.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,560
Do you know why you have it?

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,840
I think it's because
I put too much pressure on myself.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,320
So, you can't even wank then?

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,520
No, I do. I do.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,480
I just keep to the outside.

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,680
For some reason,
if I'm touching myself, then I'm okay.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
I have an idea.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I'm coming!

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,360
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,880
Good morning.

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Good morning.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,520
You know, Dad's still in the UK.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
He's on his book tour.

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,080
Can we talk about this, please?

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,400
Are you going to admit that you lied?

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,720
Then I guess
we have nothing to talk about.

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Withholding of information
is not technically a lie.

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,680
And implementing an avoidance strategy

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,280
will only suppress your negative emotions
towards me, not make them dissipate.

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,800
Oh, you're going to therapize me.
Go ahead.

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Have a seat.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
Show me your skills.

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm all ears.

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,600
I think your overreaction
to this situation

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,080
stems from your deep-rooted fear
of rejection.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,440
You've rejected Jakob,
now you're rejecting me.

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,640
You didn't exactly accept Jakob.

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,040
In fact, you made it
incredibly difficult for us.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,000
So, is your son's inability to form
an attachment with your ex-boyfriend

45
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,240
the real reason you're so angry?

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
No.

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,520
I'm angry because my son is involved in
a highly unethical underground operation

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,320
on school campus.

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,920
And he is refusing to take ownership
for the severity of his actions.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Fine. Okay, yes,
I spoke to people at school.

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,480
I gave out some advice.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
You can't arrest me for talking to people.

53
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,480
You don't invoice
for a casual conversation.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,240
It's wrong, Otis.

55
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,040
Well, I don't think it is.

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,640
I don't understand, Mum.

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
We usually just talk these things through
and everything's fine.

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,400
Why are you still so upset with me?

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Because I thought
I was raising you to be a man

60
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,120
who took responsibility for his actions.

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,920
And because,
as the primary carer in your life,

62
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,240
I always get your worst.

63
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
And I'm tired of it.

64
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,400
It's not my fault Dad left.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,640
You're going to be late.

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,400
Are you still coming
to see Eric's play tonight?

67
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm not exactly welcome on campus
at the minute.

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,640
You shouldn't let them bully you.

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,560
Oh. Ow.

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,920
Oh, I've packed some clean clothes
and a couple of dinners for your father.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,520
Would you drop them over at school?
Please?

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,760
For me.

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
- Did you tell him about me getting fired?
- No.

74
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,520
But someone probably will.

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
Might be best to mention it.

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,680
You'll find something
you're really good at soon.

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,480
No. No, no, no, no.

78
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,800
Oh, oh, okay. No, no, no, no. Not today.
Not today.

79
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,360
Okay?

80
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,520
- Where have you been?
- I was outside having a fag.

81
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,056
Okay, well, you can't leave her on her own
because she's three.

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,720
Ugh, she's fine.

83
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
Oh, my God. There you go.

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,840
Actually, I need you to take her
after school.

85
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,200
I've got a job interview.

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,320
Well, I can't, can I?
I've got the NSQC finals.

87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,760
- I thought you were coming.
- Oh, shit. I totally forgot.

88
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,760
I can't make it. Will they video it?

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,360
Yeah, it's on telly.
That's the whole point.

90
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,000
It's fine. Um, it's stupid anyway.
I'll take her to Cynthia's.

91
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,480
Everything's dirty.
Why haven't you washed her clothes?

92
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Just put her in her fairy costume.

93
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,040
Okay, fairy costume! Yeah! Here we go.

94
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
Well done. That's it.

95
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,640
Well, don't you look fancy.

97
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,160
Come on then.

98
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,120
- Be good.
- She reminds me of you as a kid.

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,760
Always making trouble.

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,000
- Why am I in trouble?
- You're not in trouble, Jeffrey.

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,800
I said Maeve used to cause trouble
when she was little.

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,560
You pissed on our doorstep once.

103
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Sorry.

104
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,400
Well, your mum was never around
to look after you, was she?

105
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,040
But that's all changed now, hasn't it?
Thank God.

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Bye, Els.

108
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,480
You need to de-wax your ears, Jeffrey.

109
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,720
Twat.

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,640
Isaac, Body Slammer's here.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think my mum is using again.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,040
Don't say I told you so.

113
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,520
I wouldn't dream of it.

114
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,240
I need you to do me a favor.

115
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,280
- When will I see you play this?
- Oh, well,

117
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
if you come to the musical tonight,
I'm in the band.

118
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,160
- I thought it was a play.
- No. Uh...

119
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,280
<i>Romeo and Juliet: The Musical.</i>

120
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,360
This poster is very ugly.

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,720
Don't you think it looks like they're in
a forest full of dicks?

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,760
I hate musicals.

123
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,880
No! You can't hate musicals.

124
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,040
People who hate musicals have no soul.

125
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,800
- What about <i>Hedwig?</i>
- I liked it.

126
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,720
Uh-huh.

127
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
- Until they started singing.
- Oh, my gosh.

128
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, well,
you don't have to come tonight.

129
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
No, it's okay.

130
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll see it for you.

131
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Okay.

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
- But please, I was a true lush and my...
- Stop it, Quentin.

133
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
We have been over this.
You are not Romeo,

134
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,160
- you will never be my Romeo.
- Oh, enough, Quentin.

135
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,280
You're always there, all right?
Just fuck off!

136
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,160
Okay, guys, this is it.
Opening night. Woo!

137
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
This is what we've been working for.
Hugo, stay off the drugs.

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,400
Florence, pick up some props.

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,896
- I'm getting into character, sir.
- You can get into character

140
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
whilst helping Jackson
with the octopus arms.

141
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
Are you nervous about tonight?

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
Nerves are for amateurs.

143
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Hey.

144
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,080
- Are you going to the play tonight?
- Oh, yeah. Maybe after the finals.

145
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,120
I forgot that was today. Good luck.

146
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,560
How do I get you
to not be angry at me anymore?

147
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm not angry, Otis.

148
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm disappointed.

149
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Hey.

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
I didn't think you'd wanna speak
to me again.

151
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't think you should drink alcohol
for a really long time.

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,440
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Well, you did.

153
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
But it's okay.

154
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,840
Why do I always end up
pissing everyone off?

155
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,000
I think you're always trying so hard
to be a good guy

156
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
that you end up not being a good guy.

157
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
Like you're afraid
you'll turn into your dad or something.

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,800
I think you might be right.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,080
Thank you.

160
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,840
For what? Where are you going?

161
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,640
Remember, guys,
today is about having fun. Cube away, Dex!

162
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,400
But it's also really important
that we win.

163
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,520
This is not a drill, guys.
This is the endgame.

164
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Understood?

165
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,880
Wait. I made these for you.

166
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh. Thanks, Aimes.

167
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,080
- What's with the rogue "R"?
- I had an extra cupcake.

168
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
Oh, thanks.

169
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,360
It's a picture of your face
when it's concentrating.

170
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,680
Good luck. See you there.

171
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
Is she trying to tell me something?

172
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,760
Yeah, I think she's saying,
"I still love you, Steve,

173
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
but I need some more time."

174
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,320
Mum said to call
if you want anything else.

175
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,560
- All right, bye.
- How is your mother?

176
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,200
Do you think she misses me?

177
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't know, Dad.

178
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
I think Madam misses you though.

179
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
I was thinking
I could come back to school.

180
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,520
I know I've missed out on a lot,
but I want to find something I'm good at.

181
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't want to work in that shop forever.

182
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,400
Well, you haven't been fired yet.

183
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,040
Wonders never cease.

184
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,240
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's see, shall we?

185
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
Adam, you can go now.

186
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,120
Adam! Get out!

187
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Hi, Adam.

188
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
How are you?

189
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,800
My mum's divorcing my dad,
so he's sleeping in the school.

190
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,120
Yeah, everyone kind of knows.

191
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
I got fired from my job.

192
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,200
Yeah. Rahim told me.

193
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Sorry, man.

194
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Still play the French horn?

195
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
I didn't think you knew what it was.

196
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
Trombone sounded funny.

197
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,920
Eric, we're starting.

198
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,720
It's the final rehearsal
for the musical tonight.

199
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
You should come. I mean,

200
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
- I'm sure musicals aren't your ting, but...
- Is it like <i>Frozen?</i>

201
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
Because that was very sad.

202
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,240
Yeah. Uh...
It's a bit like <i>Frozen.</i>

203
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
It...

204
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,640
kind of looks like they're snogging
in a forest full of dicks.

205
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
That's exactly what I said!

206
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,320
It's a forest full of dicks, man!

207
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,160
- It's full of dicks!
- It's just mad.

208
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,400
I, uh... I better go.

209
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah. Um...

210
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,200
I...
I didn't mean what I said at the party...

211
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,760
about people not liking you.

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm very easy to not like.

213
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
I, uh...

214
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,160
I understand that I hurt you.

215
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Okay.

216
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
I just wanted you to know that.

217
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,240
<i>What makes you think
you are perimenopausal?</i>

218
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Well, I've been feeling very tired
and sort of heavy.

219
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
And I've had this intermittent tight...

220
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
feeling around my chest.

221
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,600
And, um, have there been
any big life changes recently?

222
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Well, yes.
I've, um, had some trouble at work,

223
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,280
and, uh, well, my teenage son is...

224
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
Well, he's a teenager.

225
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
And things ended with a man I was seeing
but, you know,

226
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,200
just ordinary, manageable life stuff.

227
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,400
When did you break up with your partner?

228
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,160
Uh, he wasn't my partner,
and I didn't break up with him.

229
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,520
I... Well, I might have pushed him away.

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Um...

231
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
And then I realized my mistake, and...

232
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,440
I tried to make it right,
but apparently, it was too late.

233
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Oh.

234
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
There's the feeling.

235
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,200
And did this pain start
when this man broke things off with you?

236
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,160
I mean, I'd... Yes, I might have noticed
the symptoms around that time, but...

237
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,960
...perimenopause causes
surges in adrenaline, right? And...

238
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,720
I think you might be suffering from
a broken heart.

239
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,080
Well, that's ridiculous.

240
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm a sex and relationship therapist,
I'm sure I'd know if I was...

241
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,360
suffering from a broken heart.

242
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
And I've been a GP for over 20 years
and not long ago,

243
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,880
I was hospitalized for a kidney infection
I didn't think I had.

244
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Right.

245
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,320
Let's get some tests done
and put your mind at ease.

246
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
<i>"The modern man is now lacking
a sense of pride</i>

247
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,440
in his innate masculinity.

248
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,320
How do we reclaim that pride?

249
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,240
I believe it starts
with taking ownership of ourselves.

250
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,600
How can we ever begin
a romantic relationship

251
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,160
without first owning our own emotions?
The answer is...

252
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,840
we can't. The first rule of owning oneself
is to live in the moment

253
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,520
and practice the power

254
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,560
of intention."

255
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Thank you.

256
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
This guy is so full of shit.

257
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
Thanks.

258
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,800
- Hi. Name?
- Ben.

259
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Ben.

260
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,680
- There you go. Hi, what's your name?
- Hey, Dad.

261
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Otis, uh, shouldn't you be in school?

262
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,280
Yeah, I was, um... I was hoping
we could talk about something.

263
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,720
Yeah, of course.
Just take a seat for half an hour. Yeah.

264
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,680
- Could I grab a photograph, Dr. Milburn?
- Yes. Of course.

265
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,120
- Brilliant, thank you.
- Thank you.

266
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,280
Hi, Remi. That was fantastic.
Good job. Thank you very much.

267
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Hey.

268
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,160
Hey, Erin. Erin, have you seen
my pet rabbit? It's gone missing.

269
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,800
- No, I've not seen him.
- It's a her, actually.

270
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
Did you know that female rabbits
are called does, and...

271
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,800
- male rabbits are called bucks?
- No, didn't know that.

272
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,360
- Yeah. It's all in this book called...
- I'm in a bit of a rush.

273
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,760
I just came back
to get my cigarettes. I'm sorry, babe.

274
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,800
- It's a really good book.
- That's weird.

275
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,680
I could have swore I locked that.

276
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
Fuck.

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now...

278
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,920
Hope you find your rabbit.

279
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,000
Thank you kindly.

280
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,240
They're here.

281
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
That's Holly Crankshaw,
their team captain.

282
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,600
She already won this competition
when she was 14.

All right. Let's go.

288
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,720
Yeah, hello. Hi, um...

289
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,360
I need to report a child at risk.

290
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Yeah.

291
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
Her parent is using drugs,
and she's unfit to care for her.

292
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,160
- We're on in five minutes, Maeve.
- Yeah, I'll be there in a sec.

293
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Yeah.

294
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,120
Yeah, it's my mother.

295
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,600
The release of Dr. Milburn's notes
was quite serious.

296
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,280
I can assure you we have the situation
completely under control.

297
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,920
Ms. Milburn has been removed from campus,
and our students are no longer at risk.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
She was on campus to help us protect
our students.

299
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,480
You managed to somehow make
a dire situation worse.

300
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,040
That was an unfortunate blip.

301
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,920
We are still a school
that prides itself on excellence.

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,216
But...
...our best and brightest students

303
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
are competing at the NSQC finals today,

304
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,200
and you must stay
for the first performance

305
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,560
of <i>Romeo and Juliet: The Musical</i> tonight.

306
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,200
It's going to be quite an event.

307
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,880
Is it just me, or does that forest
look like it's full of penises?

308
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
Okay, standby, studio.

309
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,160
Going in ten, nine,

310
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,880
eight, seven, six,

311
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
five, four...

312
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,400
Good afternoon

313
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,880
and welcome to the grand live final

314
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,320
of the National Student Quiz Championship.

315
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,240
On my left,
we have three-time previous champions,

316
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,800
it's the Knowledge Knights.

317
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,240
And on my right, fierce competitors
and wild cards, it's the Quiz Heads.

318
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
Let's get straight down to it
with a round on Art History.

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,680
So, question one...

320
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,080
Here you go, one lemonade.

321
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
So...

322
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,560
what's this all about then, son?

323
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,280
More girl trouble?

324
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,120
Why did you leave...

325
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
when I was a kid?

326
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,240
Oh, your... your mother and I
were unhappy, and...

327
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,120
Not why did you leave Mum,
why did you leave me?

328
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,120
What's this really about?

329
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
This is what this is really about, Dad.

330
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,040
I thought everything was Mum's fault.

331
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,680
That she was the reason I feel...

332
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,560
confused.

333
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,640
But at least she's there for me.

334
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,080
Where were you?

335
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Well, I-I had to move to America
for work...

336
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,560
No, you moved to America for yourself.

337
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,160
Dad, please just stop lying.

338
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,400
Hey, I have a feeling
there might be some...

339
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,160
some inner conflict going on here.

340
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,920
Yes, I feel angry...

341
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,280
all the time, and I'm trying to find out
what kind of man I want to be,

342
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,080
which is really hard when my dad
has been absent for most of my life.

343
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,000
Did you not like me
as much as you thought you would?

344
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,040
Of course I like you. I just...

345
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
Then how could you leave me?

346
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,480
Because I'm an arsehole.

347
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,400
I'm sure there are multiple ways
of diagnosing my personality,

348
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,320
but the chief ingredient is arsehole.

349
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
How do I not become an arsehole?

350
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
Just try and stay honest.

351
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,240
'Cause once you start lying, it's...

352
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,120
it's very hard to stop.

353
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,920
You know, when you're young...

354
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,200
you think that everybody out there
really... really gets you.

355
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,320
But, you know, actually,

356
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
only a handful of them do.

357
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,160
All the people who like you,
despite your faults.

358
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,160
And then if you discard them,
they will never come back.

359
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
So, when you meet those people...

360
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,120
you should just hold on to them.

361
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,560
Really, really tightly.

362
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,760
And don't let them go.

363
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,120
And whatever else you do,
never read this fucking book.

364
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,240
Hi, sorry. Could you...
could you sign my book?

365
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,840
- Yeah.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

366
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,320
- What's your name?
- Pete.

367
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,920
Pete. Hi, Pete.

368
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,520
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Big fan.

369
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Man up.

370
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
<i>...as we head into
the Geography round.</i>

371
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,000
<i>One minute on the clock and remember,
if you buzz, you must answer.</i>

372
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,640
<i>The Volga river runs into which sea?</i>

373
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,440
<i>The Caspian Sea.</i>

374
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,520
<i>Correct.
What is the length of the English Channel?</i>

375
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,760
<i>How many countries
begin with the letter...</i>

376
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Hey, Maeve.

377
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,360
I know you can't answer this right now
because I'm watching you on live TV.

378
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,600
But I wanted you to know
how proud of you I am.

379
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,240
And how unbelievably stupid I've been.

380
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
- Is your uncle here?
- Yusef.

381
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,080
I know you like my boyfriend.

382
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
You make him laugh.

383
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480
He doesn't laugh like that with me.

384
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
See you later, Yusef.

385
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,920
She's still sitting. You taught her well.

386
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,240
If you give me my job back,
I can teach her other things.

387
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,680
How to give a high-five or do a sexy wink.

388
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,920
Please, I know I made a mistake.
It won't happen again.

389
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Hello.

390
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Hi.

391
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,160
- Why're you dressed like a very small man?
- Oh, I'm going to my school musical.

392
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Can I have my pay?

393
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,800
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get my job back.

394
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,440
I want to go back to school,
but my dad can't find out I was fired.

395
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,360
What happened to the shop
wasn't Adam's fault.

396
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,240
The key wasn't working
last time I used it.

397
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,800
I forgot to tell you. It was my fault.

398
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,800
If you're gonna fire him,
you're gonna have to fire me too.

399
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
This is true?

400
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

401
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Well,

402
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,400
then you're both fired.

403
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,520
Go on, get out of my shop. Go!

404
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,000
Why did you do that?

405
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
Because I love you, dude.

406
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,320
Well, I know that I'm bisexual,
but I don't like you like that.

407
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,096
I thought you were a lesbian now
or into kitchen stuff

408
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,360
- or some shit?
- No, Adam, you idiot.

409
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,040
You're my friend.
I love you like a friend.

410
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Are you okay?

411
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,840
No one's ever said
I was their friend before.

412
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,400
You can put me down now.

413
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,920
<i>♪ Never change, never change
Never change, never change ♪</i>

414
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,520
<i>♪ Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love ♪</i>

415
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,440
- Five hundred and sixty kilometers.
- Is the right answer.

416
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,760
In which city
is the world's busiest airport?

417
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,480
- Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
- Correct.

418
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,200
Which country is home to two cities that
have a population of over one million,

419
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,360
but whose names are anagrams
of one another?

420
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,760
- It's Japan.
- No conferring.

421
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to dock you five points

422
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,400
and pass the question over
to the Knowledge Knights.

423
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,760
- Japan.
- Can you name the two cities?

424
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,560
Tokyo and Kyoto.

425
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,800
Is absolutely right,
and that's the end of this round.

426
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,320
We'll see you after these messages.

427
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,040
They're destroying us.

428
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,080
Uh, maybe we should just give up.

429
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,880
We're not giving up. We came here to win.

430
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,520
And if we're not gonna win,
at least we're gonna fight.

431
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,080
Do you understand me?
Like, we are the Quiz Heads,

432
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,960
and we are exceptional.
And more important than that,

433
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
we're a team.

434
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,480
So, if we're gonna go down,
we're gonna go down together.

435
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,840
Sorry, you kind of
turned into <i>Braveheart </i>there.

436
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,240
- I love that film.
- Pull yourself together, Steve.

437
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,880
And all of you, play to your strengths.

438
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,600
- What are we?
- The Quiz Heads.

439
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,520
The Quiz Heads.

440
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,280
Turns out you were right,
you're perimenopausal.

441
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,120
You're also pregnant.

442
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
What?

443
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
Well, that's impossible.

444
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Well, you are.

445
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,000
But he had a vasectomy.

446
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,800
Stranger things have happened.

447
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,880
You're pregnant, Jean.

448
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,320
Well, that makes
the whole heartbreak thing

449
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
so much more complicated.

450
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Mm.

451
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,040
- The tangent function.
- Absolutely right.

452
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,800
- Optimus Prime.
- Correct again.

453
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,640
George Eliot.

454
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,400
Charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent.

455
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,240
Dorothy Gish.

456
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,560
Jonathan Jamal Jennings.

457
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,640
- The Magic Cube.
- Yes!

458
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,800
Percy Pigs.

459
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,320
<i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>
by Immanuel Kant.

460
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Absolutely right.

461
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,760
And mu, M-U, is an example...

462
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, that sound means
this must be our last question.

463
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,360
All right mu, M-U, is an example of a...

464
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,960
A sound a cat makes.

465
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,120
I'm afraid I can't accept that,
Knowledge Knights, no.

466
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,040
Mu, M-U, is?

467
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,360
Population parameter. In statistics,
a parameter is any summary number,

468
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,880
such as an average or a percentage,
that describes an entire population.

469
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,800
I would have accepted
a population parameter.

470
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,200
That is absolutely
the full and correct answer.

471
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,760
And with that incredible recovery,
I can announce

472
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,240
that our NSQC UK champions of the year,
with a score of 89 to 88 are...

473
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,000
- the Quiz Heads!
- Yes!

474
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Whoa!

475
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,720
Congratulations.

476
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,280
Thank you.

477
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,800
Didn't think you could make it.

478
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,360
I can get another job interview,
I wasn't gonna miss this.

479
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,616
- Mum, listen, I need to...
- No. No, come on.

480
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,960
I'll treat you to a strawberry milkshake
on the way home. Come on.

481
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
- Maybe we could hang out tonight?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

482
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
I don't think I want to have sex yet.

483
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,600
We don't have to have sex ever again,
I just miss talking to you.

484
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
It's gonna be so cringe.

485
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
- Hey, Viv. Are you coming too?
- Where?

486
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,360
To watch Jackson Marchetti
make an absolute tit of himself.

487
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
That's not funny.

488
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,720
- Come on. He's an idiot jock.
- He's not an idiot.

489
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,160
He's trying something new
that he might not be very good at,

490
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
which is brave.

491
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,560
Whereas you do one thing really well,
and you never shut up about it.

492
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,680
If you're referring to
my Rubik's cube, I don't just do it well,

493
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,680
- I'm actually the 28th best...
- We know, Dex, we know.

494
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,200
We do kind of know, man.

495
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,640
- Half an hour until curtain, guys.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

496
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,960
Elbow, elbow, up, down,
twist, twist, up, down,

497
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,680
and pop it, and pop it.
Not at me, I'm faculty.

498
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
You got a problem, Quentin?

499
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,880
I'm surprised you came, Ms. Milburn.

500
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,040
I still have a child
at the school, Mr. Groff.

501
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,920
I'm here as a parent.

502
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm so proud of you, Froggy.

503
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
- Don't say that.
- No, I'm serious.

504
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,360
I know I've messed up so much,
and missed so many things,

505
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
but I'm never losing you again.

506
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
What's going on?

507
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,320
We're with Social Services.

508
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,240
There's been a report of drug use
in the presence of a minor.

509
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,200
Who reported it? Did you do this?

510
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,640
I didn't know they were coming.

511
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
Someone's reported something,
haven't they? And it's bullshit.

512
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,920
It's not bullshit, Mum.

513
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,880
You did this?

514
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,440
I know you've been using again,
so don't lie.

515
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
She's not safe.

516
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,600
I slipped... once.

517
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,440
It was a mistake.

518
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
I'm in a program, they can help me.

519
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,640
- You can't take my kid.
- We're not taking her anywhere,

520
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,856
we need to look inside the caravan
if that's all right.

521
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,256
- Stay away from my caravan!
- I'm sure we can sort this out,

522
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
- but we need to have a look inside.
- Mum!

523
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,280
We'll have to call the police
if you make a scene.

524
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,496
- Let them look inside...
- Stay the fuck away from me!

525
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Don't touch me!

526
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,600
How could you?

527
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,520
How could you do this to me?

528
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Here.

529
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Here.

530
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,400
You take her things.

531
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
You say you're not going to take her...

532
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,240
but you're lying.

533
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,520
You're fucking lying.

534
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
There's a hostile resident
not cooperating.

535
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
We need assistance.

536
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,200
- I don't know if I need a bow tie.
- You look very nice.

537
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
Nice suit.

538
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, she's all dressed up
for her new girlfriend.

539
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,000
Shut up, Dad.

540
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,960
Well, what's the problem?
I thought you were broken up with him.

541
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah, I'm kind of dating Lily now.

542
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,360
I didn't want to make it awkward.

543
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
It's not awkward.

544
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,320
That's... That's great.

545
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
Young people are strange, so, come on.

546
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,480
Actually, could I have a...

547
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,440
I wanted to apologize properly

548
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,520
for making things difficult
between you and my mum.

549
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,080
I found not being her number one priority
harder than I expected.

550
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,440
It was very immature of me.

551
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,360
Sorry for being an arsehole.

552
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Yeah...

553
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,600
you are a bit of an arsehole.

554
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,360
But you're also a good man, Otis.

555
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Do you think so?

556
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
I know so.

557
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,320
Shall we?

558
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats</i>

559
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,400
<i>and prepare for your erotic voyage
to the planet of Verona.</i>

560
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,120
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

561
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats</i>

562
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,960
<i>and prepare for your erotic voyage
to the planet of Verona.</i>

563
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,440
I thought this was Shakespeare?

564
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,520
Uh, yes. I think our students are taking
a postmodern approach.

565
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,600
Stand by.

566
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,520
- Sorry.
- Sir, I can't go on stage.

567
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,560
- I'm gonna humiliate myself.
- Jackson, babe.

568
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,520
- You're not a great actor...
- Yeah.

569
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
...yet.

570
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,016
The most important thing is
you're doing something you enjoy.

571
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,801
Maybe you're not nervous at all.
Maybe you're just super-duper pumped.

572
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
Okay? Doosh, doosh.

573
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
- It's not in there, is it?
- No.

574
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Enter Carl.

575
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,560
Two households, both alike in dignity,

576
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,480
in fair Verona, where we lay our scene.

577
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,280
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

578
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,840
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

579
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,360
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes,

580
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,360
a pair of star-crossed lovers

581
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
take their life.

582
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Mum...

583
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,280
Mum, please talk to me. Come on.

584
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,800
I will never forgive you.

585
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Never.

586
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,840
Come on, darling.

587
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,360
- You look nice, Mum.
- Something new I'm trying.

588
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,880
Is everything all right at school?

589
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,040
How was your father?

590
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Not good.

591
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Maybe we could...

592
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,200
let him come back?

593
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,760
Oh, darling.

594
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,360
Your father needed to fight for us
a very long time ago.

595
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
What do you mean?

596
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
When you love a person,

597
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,320
there's always a tiny part of you
that's terrified that one day

598
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,720
you're gonna lose them.

599
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,480
And I think that your father's so scared
of that emotion that...

600
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,240
he stops himself feeling anything at all.

601
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,480
But you have to let the people you love
know that you love them,

602
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,240
even if it causes you
a great deal of pain.

603
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Why?

604
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
It sounds awful.

605
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,200
Because you're alive.

606
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I have to go.

607
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
See...

608
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
where he comes.

609
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,960
So please you, step aside.
I'll know his grievance or be much denied.

610
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,760
Come, madam. Let's away.

611
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,520
- Shit.
- Good morrow, cousin!

612
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Fuck.

613
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,960
Good morrow, cousin!

614
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,480
Colin, does anyone have eyes on Jackson?

615
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,640
- Jackson, that's your cue.
- I'll go back on.

616
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,880
I know all the lines.

617
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,640
Shut the fuck up, Quentin,
you piece of shit. Jesus Christ.

618
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,040
- Good morrow, cousin!
- Get on stage, now!

619
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,376
And remember, you're not nervous,
you're just excited. Go!

620
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Sir!

621
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,160
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

622
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,760
Get on with it!

623
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,760
Good morrow, cousin!

624
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,880
Is the day so young?

625
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,440
Get back in the pool, Marchetti.

626
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Uh...

627
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,440
Jackson.

628
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,400
Is the day so young?

629
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,920
Is the day so young?

630
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,360
Is the day so young?

631
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,920
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

632
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,920
- Remember the heartbeats.
- What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

633
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,040
Uh, I am out of her favor,
where I am in love.

634
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,680
Alas, she is too fair, too wise.
Does thou not laugh?

635
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,320
- Good Romeo, forget to think of her!
- Oh, teach me how

636
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,320
- I should forget to think. Her beauty is...
- Peace!

637
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,680
Our cousin Mercutio draws near.

638
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,920
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

639
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,040
Cue Mercutio. Cue Mercutio.

640
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,880

Adam, get off the stage.
You're ruining my moment.

Eric...

00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,760

Why are the Groffs ruining my show?
Colin. Colin.

702
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,240

- Yeah.

You...

706
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,360
have all been corrupted...

707
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,360
by this woman!

708
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,080
She's giving sex advice to your children,

709
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,600
filling their heads
with dangerous nonsense.

710
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,440
No, that's not entirely true.

711
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,040
She was explicitly told
she was not here as a counselor.

712
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,800
I had no idea she'd be so unprofessional.

713
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,600
- Mr. Groff.
- Okay. She wasn't giving out sex advice.

714
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
I was.

715
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,280
And I shouldn't have been
'cause I'm 16 years old, and...

716
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,320
well, I've only had sex once.

717
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,200
Wasn't even very good, apparently, but...

718
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,600
But my mum was here
to listen to your problems

719
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,000
and give you the advice that
the school should have been giving anyway.

720
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
What?

721
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,960
My mum is an excellent therapist,

722
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,640
and she cares about people.
She only wants what's best for them.

723
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,440
Which is why
she's also such an amazing parent.

724
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,880
Well, that's ridiculous.

725
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,640
She reassured me that my labia
is a normal length.

726
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,720
And she really helped me accept myself.
It's changed my life.

727
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,040
I fucked some warm fruit
and she said I wasn't weird.

728
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,200
They're children, for God's sake!

729
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
They don't know what they want.

730
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,600
- This is all your fault.
- Mr. Groff.

731
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,000
I need to see you outside.

732
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Immediately.

733
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,000
It's completely ruined.

734
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,880
It was meant to be perfect.

735
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,760
Well, I think it was perfect.

736
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,080
Have you completely lost your mind?

737
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,440
- That woman is...
- That woman nothing, Michael.

738
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,041
I know your wife has left you,
and you've been sleeping at the school.

739
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,960
You're clearly not coping very well,
and you need to take some time off.

740
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,240
I'm fine.

741
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,440
It's not a request.
You will take leave as of today.

Yeah.

00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,040

with Jakob, I'm cool with it.
