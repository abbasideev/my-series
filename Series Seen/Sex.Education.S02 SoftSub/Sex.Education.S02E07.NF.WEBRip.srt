00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,480
Oi, oi, here comes Wiley.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,480
Hello, Kermit. Nice legs.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,240
Have you got green pubes, Kermit?

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,360
What is that?

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,920
- Oh, she is such a freak.
- She's a creep.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,680
You should be careful dressing like that.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,600
And you should be careful perpetuating
old-fashioned patriarchal ideology.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,720
It'll make it difficult
for people to like you.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,160
Hey!

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,000
Come on, Kermit, show us your pubes!

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,320
You're a bitch!

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Yeah, I am.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,200
<i>♪ Walking on the beaches
Looking at the peaches ♪</i>

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Mmm.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Come on then.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
That's it.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,720
- Good morning.
- Ah!

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Why are you in my bed?

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,560
If you tell anyone about this,
I'll destroy your life.

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Did we have sex?

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
Of course we had sex, Otis.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm not here because I enjoy your company.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,680
But I can't find the condom.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,000
We had sex without a condom?

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,760
- No, I'm pretty sure we used one.
- Well, where is it?

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know, it's vanished.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Mmm...

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,840
You don't think
your vagina swallowed it, do you?

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,760
- I heard about the girl...
- I can't believe I had sex with you.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Okay, Ruby,
we definitely used a condom, right?

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,760
Yes. I'm, like, 99 percent certain.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
Oh!

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,720
- Sorry.
- Otis!

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,360
Come down.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Hello.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,720
- I'm Ruby.
- Hello, Ruby.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
I covet your pant suits.

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Oh.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,776
- Thank you. This one's...
- I was just being polite.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,080
I've gotta get to school.

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,880
You said a small gathering!

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,960
It was only supposed to be ten people,

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,200
but Eric invited a whole load more

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
and suddenly 150 strangers
were in the house.

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,160
- A hundred and fifty strangers?
- It was not my intention.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,200
Otis! I'm not hearing
a lot of responsibility being taken here.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,600
I have clients coming this afternoon
and my house is trashed!

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Oh, it's too loud, and I'm late,
and my head hurts, and I-I-I...

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
I will help you clean later.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,720
- Later?
- Yes.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Later? Otis!

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,640
Uh...

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,560
See you, cheeky chops. Love you.

54
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,560
- Are you spying again?
- I don't trust her.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
- Who, Body Slammer?
- No, her mum.

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,560
What's she doing there?

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,760
Joe, have a look, would you? I can't see.

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know, she's watching TV.

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,640
I knew she was up to something.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,680
Oh, yeah. Quick, call the police,
our neighbor's watching <i>Bargain Hunt!</i>

61
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
Oh! Oh! Ah!

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320
Hey!

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,320
How are you feeling, Casanova?

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,680
Why is the world so bright?

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,720
Because you got very drunk,
offended your unrequited love

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,880
and ex-girlfriend, puked on yourself,
and danced really badly

67
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
in front of most of the people
at this school.

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,880
- Eric.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
- I had sex with Ruby.
- What?

70
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you sure you had sex?

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Well, she definitely thinks we had sex.
The details are hazy.

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,360
I feel really strange.
I feel like I'm either having

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,600
an unusually long panic attack
or I'm just very, very thirsty... or both.

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,960
Okay, calm down and listen to me.

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
Probably wasn't the romantic
forest glade fantasy

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,520
- you imagined with Maeve.
- I did not imagine that.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,880
But you are not a virgin anymore! What?

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,800
- That's exciting, right?
- It's not.

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,336
- Sex has consequences.
- Well, it's not like you're gonna father

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,680
Ruby's evil spawn.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,440
You did use a condom, right?

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Right?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,760
Otis, I have noticed
that you've not answered my question.

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,720
Oh, my God.

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
Hi, Maeve.

86
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm really sorry about last night.

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
- I said...
- I heard you shagged Ruby, dude.

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,320
Who knew Sex Kid was such a player!

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Congratulations.

90
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,280
That was withering.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,080
Oh, no, no, no!

92
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm embarrassed!

93
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,280
- Mate, have you seen this?
- What's happening?

94
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,880
I was drunk.

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,040
- Yes, yes, you were, mate.
- Seriously!

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,800
I can't believe
you told Dr. Milburn I had crabs.

97
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
- I said you might have one crab.
- Holy shit.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,640
Miss Sands loves doing dirty talk
with Mr. Hendricks.

99
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
- Amazing.
- That is amazing.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,200
What did Jean do?

101
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,640
Your mum said I was normal.

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
She lied.

103
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,960
"Connor Pearson admits to masturbating
up to 17 times a day,

104
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,760
- which is borderline obsessive."
- I'm a monster!

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
This is bad, very bad.

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,760
How could Jean leave her notes
lying around?

107
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,200
Well, I have to go anyway.

108
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,600
I've got Swing Band practice.

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Seventeen times?

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Dirty, dirty pig.

111
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
What on earth?

112
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I thought it was confidential!

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
I promise you we will
get to the bottom of this.

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,280
Jackson, wait!

115
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,600
- I had to tell them.
- We're not friends, Viv.

116
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,240
You said some pretty horrible things
to me too, you know?

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,440
Fine. We were never friends
in the first place.

118
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
Aimes, you're covered in mud.

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Yeah. I am.

120
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,600
- Can we talk?
- Not right now, Steve. I'm late for gym.

121
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Aimes, guess what?

122
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,560
- Otis had sex with Ruby last right.
- I'm sure it didn't mean anything.

123
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Are you okay?

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

125
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm sure he didn't mean it.
He was really drunk.

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Yeah.

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Yeah.

128
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,760
Hello, Jean speaking.

129
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,440
<i>Hello, Miss Milburn.</i>

130
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,480
<i>I need you to come into the school
at 4:00 p.m. today.</i>

131
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,840
There's been an incident.

132
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,840
<i>- Can you tell me what it's concerning?</i>
- Just be here at 4:00 p.m.

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'll be there.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,440
Shit! Guys, come and take a look at this.

135
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
Oh, my God!

136
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,160
No dillydallying, girls.

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
It wasn't me.

138
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,680
- It was not me.
- I wouldn't have the time.

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,120
Someone is in very serious trouble.

140
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,440
Ah. You're on time. That's odd.

141
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,680
I have an errand to run,
so will you be all right with Jessie?

142
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
- Uh, yeah, I like dogs.
- Are you sure?

143
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,960
She's very annoying.
You know, she can't even sit.

144
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
We'll be fine.

145
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Um...

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,840
Sir, can I go to the toilet, please?

147
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,120
Can't it wait, Milburn?
lt's almost the end of the day.

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
No. Sir, I...

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
I have hemorrhoids.

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,080
Oh, yes. I feel your pain.

151
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,720
Hemorrhoid Club.

152
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
Otis!

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Otis!

154
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Uh...

155
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
- What?
- Shh.

156
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Okay, so...

157
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,320
you know how I said I was 99 percent sure
about the condom?

158
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,040
- Yes.
- It's more like 96.5.

159
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,200
The details are a bit hazy

160
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,520
and I think I remember
putting it in the bin,

161
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,960
but I can't be sure.

162
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
Okay. What should we do?

163
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,320
- Shall we go play <i>Smash Bros?</i>
- Oh, I can't.

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,760
I've got to go to a service
at my church tonight.

165
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,520
- Is church boring?
- No.

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,240
It's actually quite fun, you know.
There's singing, there's plantain,

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,600
and if you're lucky,
sometimes this auntie called Gloria

168
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,760
- starts speaking in tongues.
- Cool.

169
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
- Can I come with you?
- You don't want to come to my service.

170
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,400
I think it will be interesting,
unless you don't want me to.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
No! Okay, sure.

172
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,800
But, um...
...I have to be a bit different there.

173
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
Like, a bit more serious,
if you get what I mean.

174
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah. That's okay.

175
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,520
- You sure?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
Let's go to church.

177
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,160
What are you doing here?

178
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,880
We've made an appointment
with your counselor.

179
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,200
- Can't we do this another time?
- No, we're doing it now. Get in.

180
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
Get in the car.

181
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
Well, well.

182
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,800
Here we are. I don't like keeping you
after school, girls, but this is serious.

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,840
I had nothing to do with this,
and it'll look really bad on my school CV,

184
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,720
- so may I go home, please?
- No, you may not.

185
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Somebody in this room
thought it would be funny

186
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
to write something very cruel about me
on that mirror.

187
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,960
We're going to sit here
until they admit it was them.

188
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,040
No one has anything to say?

189
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Fine. You will circle
every "A" in the paper

190
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,240
until one of you owns up.

191
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,256
- That's not very productive, miss.
- Neither is slut-shaming your teacher.

192
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,640
Get circling, girls.
I'll be back to check on you.

193
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,040
Have you ever done this before?

194
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,960
No! What are you trying to say?
You slept with me too, you know.

195
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,000
I know, I'm not trying to say anything.

196
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,880
Look, I'm not having your pale,
unusually long children, okay?

197
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,600
- So just go in and get it already.
- Me?

198
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,960
I can't be seen buying
the morning after pill, Otis.

199
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,160
People will talk.

200
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,920
Go on. Go on.

201
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,680
It's important
to tell Dr. Aiken everything.

202
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,920
You might need to up your meds.
You are taking them?

203
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,720
Your mum just asked you
a question.

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes. I'm taking them.

205
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Well, why didn't you answer her then?

206
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,800
- Shit. Oh, God. I think it's a flat.
- Brilliant, we're gonna be late.

207
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,336
- I can't control it, can I?
- You drive too fast.

208
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,720
I don't need this right now.

209
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
So, who's changed a tire before?

210
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
It wouldn't be good for my hand.

211
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Brilliant.

212
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,880
Very sensitive sinuses.

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,640
And can I get
the morning after pill, please?

214
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,840
- Excuse me?
- The morning after pill?

215
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,656
- I can't hear you.
- The morning after pill.

216
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,080
- I still can't hear you.
- The morning after pill.

217
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,320
I can't sell it to you.

218
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,360
- Why not?
- You don't have a vagina, sir.

219
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
It's not... It's nasal spray.

220
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,800
You need to buy it in person.

221
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,840
What? Why? Ugh!

222
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,320
This is so humiliating.

223
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,440
It's not humiliating.

224
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,080
Okay? I mean,
stuff like this happens all the time.

225
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880
Condoms break,
or people forget to use them,

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,440
or they just go missing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

227
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,120
I also want you to know
if you are pregnant

228
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,400
and chose to keep the baby,
I'll quit school, get a job

229
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
and provide for you both.

230
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,840
- When did you last have sex?
- Last night.

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
- Obviously.
- Did you use contraception?

232
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Yes.

233
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,880
- I think so.
- The prophylactic's missing.

234
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
Sorry, I'm not here.

235
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,120
- When was your last period?
- Two weeks ago.

236
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Have you taken
the emergency contraceptive pill before?

237
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,960
No. Why do people keep asking me that?
I'm not a slut.

238
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,840
Does anyone in your immediate family
have any health problems?

239
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,280
My dad has MS. He was diagnosed last year.
It's quite bad.

240
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
So, can I have the pill or not?

241
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,360
That'll be £25.

242
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,560
It's his penis, he's paying for it.

243
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,000
I am. I am?

244
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,640
- Please don't tell anyone I was here.
- I've no idea who you are.

245
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,720
That's impossible.
Everyone knows who I am.

246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Mm.

247
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,840
- Right, you've gotta be kidding me.
- Look, I'm just saying,

248
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,560
if you push it in first...

249
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,816
- Mind your hand out of the way.
- Oh, just push it in first, and then...

250
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,920
Oh, my God. This is stupid.
I'm calling them.

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,120
- I said we don't have to.
- This is so typical of you.

252
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,720
Why can't you just admit you can't do it?

253
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,080
I can do it.

254
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Well, if you can do it
then why isn't it done?

255
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,840
And why are you laughing?

256
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,640
Because you both just need
to get a divorce.

257
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,920
Why would you say that?

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,880
Because it's true.

259
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,560
You fight all the time.

260
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,160
You're so angry at mum,
but you pretend that you're not.

261
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
And you're so scared

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,520
I won't love you like a biological mum

263
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,856
that you just spend most of your time
pushing us both away.

264
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
I just think we'd all be a lot happier
if you just get a divorce.

265
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,760
Yeah, I'll go get her.

266
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Mum!

267
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm finished too.

268
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,936
I think you're supposed to circle
all the "A" s,

269
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,520
- not just the singular ones.
- You're so dumb sometimes, Aimee.

270
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,760
- Olivia, do you want this pen in your eye?
- You guys are such clichés.

271
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,440
Except for you, Lily.
You're genuinely weird.

272
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,280
- Thanks.
- What category are you in, Pythagoras,

273
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,720
- other than freak?
- The really, really intelligent one.

274
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,080
Oh, really?

275
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,520
Olivia, Mr. Groff wants to see you.

276
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,480
- Ooh!
- Shut up.

277
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,600
Anyone have anything to admit?

278
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,200
- You can circle the "I" s next.
- Please, Miss Sands. This is pointless.

279
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,600
Okay, you want a challenge?

280
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,560
You can spend the rest of detention
preparing a presentation

281
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,560
on what binds you together as women.

282
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,560
One or all of you wanted to tear
a fellow female down,

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,400
now you can spend some time thinking about
what you have in common instead.

284
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
- You are joking, right?
- No, I'm not.

285
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
You have two hours to enlighten me.

286
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,760
Unless you want a month
of detentions instead?

287
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,360
I'd like you to know
we take these issues

288
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,040
very seriously indeed.

289
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,840
Olivia, come in.

290
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,160
Were you aware that Malek had received
sex advice from Miss Milburn?

291
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,040
Malek Amir talked about his girlfriend
wanting to incorporate...

292
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,216
- fetish...
- Those are my private notes,

293
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,440
and they're not meant to be read
by anybody else.

294
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,560
And I'm sorry,
but I don't know how they were misplaced.

295
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,120
Olivia, do you know
how old your boyfriend is?

296
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
He's... He's 16.

297
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Fifteen.

298
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,840
- Fifteen?
- Yeah, I skipped a year in primary school.

299
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,320
- What do you mean "fetish"?
- Amir is not an Indian surname.

300
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
We are Iranian.

301
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,320
- Iranian.
- You're 15?

302
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,080
You could go to prison for statutory rape!
This is very serious.

303
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
- Iranian?
- Fifteen? What the fuck, Malek?

304
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
Okay, Mum...

305
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,800
We are not going to press charges.

306
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,560
But how could you give sex advice
to children? It's despicable.

307
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,560
I didn't give sex advice.

308
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,000
I answered a question
about a possible fetish.

309
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,840
And I gave the correct information
concerning that subject.

310
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,816
- I... I didn't tell them to do anything...
- You shouldn't have been talking

311
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,280
to 15-year-olds about fetish at all.
This is not what you were employed to do.

312
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,000
And I made that very clear.

313
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,840
- Yes, but my report...
- Is no longer welcome on campus

314
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
and nor are you.

315
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,600
- Back to detention, Olivia.
- For God sake!

316
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,120
Can we talk about how exactly
my private notes

317
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,080
got distributed around your campus?

318
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
I have no idea.

319
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,480
I could just tell them it was Sex Kid
who gave us the actual advice.

320
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm sorry, what?

321
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,760
You know, Otis. His advice
was super strange, but it worked.

322
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,400
But he charges a lot for it though,
which sucks.

323
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Well, that's why I came to you
because you're free.

324
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,680
This is so stupid.

325
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,080
Well, we have to come up with something
if we want to go home.

326
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,560
- Does anybody like fantasy gaming?
- I do.

327
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,240
- I love <i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>
- Oh, I'm more into

328
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,800
dressing up as Ripley from <i>Alien.</i>

329
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
I don't get cosplay.

330
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,800
- What about shopping?
- I hate shopping.

331
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,600
- Me too.
- Can't we just pretend

332
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,080
we're all into shopping or cosplay?

333
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
That would be cheating.

334
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,280
We could try a mind map.

335
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
- What did Groff want?
- I might be going to prison

336
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,080
because apparently, my boyfriend's 15.

337
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,400
- Anybody else also into younger men?
- What are we doing?

338
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,000
- Figuring out what we have in common.
- ...things we all like.

339
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, are you?

340
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,960
- Yeah, I'm great.
- Great.

341
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
It's going well then.

342
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Ugh.

343
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,360
How long have you got?

344
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,816
I gave them an impossible assignment
about female solidarity,

345
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,000
- they won't finish for ages.
- You're so evil.

346
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,600
Say it again.

347
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,080
You're so evil.

348
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Mmm.

349
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,200
The church is very beautiful,
Mrs. Effiong. It's not what I thought.

350
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,760
- Do you attend the mosque?
- Anthea. You can't ask that.

351
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
Sorry, Rahim. Just ignore my sister.

352
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
- I thought you were Muslim.
- Anthea.

353
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,720
Eric, I don't think
your sister means to be rude.

354
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,480
- I just wanted to know.
- Just... You don't have to answer that.

355
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,320
No, it's okay. My family's atheist.

356
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
What's an atheist?

357
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,000
It's someone who believes
that there is no God.

358
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,960
Okay? Shall we be quiet now?

359
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,360
We can't touch each other in church.

360
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,760
<i>♪ We shall meet on that beautiful shore ♪</i>

361
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,360
Don't come over here.
I don't want to talk to you right now,

362
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,840
- hence why I walked away.
- It's ridiculous, Mum.

363
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,520
I just... I need a moment alone, Jackson.

364
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,720
I'm not going anywhere
until we talk, so...

365
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,800
That was the most hurtful thing
you could possibly say to me.

366
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Yeah, I know.

367
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,320
That's why I said it.

368
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,880
- I didn't mean it, I was just angry.
- No, you did mean it.

369
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,600
I didn't mean to make you cry, Mum.

370
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,720
I've just always been so afraid
that you would say I wasn't your real mum,

371
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,600
and now you've actually said it,
I'm almost relieved.

372
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,400
- Of course you're my real mum.
- But you didn't come through me.

373
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,960
- So?
- That's why I was so happy

374
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,336
when you said you wanted to swim
because that's my passion,

375
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,920
something we could do together.

376
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,600
I thought it was because
you couldn't compete anymore...

377
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
and you were living your dream through me.

378
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,560
Well, maybe there's a bit
of truth in that.

379
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,600
- I genuinely thought you enjoyed it.
- I did enjoy it...

380
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
a lot.

381
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Do you know what I enjoyed most
about swimming when I was a kid?

382
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
Spending time with you.

383
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,440
You were my hero, Mum.

384
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,600
When we were together,
I felt like I could do anything.

385
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
Why did you have to grow up?

386
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,160
- I don't want to swim anymore.
- I know.

387
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
It just doesn't make me happy.

388
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,840
But it's got nothing
to do with our relationship, okay?

389
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,240
You've gotta let me figure out who I am
and what else I like to do on my own.

390
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,400
But you'll always, always...

391
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,200
be my real mum.

392
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,600
I got a part in the school play.

393
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
- What?
- Yeah.

394
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,800
Playing Romeo.

395
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,680
Well, you were very believable as Joseph.

396
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Jessie. No.

397
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,040
Sit.

398
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Wait.

399
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Wait.

400
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,280
Sit.

401
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,400
Here you are.

402
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,640
How are you you, New Kid?

403
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,640
Since when do you ask questions?

404
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm trying to work on my small talk.

405
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
How is he?

406
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Eric?

407
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
He's confused.

408
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,840
I don't know what's going on between
the two of you,

409
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,560
but if you hurt him, I'll...

410
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
I'll mess you up.

411
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,520
I don't want to hurt him anymore.

412
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Then don't.

413
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,120
I said fucking diet.

- Welcome.
- Thank you.

426
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh, sorry. I don't believe in Jesus.

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,080

432
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,960
You did give me consent, right?
I'm kind of worried you didn't.

433
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,640
Yes, Otis. I definitely said yes.

434
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,720
When I'm sad, I make out with nerdy boys.

435
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,120
It was 100 percent intentional.

436
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,520
Why nerdy boys?

437
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,880
Because they think they're in love
with me, which feels amazing,

438
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,520
until they get clingy
and want to show me all their things.

439
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,720
I don't think I'm in love with you.

440
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,280
Sure you don't.

441
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,480
Was I... Was I okay at the sex bit?

442
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,000
- It was kind of my first time.
- You're a virgin?

443
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Well, I was.

444
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
You weren't great,
but you weren't terrible.

445
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,240
You kept asking me if I was okay.

446
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,960
- It's important to check in.
- It was every ten seconds.

447
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,720
Were you sad because of your dad?

448
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Yeah, a bit.

449
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,280
He had to quit his job,
and my mum's really stressed about it.

450
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,080
But mainly I was upset
because I over-plucked my left eyebrow,

451
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,800
and I'd just got them symmetrical.

452
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,920
They look very even to me.

453
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Thank you for checking in.
A lot of guys don't.

454
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,000
There must be something we all like.

455
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,920
- Chocolate?
- Yes.

456
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No.

457
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,720
Let's just tell Miss Sands that we resent
being grouped together

458
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,760
and forced to bond on the basis
of our gender.

459
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
Or I could pretend I like chocolate.

460
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,400
I know you are comfortable
with being dishonest, but I'm not.

461
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,640
What's that supposed to mean?

462
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,800
You pretend to be all radical
and feminist,

463
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,800
when you're just a girl who goes around
stabbing other girls in the back.

464
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,280
- It's not true.
- So, you didn't try

465
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,000
- and steal my boyfriend then?
- Can we not fight?

466
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,840
Shut up. It just got interesting.

467
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,640
I didn't try and steal your boyfriend,
Ola. I had to tell him how I felt.

468
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,640
You didn't have to, Maeve. You chose to.

469
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,280
Did you even like Otis?

470
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,440
Or did you just want to win?
You're a snake.

471
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Yeah? At least I don't pretend
to be so sweet and nice all the time.

472
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,760
You don't know anything about me!

473
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,600
Stop fighting over a stupid boy!

474
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880
Aimes, why are you crying?

475
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Because I can't get on the bus.

476
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,880
Oh, Aimes. It's okay.

477
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,760
It's okay.

478
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Um, can I come and see you?

479
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
I... I'm...

480
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,640
I didn't know who else to talk to.

481
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,320
You can all stop looking at me now.

482
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,640
So you can't get on the bus

483
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,360
because you think
that man's gonna be on it again?

484
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,240
No. It's more that he had
this really kind face.

485
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
I remember because he smiled at me,

486
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,080
and he didn't look like
some wanking psycho killer.

487
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,680
So it's, like, if he could do something
like that, then anyone could.

488
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,640
I always felt safe before,
and now I don't.

489
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,040
- Probably sounds stupid.
- It doesn't sound stupid.

490
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,640
I was groped
at the train station last year.

491
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,000
<i>We were going to a gig in the city,
this group of guys walked past</i>

492
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,640
<i>and one of them grabbed my tit.</i>

493
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,560
<i>And it really, really hurt.</i>

494
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,920
So, I sometimes feel funny in crowds too.

495
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,400
It was like they thought
my body was theirs or something.

496
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,600
Yeah, like we're public property.

497
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,240
A few years ago,
some boys were catcalling me.

498
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,360
<i>This woman told me it was my fault
because my shorts were too revealing.</i>

499
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,200
<i>So I went home
and I cut them even shorter,</i>

500
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,840
because fuck them.

501
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,856
Good. Why should you have to change
your behavior because of what they did?

502
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Exactly.

503
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,280
I used to go to the local swimming pool
all the time when I was a kid.

504
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,320
<i>One day this guy flashed me his penis
in the pool...</i>

505
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,040
<i>and it looked all dangly
and funny under the water.</i>

506
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,080
I told my mum about it,
and she wouldn't let me go back anymore.

507
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,680
It's sad because
the pool was my favorite place to go.

508
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
- That's so unfair.
- I guess,

509
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,760
but statistically, two thirds of girls
experience unwanted sexual tension

510
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,880
or contact in public spaces
before the age of 21.

511
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,360
So, it's not unusual.

512
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,680
Why are some men so obsessed
with getting their dicks out?

513
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,720
Sometimes I go on Chat Roulette,

514
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,960
and there are so many flaccid penises
on there.

515
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,600
<i>There are long ones, short ones, fat ones.</i>

516
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,080
<i>There was once even one that looked like
it had a tiny face.</i>

517
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,480
I think if I had an extra arm growing
in between my legs,

518
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,080
- I might want to show everyone too.
- Yeah.

519
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,480
- Maybe it's a power thing.
- Yeah.

520
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,200
I think the man on the bus
liked that I was afraid.

521
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
A man followed me home from work
about a year ago.

522
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,080
<i>Every time I sped up, he sped up.</i>

523
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
<i>It was so scary.</i>

524
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,640
He ran off when he saw my dad,
which made me angry

525
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,200
because I don't want to be dependent
on another man to protect me.

526
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,760
- I'm sorry that happened to you.
- You too.

527
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,440
Thank you.

528
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,200
At least we can go home now.

529
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Dicks.

530
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,376
- I'll tell you who loves ginger nuts.
- Yeah?

531
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
- Eric Clapton.
- Really?

532
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,400
- Absolutely loves them.
- Are you joking?

533
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
Stop!

534
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,160
I only did it 'cause
I love you, and I found out you love him.

535
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,400
He can't offer you what I can, miss.

536
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,880
I have an innate appreciation
for older women,

537
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,720
and I can roll a joint
into the shape of a swan.

538
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,680
That is problematic on so many levels,

539
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,520
but I must say the lipstick
was an ingenious touch.

540
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,800
- You really think so?
- It's not happening, Kyle. Okay?

541
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Follow me.

542
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,240
- I love you.
- Now!

543
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Sit.

544
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,240
- Stand.
- I don't believe it.

545
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Sit.

546
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,640
It's a miracle. Ha!

547
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,160
You're a smart boy.
Why aren't you in school?

548
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm no good at school.

549
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,640
Yes, well, you carry on like this,
you're looking at employee of the month.

550
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,760
Huh?

551
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm going to go to the movies tonight,
so you can lock up for me.

552
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,280
I'm going to go and get ready.

553
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Girls...

554
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

555
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,120
We've found the culprit.
You may go home now.

556
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm very sorry for wasting your time.

557
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,400
Well, great. I knew it.

558
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,840
Oh, out of curiosity,
what did you come up with?

559
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
What binds you together?

560
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,600
Other than non-consensual penises, miss,
not much.

561
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,360
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I think so.

562
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
I don't feel sad, I just feel angry.

563
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
I know something that might help.

564
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,240
I like your family. They're sweet.

565
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
What do you mean "sweet"?

566
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,480
The way they believe
in all that God stuff.

567
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,680
They think it's real.

568
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,080
I believe in it too.

569
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah, but not properly.

570
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,080
- You pretend to keep the peace, right?
- No.

571
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,000
No, I believe in God, Rahim.

572
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,320
How can you believe in a god
that doesn't think you should exist?

573
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,480
Okay, this is awkward.

574
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,520
No, my family had to leave their country
because of religion.

575
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,480
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

576
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
- I didn't know that.
- It's okay.

577
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,280
It's our differences
that make me love you.

578
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,160
We'll agree to disagree.

579
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Love?

580
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,440
Does that freak you out?

581
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,600
No, no, no. Uh...

582
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,080
I... I love you too.

583
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
<i>Ah, putain!</i>

584
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,960
I think my heart stopped for a moment.

585
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Let's go.

586
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,760
I just cannot believe
he's been taking all that money

587
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,520
from all those other students.

588
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,280
I feel like
I don't know him at all, like...

589
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,240
like I've got a stranger
living in my house.

590
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,560
I think we can't ever truly know
these creatures that we created.

591
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,520
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Talk to him.

592
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
That's all you can do.

593
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Hey.

594
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,800
Want to get something to eat after this...

595
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
with me?

596
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm afraid I can't do that, Jean.

597
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,680
It was one stupid kiss.

598
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,560
You really can't forgive me?

599
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
You know...

600
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,320
I may not be as intellectual
as your ex-husband,

601
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
but I do know my boundaries.

602
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,520
I can't go through
that kind of pain again.

603
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm not sure if I could get up.

604
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,800
- My girls need me.
- Mm.

605
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Mm.

606
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,480
You're not ready
for the kind of intimacy I'm looking for.

607
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Understood.

608
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Goodbye, Jakob.

609
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah.

- Dinner is in ten minutes.
- Okay.

624
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,480
Your thoughts are very loud, Mum.

625
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,240
- That boy is not right for you.
- You don't think any boy's right for me.

626
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,760
It's not him, it's you.

627
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,520
You act like a different person
when you're around him,

628
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,360
like you're trying to be something
that you're not.

629
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,080

What do I do?

633
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,720
Think about something
that makes you really, really angry,

634
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,320
and then smash it as hard as you can.

635
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Mmm.

636
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,720
I'm angry that I'm not very good
at baking cakes.

637
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,240
- Yes!
- Woo!

638
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,960
- Come on.
- Go on, Aimee!

639
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm angry that Steve keeps trying so hard
to make things better,

640
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,640
but he doesn't understand.

641
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,000
- Yes! Come on!
- Woo!

642
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,160
I'm angry that a horrible man
ruined my best jeans

643
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,240
and nobody did anything,
and now, I can't get on the fucking bus!

644
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,480
- Yeah!
- Yes!

645
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,720
- This is amazing!
- Woo!

646
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,680
- Gonna keep smashing stuff!
- Yeah!

647
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,240
- Yes!
- Give it to them!

I did try and steal him.

00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,320
- I'm sorry.
- I did like him...

654
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,840
but I kind of wanted to beat you too.

655
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
Let's get you home.

656
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
Wanna walk me home?

657
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Yeah.

658
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,120
Hey, Mum.

659
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,920
Are you all right?
I heard about what happened.

660
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Otis.

661
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,880
Have you been giving sex advice
to students at school for money?

662
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,520
What are you talking about?

663
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,880
- Tell me the truth.
- I am.

664
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,480
You look just like your father
when you lie.

665
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,920
- Let's talk about this rationally.
- I can't talk to you right now.

666
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Mum.

667
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,040
Oh, shit!

668
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,360
I didn't think you wanted
to be my friend anymore.

669
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,280
This wasn't in my plan.

670
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,400
Boys that smell a bit sweaty
were in my plan,

671
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,960
not girls that smell like vanilla pods.

672
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,480
- I don't smell like a vanilla pod.
- Yeah, you do.

673
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,240
And car air freshener... sometimes.

674
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
You're very clean.

675
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,000
Sorry I confused you, but...

676
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,880
it really hurt
when you started avoiding me.

677
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Fine.

678
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,160
We can still be friends.

679
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
Fine.

680
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,600
I'll see you at school then.

681
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,000
Wait. I think I don't wanna be
just friends.

682
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,920
Why?

683
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,160
Because you smell
so much better than a boy.

684
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,560
I just...

685
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,040
- Hello.
<i>- Hey.</i>

686
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,360
<i>So, your mum's lying about going to work.</i>

687
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,736
<i>I saw her pretending to leave this morning
and sneaking back into the caravan again.</i>

688
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,880
Shit stirrer.

689
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,400
<i>I'm only telling you what I saw.</i>

690
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,120
<i>Take it or leave it.</i>

691
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,560
- Okay. Night, Isaac.
<i>- Good night.</i>

692
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,320
Why do you always double knot?

693
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,240
I don't want you running off, do I?

694
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,680
You're funny.

695
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,240
Ooh!

696
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,120
- Say bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

697
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Bye-bye.

698
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,360
All right, 007, enough.

699
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
God.

700
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,680
- Hi, Mum.
- Fucking arsehole.

701
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
What you doing?

702
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,400
- I had to pop back...
- Isaac told me he saw you yesterday.

703
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,960
I got fired.
I didn't know how to tell you.

704
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Um...

705
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,200
I felt so ashamed.

706
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,440
But... I am looking for something else.

707
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,720
- Are you using again?
- No, I am not.

708
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,640
I swear on my life.
I swear on your life, on Elsie's life.

709
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,640
I'm clean.

710
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,080
Please believe me.

711
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,720
I believe you.

712
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,680
Lie to me one more time, and you're out.

713
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,120
What are you doing here?

714
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Getting the bus.

715
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,720
We're all getting the bus.

716
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,440
- Are you getting on or what?
- Give her a minute.

717
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,960
It's just a stupid bus.

718
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,200
It's just a stupid bus.
