Oh, did you already douche?

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,720
I mean, unless you're cool with it
maybe being a bit messy.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Uh, no.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,480
Of course I already douched.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
'Cause I like to be clean.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,560

Help!

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,320
I've been mugged.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,840
Come now. It's an emergency.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,520
Hold on. Wait. No, slow down.
Don't move, I'll be right there.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,200
So, Olivia's been mugged.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,880
Sorry. I've gotta go.

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Rain check?

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,680
Yeah, of course. I hope she's okay.

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
people think you're mean,

- All good?

- Perfect.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh, you're a twat.

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,040
It's looking good.

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,680
So when can he get back to training?

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,600
Shouldn't I wait, Mum?
It's literally just come off.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,000
You'll be fine. Take it slow, obviously,

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,000
but it's important
to build your strength up.

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
You can start training again this week.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
Maybe tomorrow evening?

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,640
- Thanks for taking her, Cynthia.
- That's all right, love.

49
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Jonathan's always wanted a sibling.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,560
Your mum's holding down that job then?
Wonders never cease.

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,760
Yeah, she's enjoying it, I think.

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,040
See you later. Be good.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,480
- Bye.
- Bye.

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,240
Do you want to hang out later?

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
I've got plans.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,520
- Ooh, and what are your plans?
- Haven't decided yet.

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
Great. I'm looking forward
to hanging out later then.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Oh, I still can't believe
she called me "uptight."

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,920
- Seriously.
- Well, you do over-analyze stuff.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,680
- Oh! Oh, so you agree with her?
- No! No!

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,280
Well, you are a bit rigid at times,
don't you think?

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm not rigid. I am...

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm totally chill.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,840
- Okay.
- In fact, I'm going to show you both

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
just how chill I am.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm going to have a small gathering
of friends at my house tonight.

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
- A party?
- No, a small gathering.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
And I'm gonna cook a roast chicken.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,600
Don't cook a roast chicken.
Cooking a roast chicken is not chill.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,640
Okay? Who are you going to invite?
You don't have any friends.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
- Yes, I do.
- Who?

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,240
I have you and...

74
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,040
- Lily.
- Lily? Is Lily your friend?

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,320
Yes, she is. I helped her vagina open up.

76
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,080
- But don't repeat that, it's confidential.
- Clients are not friends, Otis.

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,520
Fine. You invite Rahim
and some of your Swing Band friends.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,800
I'll invite you and Lily, and we can have
a totally spontaneous,

79
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,000
super-small, chill gathering
at my house tonight.

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Without a chicken?

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Without a chicken.

82
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
Hey, Lily. How are you doing?

83
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,840
I have to be somewhere else.

84
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,440
Otis, you can't be mad at both of them.

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,040
I can. Maeve ruined my relationship,

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,680
- and Ola broke up with me, so...
- Uh, that's a little extreme.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,000
- You should invite Maeve to your party.
- No, it's a small gathering.

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,160
Uh, you can have a couple of drinks,
clear the air. I know you want to.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,680
I do not want her there.

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,760
I feel bad about Maeve.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,480
We spoke about this, Steve.
She was too much of a risk

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,560
and she doesn't take this seriously.
At least Paulina is reliable.

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,800
I can hear you.

94
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,280
Hey, Viv. I loved that meme
you sent me last night.

95
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
- It was hilarious.
- I know. Cats playing Scrabble,

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
gets me every time.

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Polly.

98
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
Prawn cocktail?

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
No.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
I can't deal with the smell of fish
before lunch.

101
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
- Anyway, how long until the heat?
- Um...

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,200
We have 25 minutes of free time
before the minibus leaves.

103
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,360
- Great. I might go and do some push-ups.
- Okay. I'll get on with some practice.

104
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,840
I am going to go to the bathroom.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Polly, I can smell it from here.

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,040
<i>Party at Otis Milburn's tonight.</i>

107
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Okay. Party at Otis Milburn's tonight.

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,600
- But it's a Thursday.
- BYO booze.

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
We can't be hungover at rehearsals.

110
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,600
Hi. Um, party at Otis Milburn's tonight.

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
It's a Thursday.

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,120
- Thursday's the new Friday.
- No, Wednesday is the new Saturday.

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,680
- Everybody knows that.
- Can I come to the party?

114
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,360
No, Rahim. I've disgraced us.

115
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,280
I didn't realize you were going, Rahim.
Uh, where's Otis's house then?

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,960
Uh, 43 Ashford Street.

117
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,800
BYO booze.

118
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,840
Bye. Your hair is majestic.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
You're not actually going
to a party on a Thursday, are you?

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,320
Thursdays are the new Fridays, Olivia.
Get with the program.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
My boyfriend wants to have anal sex.

122
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,040
I told him I've done it before,
but I haven't, and I'm freaking out.

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,480
Okay, well, um...

124
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,680
what exactly are you afraid of?

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
I don't know how to douche.

126
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,296
I've looked it up online.
Every website says something different.

127
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,600
Listen to me,

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
I cannot, under any circumstances,
shit myself.

129
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,600
Let me do some research,
and I'll get back to you.

130
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Also, I'm having a small gathering
of friends at my house tonight,

131
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,616
- if you'd like to come...
- What the fuck's a "small gathering"?

132
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,160
It's... a small group...

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,096
- Be quick with the research, yeah?
- Hey.

134
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
Hey, guys. Um...

135
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,920
- weird question.
- Uh-huh.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
What do you know about anal douching?

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,520
Um, not much to be honest, Otis.

138
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,840
I know about this, I'll teach you.

139
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720

Are you okay in there?

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,840

Paulina's got food poisoning,

152
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
- and she wasn't very good anyway.
- It's true, you were so much better.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,040
She always said "pacific"
instead of "specific,"

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
and didn't know
marsupials have pouches.

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,680
Okay, fine. Please will you come back?
But you can't go rogue, okay?

156
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,080
Jean speaking.

157
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,960
<i>Hello, Jean.
It's Michelle Lawson, Remi's agent.</i>

158
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,560
<i>- Long time no speak.</i>
- Hello, Michelle.

159
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
<i>I'm calling because
Remi mentioned the possibility</i>

160
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
<i>of you two writing together again.</i>

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,680
<i>Something about teenagers

162
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>Sounds fascinating.</i>

163
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,280
Well, firstly, my research is confidential
and secondly, Remi is grossly mistaken.

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,520
I will not be writing with him again.

165
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
<i>Oh, why not?</i>

166
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,200
Because he is a colossal twat.

167
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
- Oh, hello, Ola.
- Hi.

168
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,840
Have a seat.

169
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
So, Dad told me
you guys aren't seeing each other anymore.

170
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Well, at least...

171
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,640
it might make it easier
for you and Otis now.

172
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,640
Oh, we broke up too.

173
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,960
He didn't tell you?

175
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,680
Well, he doesn't tell me much
these days, and...

176
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,200
Well, sometimes I wonder if
it would've been easier if I'd had a girl.

177
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Girls can be pretty annoying too.

178
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
You know, if you ever need
to talk to a woman about anything...

179
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,800
What would you do
if you really liked someone,

180
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,920
and you were so sure they liked you too,

181
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
but all of a sudden they're acting like
they find you completely revolting?

182
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,760
Douching is not essential

183
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,520
if you eat a lot of fiber
and empty your bowels regularly.

184
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,120
- Huh.
- Hmm.

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
If you've never douched before,
it might be best

186
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,960
to start with a simple bulb, like that.

187
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,760
So, water in the bulb...

188
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,040
If I'm not cooking a roast chicken,
what are people going to eat?

189
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
Crisps.

190
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
Otis, just crisps.

191
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,560
...for as long as you can,
sit on the toilet...

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,000
and release.

193
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,000
- What about dips?
- No dips.

194
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,000
- But my guac is...
- Just listen to Rahim.

195
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,880
...and protective mucus in your anus.

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
- Boys!
- Hey!

197
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,760
Let's see the hand.

198
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,640
- Glad to have you back, Marchetti.
- Cheers, man.

199
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Sir,

200
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,000
my cast came off this morning
and I'm back training this week.

201
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,680
Amazing news. Congratulations.

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,400
So, I'm not gonna be able
to make dress rehearsals tomorrow night.

203
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,520
Jackson, this is show business, all right?

204
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
Not no-show business.
Just rearrange training.

205
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,040
It's my mum, sir. She wants me
back in the pool as soon as possible.

206
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm sure she'll understand.
It's great to have more than one passion.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,360
Talk to her, okay?

208
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,320
Squat, don't rush,
push it in, compress the bulb.

209
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
Pull to take it out.

210
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
What's going on?

211
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm teaching Otis how to douche.

212
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,640
- But we're leaving, actually.
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

213
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,800
Okay.

214
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,160
Thank you.

215
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,960
Squeeze, hold, release.

216
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
- I'll pick you up at your house.
- I can meet you at the party.

217
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,200
- Small gathering.
- Yeah, but I wanna see where you live.

218
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
Okay.

219
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
What's the matter?

220
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,040
I've just never had anyone
meet my family before.

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,920
I still think that you should invite her.

222
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,720
No.

223
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,136
- What...
- No. I'll see you later.

224
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't want to see any roast chicken!

225
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
Hey, Maeve.

226
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,520
Um, I think you should come
to Otis's party tonight.

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,560
- I didn't get an invite.
- But I know he wants you there.

228
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,800
I think that you two really need to talk.

229
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,360
He didn't mean what he said in the text.

230
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,760
Please? Just talk to him.

231
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll think about it, okay?

232
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Okay.

233
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
See you later. Bye.

234
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay.

235
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
What are you...

236
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,840
Okay, what are you doing, Mum?
What are you doing?

237
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Ooh!

238
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,320
- Otis.
- Mum.

239
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm just, uh...

240
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,960
- I was waiting for you to get back.
- Oh.

241
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm thinking of having
some friends over tonight.

242
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Oh.

243
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,920
- A party?
- No.

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Just a gathering.

245
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,680
Um... But I was thinking
maybe if you could not be there?

246
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,480
Oh. Oh, I see. Uh, yeah.

247
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
It's not personal.

248
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,720
- No.
- It's just...

249
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
- Of course not.
- You know?

250
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
You're asserting your independence
from your primary care giver.

251
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
It's perfectly normal.

252
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,240
I will make myself scarce.

253
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,880
- Otis?
- Yeah?

254
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,520
You know you can talk to me
about anything?

255
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah, I know.

256
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,320
<i>♪ Betrayal takes two
Who did it to who? ♪</i>

257
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,040

What are you doing tonight?

267
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,840
Remember, whoever wins this heat
gets a place in the televised finals,

268
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,640
where all your friends, families,
and university recruiters

269
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,760
will get a chance to see your giant brains
in widescreen high definition.

270
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,800
Maeve, you are not a lone wolf.
We play as a team today.

271
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
A winning team.

272
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Okay.

273
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
I talked to Coach earlier.
They said there's every chance

274
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
you could be back on track
for the Nationals.

275
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Obviously, we'll take it slowly, but...

276
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,280
Well, maybe Jackson doesn't want
to talk about swimming right now.

277
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
You mean <i>you </i>don't want to talk about it.

278
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,360
Uh, that's not what I said.

279
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,560
- It's what you're implying.
- Everything's fine, okay? I'm fine,

280
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,720
the hand's fine, everything is fine.
Let's just drop it, okay?

281
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
I'll get it.

282
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,800
Lovely to meet you, Mrs. Effiong.

283
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,320
Ooh.

284
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,840
- Eric, who is your friend?
- I'm Eric's boyfriend.

285
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,840
Oh.

286
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,040
- Lovely to meet you...
- Rahim.

287
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,200
Rahim.

288
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,000
Eric, why didn't you say
you had a boyfriend?

289
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,520
- Would you like to come in...
- No, no, no! Mum, we're in a rush,

290
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
and we need to go now.

291
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,600
Don't be late. It's a Thursday.

292
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,880
- Your family know you're gay, right?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,280
I came out when I was 13.

294
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,320
So, why don't you tell your parents
about me then?

295
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,120
Well, we're just
not a very talkative family.

296
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,800
Come on. We're gonna be late.

297
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,256
- We're gonna be late?
- Yeah, we're gonna be late.

298
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah, late.

299
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,040
Last question,
and for a place in the final,

300
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,160
according to the Department of Health,

301
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,400
what is the most common drug
used in the UK?

302
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,080
Ibuprofen.

303
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,120
Incorrect.

304
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,120
Fuck.

305
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,760
Quiz Heads, over to you.

306
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
I think it's marijuana.

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,680
It's not a legal drug.
It's paracetamol, trust me.

308
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,080
Weed.

309
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
The answer is...

310
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
paracetamol.

311
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,680
And the Moordale Quiz Heads
are through to the final.

312
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
- Yes! Get in!
- Come on!

313
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Well done.

314
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,480
I definitely would have said weed.

315
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
Have you ever done magic mushrooms?

316
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm not sure I should answer that.

317
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,880
When the others arrive,
I'll put out the rest of the snacks.

318
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,600
Maybe we can play some charades.

319
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,560
So, did Eric invite you?

320
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,800
I heard there was a big party
at your house.

321
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,240
I thought I might get to hang out
with your mum.

322
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Oh, God.

323
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,040
That must be Eric.

324
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
I told him to bring a cheese board.

325
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,240
- Hi, Debbie. Hi.
- You all right?

326
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,200
Oh, yeah. Okay, um...

327
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,560
Oh, um...

328
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,800
Excuse me, um...

329
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,360
What? Oh, God!

330
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,480
I can't believe it.

331
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
Who's gonna be there?

332
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,640
Well, I hope Jamie and Joel.

333
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,600
- Who even told you about Otis's party?
- Trom-boner.

334
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Adam?

335
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,640
Didn't you get expelled?

336
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,120
I heard he has a huge dick.

337
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Thanks, Adam.

338
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,320
- Hi, my babies.
- Hi, Mum.

339
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,880
You been crying?

340
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Huh?

341
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
Allergies.

342
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,640
These bloody plants
are trying to kill me, I think.

343
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,600
Good job they're pretty, eh?

344
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,800
How was school?

345
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
I got back on the quiz team.
And we're going to the finals.

346
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh.

347
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,520
And I have two tickets for family.

348
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,440
And it would mean a lot
if you could be there.

349
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,520
- Yeah, of course I'll be there.
- Cool.

350
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,080
Why are you all dressed up?

351
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm going to a party.

352
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,160
Who's the boy then?

353
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,440
No, there's no boy, Mum.

354
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,800
- I'll see you later.
- What's his name?

355
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,840
Stop it! There's no boy.

356
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,200
- Bye, Els.
- Mmm.

357
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Stop!

358
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Bye.

359
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,520
- I thought you were busy tonight.
- I am.

360
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,040
- I'm going to a party.
- Can I come?

361
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
No.

362
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You don't know what you're missing.
I'm really fun at parties,

363
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
people can't get enough of me.

364
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,080
- I thought we were friends now.
- What?

365
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
What made you think that?

366
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm not spending another night
stuck inside with my brother.

367
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,040
Seriously,
my brain's a precious commodity,

368
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
and it's slowly dying from boredom.

369
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't let it die, Maeve.

370
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Please? Please?

371
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, my God. Okay, fine!

372
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,400
- Do I have time to change my shirt?
- No.

373
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,920
Also, all of our brains are slowly dying.
You're not unique.

374
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Oh, my goodness.
I'm terrible at making decisions.

375
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,400
I usually just have what Michael's having.

376
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,640
I mean,

377
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I used to have what Michael was having.

378
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,680
Well, do what I do sometimes:
close your eyes and point.

379
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,880
- Okay.
- It works.

380
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
What can I get you?

381
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'll have a three-legged monkey, please.

382
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
Oh!

383
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,120
- And you?
- I'll have one of those too.

384
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
Thank you.

385
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, being on your own
will get easier, I promise.

386
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,920
Before you know it, you'll be wondering
how you ever shared the TV remote.

387
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I hope so.

388
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
How's your... man friend?

389
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,200
Um... we split up, actually.

390
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?

391
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,040
I think I realized I'd become
too independent for relationships.

392
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Hmm.

393
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,240
I sometimes get worried
that I'm going to end up

394
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,600
- like my poor old Auntie Gladys.
- What happened to her?

395
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,920
She choked to death on a microwave dinner.

396
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,440
- What?
- Nobody found her for two weeks.

397
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Really?

398
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

399
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,560
Well, here's to Auntie Gladys then.

400
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,800
To Auntie Gladys.

401
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,760
<i>♪ Life is so strange when you don't know ♪</i>

402
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,800

403
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,920

404

<i>♪ Something could change

405
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

406
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,160
- Eric? Hi! I am going to kill you.
- Hey.

407
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,080
Why? I didn't invite this many people.

408
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,360
- Is Ola here?
- Why would Ola be here?

409
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,776
- We have broken up.
- Okay. I thought the whole point of this

410
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,560
was for you to show Ola that you're chill.

411
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,680
- Should I get you both drinks?
- Yeah.

412
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Yeah, Otis needs a drink. Okay, dude.
Dude...

413
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,480
this is the closest to cool in sixth form
you're ever gonna get.

414
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,720
Enjoy it, okay?

415
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,680
En-joy-ment.

416
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,960
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

417
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,240
Chin-chin.

418
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Ooh.

419
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

420
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
Well,

421
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,560
this isn't exactly disability-friendly,
is it?

422
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,456
- Yeah, well you wanted to come.
- And you didn't think about these stairs

423
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,160
versus wheelchair situation.

424
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,120
- Let's just go home.
- I'm not going home.

426
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm here to par-tay.

427
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,480
But that does mean you're gonna
have to carry me down these stairs.

428
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,800
- Are you joking?
- Does it look like I'm joking?

429
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
Hello, kind sir.

430
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,160
Would you be so generous as to escort me

431
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,680
and my chair down these ridiculous steps?

432
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,720
- I just had a cast taken off, so I can't.
- No, it's fine.

433
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm sensing a hint of tension here.

434
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
Did you guys used to go out or something?

435
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,280
- So, who broke whose heart?
- Shut up, Isaac.

436
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Boys.

437
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,640
- Could you give us a hand getting...
- Isaac.

438
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,240
- ...Isaac a lift downstairs, please?
- Sure.

439
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,480
- Enjoy the party, Isaac.
- Grab a corner, boys. One, two...

440
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,880
So, I'm assuming it was you
who was the breaker of hearts then.

441
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,040
Okay, we're done here.

442
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,416
Hey, Jackson! Are you looking forward
to the dress rehearsal tomorrow?

443
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,280
- Oh, man. You...
- Mate,

444
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,160
he's not doing that gay Shakespeare shit.

445
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,720
Look, he's back in the pool.

446
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,880
Ruby is looking banging tonight.

447
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
You could never.

448
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
Fuck off, Marchetti.

449
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,720
Dex is here.

450
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,280
- Um, hi.
- I don't have time for "hi".

451
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,456
I know I need to go talk to him,
but I don't know how.

452
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Well, just go up to him and say,
"Hey, Dex," and ask him about his day

453
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,880
or a game that he likes

454
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,120
or another nerdy-type thing
you lot like talking about.

455
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,080
Then you keep chatting
and see where the night takes you. Easy.

456
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,120
Be yourself, all right?
And you'll be fine.

457
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,800
I just realized that your cast is gone.
That's great news.

458
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
Yeah, back to prison for me.

459
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,160
I'm joking. Go and get your man.

460
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,280
- Is that Maeve? Why is Maeve here?
- I kind of invited her.

461
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,720
- What?
- You guys need to talk.

462
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm not talking to her.
She can talk to me.

463
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,280
Who is that guy?

464
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,840
- No idea.
- This isn't really my scene, to be honest.

465
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,240
What's your scene then?

466
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,480
Uh... I don't know.
Reading a book somewhere alone.

467
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,560
People need people.

468
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,200
Is that another NA motivational quote
by any chance?

469
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,840
No, more of a core value, actually.

470
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,800
Who's the intense starey guy?

471
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,640
That's Otis.

472
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,800
It's his party. Things are a bit weird
between us right now.

473
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,680
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

474
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,160
But you wanted him to be your boyfriend?

475
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,160
- You're not actually psychic, you know.
- But I'm pretty close, right?

476
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,440
Don't tell me, you didn't think
he would be my type.

477
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,520
No, I think he's exactly your type.

478
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,280
I bet he's funny and charming
in a sweet, non-threatening way.

479
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,240
In fact, he looks a little bit like me,

480
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,240
but less interesting, which means
I must really, really be your type then.

481
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,800
Shut up!

482
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,480
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

483
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,240
- This is my friend, Isaac.
- Hiya, Isaac.

484
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,096
- Why are you in a wheelchair?
- Babes, no.

485
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,680
- You're not supposed...
- It's fine.

486
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,320
It was a horrendous incident
involving the wind.

487
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Fuck off.

488
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
Forty-three quintillion
possible combinations, but in theory,

489
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,120
it can be solved in just 20 moves.

490
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,320
Interesting.

491
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,920
Uh, Viv, can I ask you something?

492
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,000
Which is your favorite color?

493
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh, probably seafoam green.

494
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
No, on the cube?

495
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,640
Sometimes when I'm in the supermarket...

496
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,000
- Mm.
- ...I like looking at people...

497
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,920
Mm.

498
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,920
...and imagine having sex with them.

499
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,920
Oh.

500
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,040
Last week,

501
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,080
I had this fantasy about the man
who teaches my Zumba class.

502
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,600
And then, what... So what was the fantasy?

503
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,920
I was on the dance floor...

504
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,800
and he was standing up at the bar.

505
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,200
- We caught eyes.
- Oh.

506
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
And then,

507
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,240
all of a sudden, we're having rampant sex

508
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,200
at the back of the dance floor.

509
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,400
- Oh, we should go dancing.
- It was only a fantasy.

510
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,760
No, I know but let's go dancing.

511
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

512
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,200
- Let's go dancing.
- Let's go dancing.

513
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Dancing.

514
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,560
I didn't know you were having a party.

515
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,240
- You didn't invite me.
- Oh, hi, Ola.

516
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,960
It was very spontaneous.

517
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,320
Just... casual. It was a chill decision.

518
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,440
- You know.
- You said you wanted me to come

519
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,840
and pick up some stuff.

520
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,840
Yes, I... Yeah, so...

521
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,600
You left a T-shirt.

522
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,120
And a... mug with our faces on it
that you bought me.

523
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,480
I don't want it anymore.

524
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Okay.

525
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,960
- And some tools. Your dad left tools.
- Okay.

526
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,400
It's upstairs.

527
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,696
About that research.

528
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,360
Nick wants to go home and have sex
because your party's pathetic,

529
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,240
and I cannot have
an unclean arsehole, okay?

530
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,800
- Sure. I spoke with Rahim about it.
- You told Rahim?

531
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,000
I did not tell Rahim about you, okay?

532
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
I am a very professional.

533
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Rahim said...

534
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Rahim said...

535
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Rahim said...

536
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
You squat.

537
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
You squat.

538
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
And release.

539
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
I think you should go.

540
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
- I live here.
- I don't care.

541
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Okay.

542
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm gonna get another drink.
This one has sick in it.

548

- Why do you keep avoiding me?
- I'm not.

549
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Listen,

550
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,040
I'm sorry about the kiss thing.
I didn't mean to upset you.

551
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,680
Can we just go back
to the way we were before?

552
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,440
I don't think we can be friends anymore.

553
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,120
It's too confusing.

554
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360

Lily!

556
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,400
Marchetti,
I'm gonna smash you in practice this week.

557
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, fuck.

558
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,960
Ooh.

559
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,920
There you are.
You need to rescue me from Dex.

560
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,080
What you doing?

561
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,160
I did it to myself.

562
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,720
I put my hand under the weight
because I wanted it to stop,

563
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,680
and then it did stop
and it felt amazing, but now...

564
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,720
it's starting again, and it feels like
my head's about to explode

565
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,600
if it doesn't stop.
I just need it to stop, like...

566
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,320
- What to stop?
- This fucking pressure.

567
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,400
It's okay.

568
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,200
But you can't keep on hurting yourself.

569
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,800
What are you gonna say happened this time?

570
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,840
That I got into a fight.

571
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,600
But I didn't do it, so...

572
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,200
And I'm not gonna do it, right?
I know it was dumb, so...

573
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,800
Sorry, I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

574
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
You need to tell your parents
what you did.

575
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,000
Don't be stupid.
They would never understand.

576
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,200
I'm not being stupid.

577
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,800
Statistically, people that self-harm
are nine times more likely

578
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,320
to attempt taking their own lives.
You need to get professional help.

579
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,960
I don't need professional help.

580
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,320
I just need to tell them
that I'm not doing what they want anymore.

581
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,960
You self-harm, Jackson.

582
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,696
- And the statistics show...
- I don't care

583
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
about your fucking statistics, Viv!

584
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,800
What is wrong with you?

585
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,400
You say you don't have
any friends because you're busy,

586
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
but it's actually because
you're a fucking robot.

587
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,320
Thanks a lot, Jackson.

588
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200

that you've suddenly changed?

656
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,600

and I can't be in that place anymore.

- I'm scared.

659
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,960
And I think I'm bisexual.

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,520

00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,040

682
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Um, so, this is Ola.

683
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,480
I don't know if you know her.
She's well, quite little and...

684
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,120
and funny, and interesting, and pretty,
and she was my girlfriend

685
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,280
until she told me
I can't see Maeve anymore.

686
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,960
Now, we all know Maeve. Scary Maeve.

687
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,800
You know, she's not actually scary.
She's just pretending.

688
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,360
Anyway...

689
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,000
Maeve told me that she liked me, okay?

690
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,600
And I like Maeve.

691
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,960
I like Maeve a lot,
a lot more than I liked Ola.

692
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,600
- Otis. Otis, get off...
- But I was trying to be a good boyfriend,

693
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,480
so I said to Maeve,
"Sorry, I can't see you anymore."

694
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,240
And then, Ola dumped me.

695
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,160
Yeah, it's confusing. I was confused.

696
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,720
But I thought probably a good thing

697
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,600
'cause I just really wanted to be
with Maeve.

698
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,840
And I didn't really want to be with Ola,
and then I realized

699
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,560
Maeve Wiley just likes playing
with people's feelings,

700
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,096
and she doesn't care
about anyone else.

701
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,840
Like, she brought this... man with her.

702
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I don't know, probably just here
to make me jealous.

703
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,800
- Definitely didn't work.
- It definitely did.

704
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
All in all,

705
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,360
I think she's probably
the most selfish person I've ever met.

706
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,360
And I think it's good
that I'm not going out with either of them

707
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,360
because I think I deserve
a whole lot more.

708
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,080
Thank you for coming. Good night.

709
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,160
Not good night. Stay, enjoy yourselves.

710
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Music on, please!

711
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,680
You're welcome to him.

712
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,600
- What is her problem?
- You're an arsehole.

713
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Hey!

714
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,360
Eh-oooh!

715
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,000
Shall we go, An?

716
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,840
Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna stay
for a bit, actually.

717
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,000
Okay, alright.

718
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,200
Hey, um...

719
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,600
I hope I didn't put any pressure on you
about having sex.

720
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,680
We don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

721
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,200
No, yeah, I know. Thanks.

722
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,840
Right. Well, I'll see you later.

723
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,960
Okay. See you.

724
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Nick?

725
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,400
I do want to have sex with you.

726
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,920
I've just never done it before.

727
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,440
And I don't know how to douche.

728
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
You should have said.

729
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,880
Anwar, I didn't know how to do
any of that stuff either.

730
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,000
I'll show you if you want?

731
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,720
- Okay.
- Okay?

732
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,120

Jesus.

735
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,520
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't want to go home.

736
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,240

737
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,400

No wind, or youths,
or Afghan dogs this time.

763
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
All right.

764
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,840
- Um... Yeah, I was ten.
- Mm-hmm.

765
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,360
Joe and I
were still living with our parents.

766
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,160
They would send us out
so they could get high.

767
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,480
Anyway, on this particular day,
I dared Joe to climb up this massive tree,

768
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,320
and he chickened out halfway up.

769
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,680
So, of course,
I wanted to prove that I was braver

770
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
and get all the way up to the top,

771
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,560
which I did.

772
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,320
And then I fell.

773
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,520
That's it. That's the story.

774
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,320
Do you blame your parents?

775
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,800
No.

776
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,160
I sometimes blame them for not sticking
with the parenting thing, though.

777
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,120
Yeah, that bit kind of sucked.

778
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,680
Okay, well, I've got one for you.

779
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,720
Behold. I was eight.

780
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,800
My mum didn't take me to school.
She used to sleep a lot back then.

781
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,120
I tried to make myself beans on toast.

782
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
My brother had to call an ambulance.

783
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,440
Must've been some hot beans.

784
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Yeah.

785
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,880
Anyway, that's mine.

786
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,000
That Otis guy
wouldn't understand this shit.

787
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,480
He wouldn't get it.
It's not in his little world.

788
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,240
- Otis has got family problems too.
- That's different.

789
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,456
If you grow up knowing the people
who are meant to make sure you survive

790
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,520
just left you...

791
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,000
it leaves a lot of scars.

792
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,800
But those scars make you special.

793
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,800
And you and I are properly special.

794
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,840
And for the record, I'm sorry
about what I said about your mum.

795
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,080
