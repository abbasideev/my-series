What are you learning in that class?

Your fingers are all wrong.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
You're so picky, Mum.

do it well.

Who's that?

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,920
Um, it's my dance partner.
We're having extra rehearsals together.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
- I already told you.
- Yes, but I...

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't stop and talk.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
Remember, she thinks
your parents are Indian.

Hi, Mrs. Hanan, it's nice to meet you.

- Sorry.

- You all right, love?

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,760
Yeah, I just need
to get off the bus, please.

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,400

What the shit is this?

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,280
It's my magician's hankie.

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,240
You're not a fucking magician, Jeffrey.

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,240
- Maeve.
- Yeah?

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,600
You know what today is, don't you?

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Rent day.

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, yeah,
Uh, I'll get that to you later today.

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Oh.

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
Such a sweet boy.

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,760
Apparently, it was a terrible incident.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
He was attacked... by a gang of youths.

63
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,160
Shouldn't be so nosy, Cynthia.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
Magic that hankie to the bin, Jeffrey.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Twat.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,920
- Michael.
- What?

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
He <i>is </i>trying.

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,520
Sorry, Dad.

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,560
I've got you a trial shift at Brown's
this evening at eight.

70
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
He's doing me a favor so do not be late.

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,360
Why are you wearing a scarf?

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
- Is that for Rahim?
- No.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,920
- No. I just like scarves, okay?
- Uh-huh.

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,856
- Dude, why is your mum still here?
- I don't know.

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,760
- She lives here, apparently.
- Hello, Eric.

76
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
- Hello, darling.
- Don't address me at school, Mum.

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,400
Oh, don't forget dinner tonight.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,280
It's okay, that's it. You can go back
to pretending I don't exist.

79
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,960
What's dinner tonight?

80
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Dinner tonight is me,
my mum, Ola, and Jakob

81
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,160
all getting to know each other
like a big happy family.

82
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,240
I can't believe
you finally get a girlfriend

83
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,080
and she's basically your sister.
LOLs. LOLs.

84
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,280
Oh, you don't think
anyone will tell your mum

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,880
about the whole sex clinic thing though,
do you?

86
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
'Cause that'll be awkward.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Innit?

88
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,960
Everyone's gonna talk to your mum?

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,760
No one will talk to my mum
about anything...

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,680
- Yeah, especially not...
- Good morning, Eric.

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,640
- Morning, Rahim.
- I like your scarf.

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,320
Oh, this? Forgot I had it on.

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,560
Could I ask you something?

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Yeah.

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Hmm.

96
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,640
Oh, yeah. Um...

97
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
All right, yeah, I'll just go inside.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,560
- Yeah, okay. Cool.
- Okay.

99
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Um...

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,240
I was wondering if you would like
to go out with me sometime?

101
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,280
What? Like, on... on a date?

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah. Maybe tonight?

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
Y-Yes, sure.

104
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,000
Cool, I'll be there.

105
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,560
Cool, um, you decide what we do,

106
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,920
'cause I don't know what's cool to do
in this town.

107
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,280
Ooh.

108
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,080
- You auditioning for the play?
- Yeah, I'm going up for Juliet.

109
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Who's that?

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,080

Lily, hi. Uh, question.

126
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,360
Did you just... You didn't tell my mum
about the whole, you know, my...

127
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Being a sex wizard?

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Yeah.

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,720
No. It didn't come up.

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,360
- What are you looking at?
- My mum.

131
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,280
- It's my mum.
- Wow, she's really getting to you.

132
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
I don't trust her.

133
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,600
So dinner tonight's gonna be interesting.

134
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,000
We don't have to go.
How about we tell them we're not going?

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,800
Come on. At least they're trying
to make it less weird.

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,160
If it gets too much, we can just go
to your room and play <i>Smash Bros.</i>

137
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
- Okay.
- Okay?

138
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
- Yes, okay. Um...
- Awesome.

139
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
I'll see you later.

140
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,680
- I need to see Otis.
- Okay.

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,640
Uh, no, we don't do discounts.

142
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,840
It's all I've got
until I get my pocket money.

143
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,760
You have a sex problem,
but you still get pocket money?

144
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,360
Well, we're not a charity, okay?

145
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,360
So come back with the cash,
and I'll book you in.

146
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
New client?

147
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,000
No.
Got a couple tomorrow though.

148
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Look, um...

149
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,360
I think my mum being on campus
might be bad for business.

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
- I think you're being paranoid.
- You don't know my mum, all right?

151
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
She says she's just doing research.

152
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Before you know it,
she's in everyone's head.

153
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Okay. We'll keep an eye on it.

154
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,960
Happy birthday!

155
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,800
I baked a cake!

156
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,400
- Why didn't you say it was your birthday?
- Because I hate birthdays.

157
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,160
No one hates birthdays, Maeve.

158
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Why celebrate the day I got pushed out
of some random vagina against my will?

159
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,760
Think of all those gems
of nihilistic wisdom

160
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360
the world would be missing
if you hadn't been born.

161
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,120
Happy birthday, oh, joyous one.

162
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,720
Just tell him you like him, already.

163
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,760
So, what do you wanna do
for your birthday?

164
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Nothing.

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,920
What happened to this cake, exactly?

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Oh, it didn't look so bad before,

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
but then I was on the bus,
and a guy wanked on my leg,

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,840
and I got a bit of a shock,
and I smushed the cake.

169
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
What?

170
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,240
Do you think it'll stain?

171
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
I love these jeans.

172
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
You... you have to report it.

173
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
It's fine, they were only cheap.

174
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
No, you've been assaulted.

175
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,800
I think he was just lonely,
or not right in the head or something,

176
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,920
which is weird
'cause he was quite handsome.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
Aimes, this is serious.

178
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,520
It's silly. I'm fine, honestly.

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Okay. I know what I want to do
for my birthday.

180
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,160
I want us to go to the police.

181
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,760
Where did you take Ola on your first date?

182
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Um... we didn't really go on any dates.

183
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,760
Just started hanging out.

184
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
What do you mean?

185
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,760
You know, like playing video games,

186
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,080
talking, eating cereal.

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,640
Otis, that's what you and me do.

188
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes, except I don't kiss you.

189
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,840
I think French people
like to go on proper dates.

190
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,720
- Where should I take him?
- Okay, just don't stress.

191
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,680
Just as long as you guys are together,
I don't think it matters.

192
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
I don't even know why I'm asking you.

193
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,360
You've never even been on a date.

194
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
<i>Juicy.</i>

195
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,680
How are your chats
with the students going?

196
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,000
Seems a little quiet.

197
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,560
It's... still early.

198
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Hmm.

199
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,640
I wanted to reiterate
that you have not been employed

200
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
at Moordale as a counselor.

201
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Yes.

202
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,040
You've made that more than clear.

203
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm only speaking to the students
about the curriculum.

204
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,880
If they ever come to speak to you,
that is.

205
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Welcome!

206
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
Hi, I'm here to talk about SRE stuff.

207
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,200
Yes, of course you are.
Please, have a seat,

208
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,240
and... could you possibly just
close the door on your way out, Mr. Groff?

209
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
Thank you!

210
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Right.

211
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,960
What's your name?

212
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
Malek Amir.

213
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,920
Malek Amir. Nice to meet you, Malek.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
I don't have to pay for this, do I?

215
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
No.

216
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
Right, so...

217
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,240
what do you feel the SRE curriculum
is currently missing?

218
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,480
Okay, so a friend of mine

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,560
is dating a girl
who keeps putting a pillow over his face

220
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
when they have sex.

221
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,520
Would the curriculum cover that, maybe?

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Interesting.

223
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,520
Adding fetish to the curriculum
could be a... a real asset.

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Fetish?

225
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,600
Yes, there are hundreds
of sexual fetishes, actually,

226
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,200
and, lo and behold,
they often start during puberty.

227
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,840
Well, you know,
covering a person's face during sex

228
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,040
could be anything
from a desire to engage in, well,

229
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,880
breath play, or even encasement fantasy,

230
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,120
or sometimes, although very rare,
ghost fetish.

231
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,840
- Ghost fetish?
- Yeah.

232
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,840
When one covers another's face
because they secretly have a desire

233
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
to engage in sexual activity
with a spirit or a ghost.

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,400
So my girlfriend's insane.

235
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,360
I thought you said
it was your friend's girlfriend?

236
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
I've gotta go.

237
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,400
Fascinating.

238
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,920
Wow. Who knew?

239
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,480
Do you wanna fuck a ghost?

240
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,680
What?

241
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,560
Well, whatever
your face-covering fetish is,

242
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,921
you need to sort it out,
because it's weird and it's scary

243
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,920
and it's just making me feel
just very unsafe.

244
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
I'll get a form
for you to fill in.

245
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,360
See, she's got a proper problem.

246
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,920
You've got a proper problem.

247
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,600
Pothole on the high street.
Bloody council.

248
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Come on, let's go.

249
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
It's basically like he sneezed on me
or something.

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,280
He came on you, Aimee. Yeah?

251
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Yeah.

252
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,120
Cum is kind of like a penis
having a sneeze.

253
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,360
Ugh! That means
when you swallow someone's cum,

254
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
it's like eating their snot.

255
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
Take a seat,
we'll be with you in a bit.

256
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,880
- Hi there, how can I help you?
- Hi.

257
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,440
This is my friend Aimee.
She got sexually assaulted on the bus.

258
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,560
I got jizz on my jeans.

259
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,720
I mean, we're probably wasting your time.

260
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,240
You're not wasting anyone's time,
all right?

261
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you need to call somebody?

262
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,720
Shit, do I need a lawyer?
Am I gonna get arrested?

263
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,240
No, sorry. I just meant, like,
your mum or someone.

264
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Oh, God, no.
She'll just make it into a drama.

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
Right. Take a seat,
fill out one of these forms,

266
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,320
and an officer will be with you
in a minute.

267
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,760
- Thank you.
- Uh, you forgot your cake.

268
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
Oh.

269
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,520
- Is it someone's birthday?
- Yeah, mine.

270
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,160
Oh, <i>feliz navidad.</i>

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,680
That means "merry Christmas."

272
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Hmm.

274
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,240
Men are so weird.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
I think he's cute.

276
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,200
Why do people always think
old men are cute?

277
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,560
How do you know he hasn't jizzed
on someone on a bus before?

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,120
I meant the lizard.

279
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,320
What's going on?

280
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,360
So... this year's school production

281
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

282
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,200
is not only gonna be a play, but also...

283
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,680
drum roll, please...

284
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,760
...a musical, yo!

285
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Huh?

286
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,480
Who's pumped? Who's pumped?
I'm pumped. Yeah?

287
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,480
It will be written and assistant-directed
by Swing Band's very own Lily Iglehart,

288
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,840
and auditions will be held
bright and early tomorrow morning.

289
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,800
Now, I've got a really special feeling
about this one, guys.

290
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,280
It's a chance for everyone
to really find their place... and shine.

291
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,800
Hey, you forgot your audition speech.

292
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,520
What is this I see?

293
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,880
Jackson Marchetti auditioning
for the lowly school play?

294
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,000
Will wonders never cease?

295
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't really understand Shakespeare,
sir, it doesn't make sense.

296
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,760
Well, that's the beauty
of will.i.am-bic pentameter.

297
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Okay, thanks.

298
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,880
Hello.

299
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,320
Uh, not history.

300
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,680
Oh, no, I'm Michael's wife, Maureen.

301
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,480
Oh. Sorry. Jean. Sex ed-ish.

302
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Hello.

303
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,600
It's Mr. Groff's dinner.
I drop it in on Wednesdays.

304
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,400
He works late, marking.

305
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,920
- How are you getting along?
- Good.

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Good, yeah.
Think I'm getting the hang of it.

307
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
Yes.

308
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,376
Michael used to come home
on the verge of tears most nights

309
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,840
during his first term as headmaster.

310
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Oh, don't tell him I said that.

311
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,120
Anyway, glad you're toughing it out.

312
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Thank you.

313
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,560
I... was wondering whether...

314
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,560
Yes, what is it?

315
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,920
I was wondering whether...

316
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,800
you could tell me where you got
that shade of lipstick from?

317
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,040
It's fabulous.

318
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
Well, I don't remember.

319
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,160
But next time you're here,

320
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
why don't you pop in
and I'll let you know?

321
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Great.

322
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,960
- Well, I better get Mr. Grumpy his food.
- Yes.

323
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,040
It's nice to meet you, Jean.

324
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,880
Nice to meet you too, Maureen.

325
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
Do you wanna hang at mine
before your date?

326
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
I can't. I haven't decided
what I'm gonna wear. What should I wear?

327
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
- Wow. How the tables have turned.
- Oh, Otis,

328
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
I don't have time for this conversation.
I have to go home

329
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
and try on everything I own.

330
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Well, maybe just lose the scarf.

331
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,680
Maybe lose your virginity?

332
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,080
Olivia, Jesus!

333
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
You could have killed yourself.

334
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Thanks to your mum,
my boyfriend thinks I wanna kill him.

335
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Why?

336
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Because I sometimes do this thing, okay,
where I cover his face with a pillow

337
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,760
just when I cum
and now your mum thinks I have a fetish.

338
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,240
- Which you don't?
- I have an ugly cum face, okay?

339
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,520
I've seen it in the mirror before.
It's bad.

340
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,640
I look like a python swallowing an egg,
and Malek always looks perfect.

341
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Well...

342
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,680
that's normal to feel observed
and vulnerable when you're having sex.

343
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
And he probably feels
just as silly sometimes, too.

344
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,440
We... we might think we look stupid
or unappealing,

345
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,840
but sex isn't always perfect
and it should be about feeling good,

346
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,760
not looking pretty.

347
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
It's a privilege
to see your partner like that.

348
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,280
So maybe you and your boyfriend
need to work on your trust,

349
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,600
so you can show him yourself fully,
like, all the bits.

350
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,800
Even the bits you think might be ugly,

351
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,600
'cause I bet he doesn't think they are
at all.

352
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
And...

353
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,800
there's something I think might help.

354
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,800
I got a B plus in algebra.

355
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,920
You know that's not very impressive?

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
So, do you want to do your English

357
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,560
or maths homework today?

358
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Well...

359
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,000
actually, I was thinking
of auditioning for the school play,

360
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,200
but I don't understand Shakespeare,
and I wondered if you could help me.

361
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,120
- Not my remit. Maths or English.
- Come on.

362
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Look, I'd never have got
a B plus in algebra if it wasn't for you.

363
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,000
And I'm sure you've got
some Shakespeare tricks up your sleeve?

364
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,480
Please.

365
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
You're not cute.

366
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,120
Why do you wanna audition anyway?

367
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,680
Well, I'm taking your advice
and getting a backup plan.

368
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,840
When I played Joseph
in my primary school Nativity,

369
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,280
people said I was very believable.

370
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
- Of course you played Joseph.
- Come on.

371
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,360
Please. You're a tutoring genius.

372
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Fine.

373
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,560
- But this is a one-time thing.
- Yeah.

374
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,960
Read me the speech.

375
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,480
- Now?
- Yeah.

376
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
All right.

377
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
All right.

378
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,920
"It is my lady, oh, it is my love,

379
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,136
- oh, that she knew she wor..."
- Why are you reading it

380
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,000
- like it's a shopping list?
- Because it makes no sense.

381
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
It's poetry.

382
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,560
Once you've got the rhythm,
the words take on meaning.

383
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,920
So, each line has ten syllables,
made up of five heartbeats.

384
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Ba-boom, ba-boom,
ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

385
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You try.

386
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,680
"Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon,

387
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,000
who is already sick and pale with grief."

388
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,240
So you've got the rhythm and the words.

389
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,800
Now you need the emotion.

390
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,000
This speech is about love.

391
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,400
So, try thinking of someone
who makes you feel a lot when you say it.

392
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,280
Ooh.

393
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
Hope I get my jeans back.

394
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Do you really want them back, though?

395
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,560
Yeah, they're the perfect bootleg, Maeve.
You don't find that very often.

396
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,720
It's true.

397
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,480
- Do you think they're watching us?
- Yeah, probably.

398
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,880
- Oh!
- No.

399
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,320
- Aimee.
- I'm sorry, I'm really nervous.

400
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
That wasn't me.

401
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,800
Sorry, I fart when I'm scared.

402
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Okay.

403
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
All right...

404
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,840
Thanks for the jeans, Aimee.

405
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
Where were we?

406
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
So...

407
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,360
fair hair, clean-shaven,
five feet eight or nine...

408
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,760
and a blue jacket.

409
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,120
It was kind of aqua.

410
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,280
And was he already on the bus?

411
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Yeah.

412
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,800
I think so.

413
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,640
He might have got on at the second stop.

414
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
Well, it's really important to know
what stop he got on at

415
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
so we can get
as clear a picture as possible.

416
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,240
So you said you remember smiling at him.

417
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,920
Was that after the first stop
or the second?

418
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,560
Sorry,
what's that got to do with anything?

419
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,200
Are you saying
she shouldn't have smiled at him?

420
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
Charges like this
are really hard to convict,

421
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,680
and if we do actually catch the guy,
the questions are gonna get harder.

422
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,080
Can I have my jeans back, please?

423
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,240
I'm gonna go. I'm sorry to make a fuss.

424
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,160
Aimes, um...

425
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,080
...what if he does this
to someone else? I know you can do this.

426
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Please?

427
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,000
- You're doing brilliantly, Aimee.
- Yeah.

428
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,280
Just take your time.

429
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,320
Try to remember.

430
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,560
He was already on the bus.

431
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,760
How was your day at school, Ola?

432
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Good.

433
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
How was your day at school, Mum?

434
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,680
Having fun hanging out with all my peers?

435
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,280
It was very good, thank you.

436
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,840
- Dad.
- Hmm?

437
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,520
- Stop.
- Oh, sorry.

438
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,160
I eat like a pig sometimes.

439
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,920
I've been alone for too many years.

440
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
Hmm.

441
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,800
My mum's been single a long time too.
She doesn't eat like that.

442
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Otis!

443
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,280
Um...

444
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,640
this is delicious.

445
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Mmm.

446
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
You don't eat this?

447
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
Otis doesn't like fat.

448
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,240
Oh, really?

449
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,720
- Ah, um...
- Can I have it, then?

450
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,640
Do you have any more? No.

451
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,760
Thank you.

452
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,200
Fat is the best bits.

453
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Oh.

454
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,240
It's bad for your heart.

455
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,440
Really? It's not a proven fact.

456
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,720
Well, I disagree.

457
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm okay with that.

458
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Right.

459
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,560
Why don't we all take a deep breath

460
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,280
and tell each other
exactly how we're feeling?

461
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,080
Let's start by saying
the first words that come into our minds.

462
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Okay, I'll start. Annoyed.

463
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,480
Immature.

464
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Selfish.

465
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,080
Uncomfortable.

466
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Invasion.

467
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
Overly sensitive.

468
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,720
That's two words, Mum.

469
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,000
Monopoly.

470
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,000
Why don't we all play Monopoly instead?

471
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,360
You guys ready? Give you a lift.

472
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
Is the lizard going to jail?

473
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
No, his owner has Alzheimer's.

474
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,040
Forgets why he's here and then he forgets
to take this dude home.

475
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,600
Should we get some dinner, Neil,
and then we'll drop these two on the way?

476
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,160
Oh, don't worry. No need for a payment.

477
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,600
Um, enjoy your stay at my hotel.

478
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm paying you,
it's just I will have to remortgage.

479
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,800
No, you don't have to.
I have so much money, I don't need more.

480
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,760
Okay, that's not how the game works.

481
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm not breaking the rules.
Four hundred pounds, please.

482
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,480
I said it's fine.

483
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,120
I said it's not fine.

484
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
I don't want it.

485
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
I want you to have it.

486
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,880
Well, if we're playing by the rules,
you owe me £600.

487
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Six hundred.

488
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,120
Mmm...

489
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,000
- I think you're bankrupt.
- Fuck, I know I'm bankrupt!

490
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,760
Right, I'll make some tea.

491
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,520
Why? Why do we think
this is a normal situation?

492
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,960
Ola is my girlfriend,

493
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,760
you are not my dad,
and this is not a fucking family.

494
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,000
You shouldn't swear at your mother.

495
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,640
Thank you, Jakob,
but I don't need help parenting my child.

496
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,720
Okay. I think I should go home.

497
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Let you guys sort things out.

498
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,880
He's always...
He's here all the time, and I...

499
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
I'll see you at school.

500
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,120
I want you to go and apologize to Jakob
first thing in the morning.

501
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Sure, I mean,
I'm not gonna have to go anywhere,

502
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,800
considering he practically lives here.

503
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,280
I understand that you're angry.

504
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
But I'm happy with Jakob.

505
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,280
Why can't you be happy for me?

506
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,480
No, you're pretending to be happy, Mum.

507
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
You're not the relationship type.

508
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,920
Stop kidding yourself.

509
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,840
Or maybe you're just not as independent
as you thought.

510
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,240
Go to your room!

511
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm 16.

512
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Fine!

513
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,880
Well, then I'll go to mine!

514
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Hey.

515
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,880
You found it okay then?

516
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,440
Yeah. This town is very small, so, yeah.

517
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Cool.

518
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,040
Where did you get this cake?
Demand your money back.

519
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Aimee made it.

520
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,240
Oh, sorry, Aimee.
I'm just not used to some of the flavors.

521
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,400
Mmm, it's okay, it's my first cake.

522
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm gonna be a baker when I leave school.

523
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,360
Sounds like a good plan.

524
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,360
Uh, you having a birthday party?

525
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,560
No.

526
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
She hates birthdays.

527
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,440
Why? Birthdays are great.

528
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,400
Aren't you doing something nice
with your fella?

529
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

530
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,560
She is in love with a boy though.

531
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,240
She's just too afraid to tell him
how she feels,

532
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,720
which is stupid
because he clearly loves her back.

533
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,440
Shut up, Aimee, you don't know that.

534
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,320
I think you should tell him how you feel.
What have you got to lose?

535
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,600
Uh, um, sorry. I actually ordered
the special, the fishy something?

536
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,600
Vichyssoise, it's a chilled soup.

537
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
Steak's on the way.

538
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,200
Cool, great.

539
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,240
Mmm.

540
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,600
Mm-hmm. Hm-hmm. Hm-hmm.

541
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,560
- How's your soup?
- Um-hmm. It's cold.

542
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,480
It's cold, Rahim.

543
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Hmm.

544
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,520
Have you eaten here before?

545
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Um, my mum and dad came here
for their wedding anniversary, so...

546
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,600
I thought it would be nice.

547
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Let's go somewhere else.

548
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,320
- Where?
- Take me where you feel happy.

549
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,800
Uh, but... Well, we haven't paid.

550
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,040
Who cares?

551
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,520
You cannot live in fear.

552
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,640
- Oi!
- Huh? Yes, yeah.

553
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,600
This is for you, that is from me.

554
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,200
So, you just run the scanner
over the barcode, like so.

555
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,920
Ah.

556
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,560
Jessie's a rescue.

557
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,440
She's not trained, so don't let her out.

558
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,800
She'll just run off.

559
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,040
Okay. You show me now.

560
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,760
No way.
I'm not doing that, I'm really not.

561
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
No, Rahim, come on, it'll be fun.

562
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,120
No, I'm very bad at dancing.
I'm not doing that.

563
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,120
Look, you said take you somewhere
that makes me feel happy.

564
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040

581
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,080
You just kissed me.

582
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,200
Yes, Eric Effiong, I did.

583
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,120

Yes.

599
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,160
It's sexy here, right?
I live above a shop.

600
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,240
When did you get back?

601
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,400
None of your business, Tromboner.

603
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
We used to go to school together.

Um... Do you know what?

605
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Um...

606
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,520
it's a bit late,
and I need to get home, sorry.

607
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
Okay.

608
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
- You can see it another time.
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,120
Thank you for a beautiful night.

610
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,760
Oh, sorry.

611
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Okay.

612
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Bye.

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,680

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,120
Jackson?

616
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
Is this where you live?

617
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, this is me.

618
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,000
It's nice.

619
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,000
You'll let me know
when I can have my jeans back?

620
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,400
Absolutely. Thanks, Aimee.

621
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,840
Sorry for ruining your birthday.

622
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,360
Weirdly, one of the best birthdays
I've had in a long time.

623
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,200
- All right, bye!
- Bye.

624
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,960
- Aimee-maimee!
- Night, Mum!

625
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,000
No, no, how was your day?

626
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,680
Come in! Come in.

627
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,480
Come in and talk to me.

628
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,320
Oh, why are you wearing those trousers?

629
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,120
They're not flattering at all.

630
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,960
'Cause I lost my jeans.

631
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,240
How did you lose your jeans?

632
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,480
Well, I was on the bus...

633
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,280
and actually, I'm not really sure.

634
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,240
What about I make you a cheese toastie?
And you can fill me in on all the goss.

635
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,880
I always like to know
who's kissing who, and...

636
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm quite tired.

637
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,760
Oh. What about we watch a movie?

638
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,000
You know, something with,
um, Ryan Gosling.

639
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,240
He's so handsome.

640
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,840
Or is it Ryan Reynolds?

641
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,520
Which Ryan do I like?

642
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Gosling.

643
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,040
- I think I'm gonna go to bed.
- Oh.

644
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320

What happened to your face?

661
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,120
I told him I had other kids.
It didn't go down too well.

662
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Have.

663
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,400
You have other kids.

664
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,640
You're saving my life, Froggy.

665
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,960
Yeah, you can come in, but we're not
gonna pretend everything's okay,

666
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,400
'cause it's not.

667
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Got it.

668
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,040
Come on, darling.

669
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,640
I came to apologize to your dad.

670
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Hmm.

671
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,000
Okay. I'll go get him.

672
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,200
- Dad...
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,160
He just wants to talk to you.

674
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

675
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
My mum wanted me to come and apologize.

676
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,880
So, I'm sorry.

677
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,920
Well, there's no need to,

678
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,000
but thanks.

679
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,520
I already have a dad.

680
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I understand that.

681
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,120
It's all right.

682
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,840
Hey, you ready for school?

683
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,560
Yep. I guess.

684
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,880
Thank you. You have a good day now.

685
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,760
- See you, Dad.
- Bye-bye.

686
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,880
Everything all right?

687
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,040
Sorry, wrong bus.

688
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,080
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

689
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,560
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
or if thou will not, be but sworn my love,

690
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,040
and I'll no longer be a Capulet."

691
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,280
Okay. Thank you, Florence.

692
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,320
I haven't got to the good bit yet.

693
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,680
Juliet thinks she's in love
and then she dies. We get the gist.

694
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Next.

695
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,720
Ahh!

Jackson!

697
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,600
This is gonna be a train wreck.

698
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680

00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,720
who is already sick and pale with grief,

701
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,720
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

702
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,560
Be not her maid, for she is envious...

703
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,080
I think we've found our Romeo.

704
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,240
...is sick and green.

705
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,360
And none but fools do wear it.

706
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,440
Cast it off."

707
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,720
- How was the family dinner?
- Oh, God, disastrous.

708
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,360
How did your date go?

709
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,080
We... kissed.

710
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,680
- You kissed?
- We kissed, man!

711
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,960
- Actually?
- How sick is that?

712
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,320
- Yes! We kissed!
- Oh, Eric.

713
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,000
Can I walk you to lunch?

714
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,880
Yes. Yes.

715
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,440
- Yeah.
- Okay.

716
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,480
Hmm.

717
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Hey.

718
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
Hi.

719
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,920
- Maybe your mum is gonna be a problem.
- Yup.

720
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,520
How was the rest of your birthday?

721
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,440
Unexpected.

722
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Well...

723
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,800
I got you something.

724
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,440
- You got me a five-year diary?
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,960
And I ripped out all your birthday pages,

726
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,160
so you don't have to celebrate one
for another five years.

727
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,160
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

728
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,200
Um...

729
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,960
see you later.

730
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Otis...

731
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,440
uh, I think...

732
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,240
I think...

733
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
What?

734
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
