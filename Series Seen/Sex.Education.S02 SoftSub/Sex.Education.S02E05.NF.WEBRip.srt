1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,640
So, it's set in a futuristic Australia

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,280
where nothing makes sense.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,480
Tank Girl's first words were
"cauliflower penis."

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
I don't get it.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,760
You're not meant to. It's surreal.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,160
I'm really glad we're okay now.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,440
What's that noise?

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,480
It's my heart.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,280
Can I kiss you?

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,680
Kiss me harder.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
What's wrong?

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Where's Otis?

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,080
I think I might have killed him.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,240
Uh...

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Turn around.

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Hey, Dad.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,280
Oh, hey! Great hat.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Good morning, Jeanie.
All right, let's get out of here, huh?

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah.

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,320
So, uh, where's your mate?

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Uh, he should be here.

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,160
- You know, on time is...
- Late.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
- Right.
- Hey!

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,040
- Hey, dude.
- Sorry, packing disaster.

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
- All right.
- Hey, Jean.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,880
- Hi, Eric.
- What are you wearing?

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
What are you wearing, bruv?

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,760
And you've got...
Why have you got a laptop charger?

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,360
- We're just going to a campsite, right?
- No, we're in a forest.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,960
We're hiking, I told you.

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,160
So,
I shouldn't have worn espadrilles then?

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,600
Eric, you're gonna go into the woods a boy
and you're gonna come out

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,760
a man of nature. Mark my words.

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,320
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, let's hit it.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,960
- You will take care of them, won't you?
- Oh, relax, Jeanie.

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,880
He is perfectly safe in my hands.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Trust me.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,800
Now, let's burn some rubber.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,600
Should we play some tunes?

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,400
Come on, DJ Remi on the decks and that.
What you saying?

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,560
How about this?

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,920
Awesome.

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,240
Have you told Maeve
you can't see her anymore yet?

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,160
Ola won't speak to me until I do.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,120
- I don't want to hurt her.
- So, who's Maeve? Hmm?

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
- No one.
- Well, I mean...

48
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,600
She's... she's a friend.

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
Uh-huh.

Do that.

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Do it to me.

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
I love a makeover.

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,080
- You want me to paint your nails, Froggy?
- No, thanks.

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,840
Look what I ordered.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,400
Ta da!

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
It's for Jonathan.

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,440
To say thank you for all the babysitting
Cynthia has yet to agree to.

61
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,120
- She's gonna love me.
- That's emotional manipulation.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I know. I'm an evil genius.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do that.

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
I've got an NA meeting today.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,176
- It's a friends-and-family session.
- That's really good.

66
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
I was hoping you could come.

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,840
I've got work to do.

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Please come.

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,360
I want you to see how well I'm doing.

70
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,840
Plus, there's free biscuits.

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
What kind?

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Custard creams.

73
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,120
Oh, hello.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,560
Hi, I'm Viv. Jackson's tutor.

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,720
- Nice house.
- Hello.

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
- Hi.
- You're studying on the weekend,

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
that's... dedicated.

78
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
- We're actually rehearsing his lines for...
- Shakespeare.

79
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,960
Uh, Viv is helping me
with my Shakespeare essay for English.

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,320
So, um, yeah.
Cool. We're gonna go study now.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
- You've met, right?
- We've literally just said hello.

82
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,480
She's nice. She's really smart.

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,400
What was that about?

84
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,280
Yeah, I haven't told them
about the play yet.

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,600
My mum wouldn't get it.

86
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,640
Anyway, talk to me about Dex.

87
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,720
- What do your friends think of him?
- I don't have time for friends,

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,920
but I can be more social
once I get in to university.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,480
You do know
a boyfriend is like a friend, right?

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Yeah, but Dex is busy too.
Our schedules are very compatible.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
- Okay, all right. Tell me about him.
- Well,

92
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,000
he's the 34th fastest Rubik's Cuber
in the world.

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
He likes BBQ flavored Doritos.

94
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,256
He bites his bottom lip when he thinks
about something really difficult.

95
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,640
And he's spoken to me exactly 26 times,
using a total of 556 words.

96
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,600
Right, okay.

97
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,800
I meant,
what does he like to do in his spare time?

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,040
Oh, he works at Pegasus Hobbies and Games
at the weekend. Why?

99
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520

The Happy Campers Guidebook,

113
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,320
we need to find a spot
near a source of water.

114
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
No. Otis, my man,
you've gotta put that book away.

115
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,640
You know, we've got all the information
we need right here.

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,880
Do you do a lot of camping
in America, Remi?

117
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,520
Oh, yeah. All the time.

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
My wife Delilah and I, we...

119
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
like to take our little boys
out of the city as much as we can.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
Oh. Shh, shh.

121
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,320
- That's a nightingale.
- Where?

122
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
Oh, yeah. Right, right there.

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
- Do you see her?
- Oh. Oh.

124
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,160
- She's so rare.
- Wow. That's, like, so pretty.

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
- Yeah.
- Uh...

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,400
I think...

127
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
it's a crow.

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,080
Well, this looks like
an all right place to camp.

129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,040
Yeah, it's got good ley lines, you know.

130
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
What?

131
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,080
Mmm.

132
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,720
Here. Get your laughing gear
around this baby.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,560
- Keep yourself warm.
- Okay, I don't think we should drink,

134
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,160
whilst we hike, Dad. It's stupid.

135
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Is he always like this?
Do try and relax, Otis.

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,720
- Try and relax, dude.
- I'm relaxed, shut up.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,720
- I'm relaxed.
- I think we should get our first hike in

138
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,360
right now.

139
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,080
Well, I mean,
we should set up the tents first.

140
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,040
No, I think it's time we try to access
our inner wild man.

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,920
- Are you with me, Eric?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Good lad.

144
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,640
I think we should get drunk with your dad.

145
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,280
Can you smell the wild garlic, Eric?

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Yes, I can, Remi. Yes, I can!

147
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Good lad!

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,840
Jakob!

149
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Jakob!

150
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, hi. Front door was open.

151
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm making you a new pan shelf.

152
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm doing a vagina...

153
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,640
I'm doing a vagina workshop
in a bit and I...

154
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,400
Think you could keep it down?

155
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Yeah, sure.

156
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll just use my silencer.

157
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,880
That's my James Bond impression.

158
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,920
I promise you, won't be long.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You ready?

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
Ready as I'll ever be.

161
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Okay.

162
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
He's looking at us.

163
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Act like I've said something really funny.

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
Okay, too much. Too much. Reign it in.

165
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,840
He's making his way over.
Remember what I said, all right? Be cool,

166
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
- be calm, be confident.
- Bev.

167
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
- Hi.
- Whoa.

168
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,720
Honestly, don't worry about it, Bev.
It's fine. It happens all the time.

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,960
You keep calling her "Bev."
Her name's actually Viv.

170
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Viv.

171
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm so sorry.

172
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
I did know that.
I'm just terrible with names.

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
- I didn't know you guys were...
- Friends. We're just friends.

174
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,040
Who have casual sex sometimes.

175
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah. Right? Well, uh...

176
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
what can I help you with, Viv?

177
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,840
<i>War of the Ring.</i>

178
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Oh, I love that game,
but we've just sold our last one.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,240
- Shit.
- Tell you what,

180
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,200
maybe I could take your number down,

181
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,160
and I can let you know
when it comes back in stock.

182
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Yeah.

183
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,120
That's me.

184
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll never forget the look on their faces.

185
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
Staring at me.

186
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,960
The man who was supposed to be
their father...

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,880
shitting into a plastic bag
in the middle of Hamleys.

188
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
That's my biggest regret.

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Well, thank you for sharing, Nathan.

190
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,720
That was... very touching.

191
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,120
I'd like to share.

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,800
- I'm Erin and I'm an addict.
- Hello.

193
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,800
I've been clean for 13 months now.

194
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,720
And, you know, every day is a struggle.

195
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
This is my daughter, Maeve, here too.

196
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,800
She's very angry with me,

197
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
but I understand her anger,

198
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,640
and I want her to know
it's okay to blame me

199
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,360
because so much of her pain is my fault.

200
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
But I also want her to know
that life hasn't been easy for me either.

201
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,520
I have ended up in many bad situations
in my life,

202
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,680
but I was just doing the best that I could
with the tools I had at the time.

203
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Maeve...

204
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,520
I will never forgive myself
for abandoning you and your brother.

205
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
And I just hope...

206
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,160
you'll be able to find it in yourself
to forgive me.

207
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
You're unbelievable.

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
- What's wrong?
- It's all about you, isn't it, Erin?

209
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,240
That wasn't an apology.
That was just another excuse.

210
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,280
You don't end up in bad situations.
You make bad choices.

211
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,520
Hey, body slammer. What you doing here?

212
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh, dear.

213
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,760
- Can you give me a hand, please?
- Why would I do that... sucker?

214
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,560
Come on. It was pretty funny.

215
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,160
You don't laugh much, do you?

216
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,200
Always so serious in the face department.
Is that your <i>schtick?</i>

217
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,360
What's this for?

218
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,120
Well, come and have a look if you like.

219
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm not interested.

220
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,880
Except you kind of are.

221
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm not.

222
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,600
Oops.

223
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,960
Yeah, it might be easier
if you just carry them inside for me.

My brother and I,
we teach this class once a week.

230
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,080
- Where did you guys learn how to dance?
- Yeah, you know, around and about.

231
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,400
Happened in the army.
Second tour of Afghanistan.

232
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,400
My tank was attacked
by a pack of wild dogs.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
- I am lucky to be alive.
- I didn't ask.

234
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,960
But you really, really want to.

235
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
I don't feel sorry for you.

236
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,920
- I need a partner.
- Perfect.

237
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,000
Jerry, meet Maeve.

238
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
No, I can't dance.

239
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
<i>♪ Simple things ♪</i>

240
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,480
Right. Hands <i>above </i>the hips now, Jerry.
It's not the 1960s anymore.

241
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,800
This week's focus
is on the pleasure points

242
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,600
inside the vagina.

243
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,840
Now, the primary pleasure point,

244
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,680
if you want to refer
to your leaflets, yes,

245
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
is the clitoris,

246
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,440
which can be found at the crest
of the labia majora.

247
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
Behold, the clitoris.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,600
Well, it doesn't actually come out,
but, um...

249
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,280
- Yes.
- Oh, yes, I was wondering...

250
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,040
if your bike has been sitting
in the garden for six years,

251
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,880
it's probably going to be quite rusty,
isn't it?

252
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,640
Is the bike in question your vagina?

253
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,240
Yes.

254
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,160
What I'm asking is,

255
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,840
if you haven't been touched
in a long time,

256
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,640
are you still going to feel anything?

257
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,040
I can assure you, vaginal pleasure
does not diminish with age

258
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920
or lack of contact.

259
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,880
In fact, there are many ways that we...

260
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
One moment, please.

261
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
You said it wasn't gonna take long!

262
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,120
Just stop!

263
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,040
Three more screws.

264
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,600
Look, I didn't ask for a fucking pan shelf
in the first place.

265
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
My pan shelf is fine.

266
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
Your pans don't fit.

267
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,560
My pans...

268
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
fit...

269
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
fine.

270
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,120
Colander.

271
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,600
Take your hand away.

272
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
This isn't about the pan shelves, is it?

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
You...

274
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
are...

275
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,520
everywhere.

276
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,880
Your things are everywhere.

277
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
And why do you have
so much loose change, huh?

278
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,200
I-I can't get two seconds alone
with my own thoughts because...

279
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,680
there you are again.

280
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,240
And there and there.

281
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
We are in a relationship.

282
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,400
I kissed Remi.

283
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
See.

284
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,360
Three more screws.

285
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,120
Oh, shit.

286
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
All right, ladies.

287
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
Could you take up
your hand mirrors, please?

288
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,760
Come and see me afterwards.
I've got something that may help...

289
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,680
you to get back on your bike.

290
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,960
Guys, do you think
maybe we should head back?

291
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,480
No, Otis. It's your go.

292
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,960
- I don't want to play.
- Okay.

293
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,800
Never have I ever had to choose
between my girlfriend

294
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
and the girl I'm secretly in love with.

295
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,200
Oh! Oh.

296
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
Oh, is this about
the mysterious Maeve, huh?

297
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,360
Oh, come on, Otis.
Open up to your old man.

298
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,360
- We're friends.
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,520
I used to like her more than that. Um...

300
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,640
She didn't feel the same way,

301
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,400
but now she told me
she has feelings for me.

302
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,280
And my girlfriend kind of found out.

303
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,400
- Uh-oh.
- So, uh...

304
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,440
now I have to choose between...

305
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,360
cutting Maeve out my life
or losing my girlfriend.

306
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,680
Yeah, I was in a similar situation once.

307
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,080
It's a difficult decision,

308
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,160
but the heart...

309
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,160
wants what it wants.

310
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,240
Is that what happened with Mum?

311
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,880
Yeah, and sometimes you...

312
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
you're just with the wrong person, Otis.

313
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,680
Uh...

314
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,360
- Yeah, um...
- Everything all right, Dad?

315
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,360
Yeah, just, uh, you know,
just getting my...

316
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
my bearings.

317
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
This is faulty. Have you got a map?

318
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Mm-hmm.

319
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,040
Um, do you want to use my phone?

320
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,800
No, a map is just fine.

321
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Yeah. Uh...

322
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,000
This way.

323
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,120
Yeah, it is definitely this way.

324
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,840
Maybe the drinking was a bad idea.

325
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
Have you ever had a weird dream?

326
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Oi!

327
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,000
- I'm talking to you.
- I don't dream.

328
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,320
- Everyone dreams.
- No, I've smoked too much weed.

329
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
What about a sex dream?

330
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,000
- About another guy?
- Look, I said I don't dream. Okay?

331
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,040
I had a sex dream last night about a girl.

332
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,960
Even though we didn't actually have sex,
we just kissed.

333
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,960
- I just can't stop thinking about it.
- Dreams aren't real.

334
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,720
That's why they're called dreams.

335
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
Do you think it means something
if I'm having sex dreams about girls?

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,280
I don't know.

337
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,080
Go and ask Google like everyone else.

338
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,040
You didn't answer my question before.

339
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,040
Where'd you learn to dance?

340
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,640
Well, we lived with this lady for a bit,

341
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,240
ex-ballroom champion. She was horrible,

342
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,400
but she had rhythm, so...

343
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,840
What do you mean "for a bit"?

344
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,080
Foster families never keep
the disabled kid around too long.

345
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Make a sad face and I will ram you.

346
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,320
I keep seeing your mum coming in
and out of NA.

347
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
She looks like a character.

348
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah, well, that's none of your business.

349
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Cynthia said that she pissed off
a few years ago.

350
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
- Junkies are the worst.
- She's been clean for two years.

351
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah, we've all heard that one before.

352
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
You don't know me...

353
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,760
or my mum, okay?

354
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
Oh, I thought we we're going to bond.
Orphan to orphan.

355
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,200
Well, you were wrong.

356
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,320
Hey, I didn't mean to cross a line.
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,360
Maybe your mum's different. I mean...

358
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,280
Nothing changes,
if nothing changes, right?

359
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,480
Did you just make that up?

360
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,280
No. That's the quote
they use on their poster.

361
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,000
I think it should say, "Once an addict...

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,160
always an addict."

363
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,480
You're a real dick, you know?

364
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,240
Who do you notice more when you walk
down the street? Men or women?

365
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Both.

366
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,240
- I thought everyone did.
- Well, I only notice girls.

367
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
They're everywhere.

368
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Um...

369
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm a pansexual, apparently.

370
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
What, like...

371
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,320
fucking pots and pans?

372
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,200
I knew a guy who...

373
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,960
used to like to stick his dick
in the suction pipe of a vacuum cleaner.

374
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
It's normal.

375
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,040
Pansexual means that you're attracted
to the person, not the sex or gender.

376
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,360
Uh, it's about the connection you have
with the human being,

377
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,080
not with their genitalia.

378
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Huh.

379
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
Kind of makes sense, actually.

380
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,320
It doesn't make sense to me.

381
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,576
You were supposed to be here
three hours ago.

382
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,040
Yeah, I walked.

383
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm really enjoying walking at the moment.
It's so evaporating.

384
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,000
- Invigorating?
- Yeah. That's what I said.

385
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Oh, sorry. That was an accident.

386
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Okay.

387
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Ah...

388
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
Do you not want me to?

389
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,320
What makes you think I don't?

390
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,240
- You keep slapping me in the head.
- Maybe we can watch a film or something?

391
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Yeah.

392
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you sure everything's okay?

393
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,800
I feel like you've been acting
a bit strange

394
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,360
since what happened with the bus.

395
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,800
- Do you want to talk about it?
- I'm fine, Steve.

396
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm just tired from my walk.
Go and get the laptop.

397
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Ah...

398
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,040
...there's something to be jealous of.

399
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,960
- So, when he texts you...
- He won't text me.

400
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
He will definitely text you.

401
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,240
And you will definitely make him wait

402
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,600
at least two and a half hours
for a response.

403
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,560
- Why so much game playing?
- Only at the start.

404
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,680
Eventually, you will just like each other
for your personalities.

405
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,080
When have you ever liked anyone
for their personality?

406
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I did.

407
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,080
I liked someone quite a lot.

408
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Yeah, I'm sure that you're pining over
Maeve Wiley's love of feminist literature.

409
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,136
It had nothing to do with
the size of her boobs.

410
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,360
Why are you so chippy?

411
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,120
Because guys like you
never see girls like me.

412
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,960
All your conquests look like
they've been made in lab.

413
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,120
It's transparent.

414
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
I really liked Maeve, you know.

415
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,280
What was it about her
that you liked so much?

416
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,560
It's just the feeling, isn't it?

417
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,680
I can't really explain it.

418
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,160
"Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind,

419
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,920
and therefore,
is winged Cupid painted blind."

420
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,880
- <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>
- Yeah, you know.

421
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,840
So, I've been reading his other plays.

422
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,760
Not sure about all the pixie stuff,
but he's all right.

423
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,600
I think you should tell your mum
that you're in a school play.

424
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
She'll be really proud.

425
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,560
Sorry, did you just give me
a compliment just then? Or...

426
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,680
If you stop being so lazy
and learn your lines.

427
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

428
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you for today.

429
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,200
It's all right.

430
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Bye.

431
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Hey, Viv?

432
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Yeah?

433
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,440
I <i>do </i>see you, by the way.

434
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,560
I see a girl that gave Dex her number.

435
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,160
See you later.

436
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,400
Two and a half hours.

437
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Okay.

438
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,000
Dad, we're lost, all right?

439
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,520
We are not lost.

440
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,320
What does the flipping map say?

441
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,280
It says it's a cheap piece of shit.

442
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
It is okay to admit we're lost.

443
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm not going to admit anything
because we are not lost.

444
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Guys!

445
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Guys!

446
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,960
- Guys, I think I can see our stuff.
- Ah, you see!

447
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,800
I told you we were not lost.

448
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,160
Oh, my God!

449
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,560
My hat!

450
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,800
All right, let's just get these tents up.

451
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,360
They are pop-up, right?

452
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,280
Yeah, you just gotta open the bag,
and then, you just...

453
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,840
And then it just pops up.

454
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,280
You need to take the... strap.

455
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Dad?

456
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,040
All right, you think you're winning?

457
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,040
Do you? I have been through
so much worse than you.

458
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,680
How many bloody doctorates
have you got? You...

459
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,360
piece of fucking shit!

460
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,880
Pop-up, my arse!

461
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
Why don't we get a hotel?

462
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,920
No, we're not getting a fucking hotel.

463
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,440
Hey, two rooms, please...

464
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Janine.

465
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,120
What are they for?

466
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,200
Just felt like buying them.

467
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,760
They're far too expensive.

468
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,480
I want a divorce.

469
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
You were right.

470
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
I did make choices.

471
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
And I can't take them back.

472
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,760
And nothing you can say
will ever make me feel

473
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
any worse than I already do.

474
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Can you do my nails for me, please?

475
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
I haven't got all night, though, so...

476
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,240
- Why'd you keep ignoring Rahim?
- 'Cause I'm hanging with you.

477
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,496
I don't want to be one of these people
that're suddenly obsessed

478
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,520
- with who they're dating.
- Well, that's very sweet, Eric,

479
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,000
but why are you ignoring him?
Didn't he ask you to be his boyfriend?

480
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,800
Okay.

481
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,280
I have to tell you something.

482
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,120
Okay? But you can't be mad
I didn't say anything before.

483
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,320
Do you remember
I got detention last term with Adam?

484
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Well...

485
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,120
he gave me a blowjob.

486
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,440
And since he's been back, we've been
going on all these late-night walks

487
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,360
where we go and smash stuff
and then we kiss...

488
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,120
a lot and... and it's amazing.

489
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,680
Why is your face not moving?

490
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,640
Because he... he bullied you...

491
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,480
- for years, Eric. He's a horrible person.
- No, but people can change.

492
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,480
If he's changed, then why is he making you
sneak around at night?

493
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,880
Well, it's romantic.

494
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,040
Something you wouldn't know about
because you're too busy

495
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,960
pretending to have feelings
for your girlfriend,

496
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,400
when everyone knows
that you're actually in love with Maeve.

497
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,480
- No, take that back.
- You take back what you said.

498
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,496
- What about Rahim?
- Oh, my God.

499
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,360
He's not ashamed to be with you.

500
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,400
- Don't pretend to be all "Team Rahim" now.
- What's that supposed to mean?

501
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
I think that that is what this
is really about.

502
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,880
You don't like being
the one left behind for a change.

503
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,560
No, Eric. This is about you
being so self-hating

504
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,360
that you'd let yourself fall for someone
who literally treats you like shit.

505
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,840
Don't therapize me, Otis.

506
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,480
You don't know what my reality is.

507
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Okay.

508
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Do what you want.

509
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay? But...

510
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,080
ask yourself...
why have you really been hiding it?

511
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,880
Why, Delilah? Don't! Don't hang up!

512
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,680
Argh!

513
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,440
- I've gotta go check on my dad.
- Yeah, we'll talk later.

514
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Fuck.

515
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Yeah?

516
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,400
You all right, Dad?

517
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Yeah, Delilah has, uh...

518
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
has left me...

519
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
for someone else.

520
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Oh, shit.

521
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,560
Are you upset by that?

523
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah.

524
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Yeah, um...

525
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,600
I'm upset for you.

526
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,440
'Cause it's...

527
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
it's okay...

528
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,680
if you want to cry, Otis.

529
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I mean...

530
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,200
- Yeah, I will. I'm good.
- Yeah, you know, it's...

531
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,640
it's all right...

532
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
for men to cry.

533
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,520
- I know.
- Yeah.

534
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
Oh, God.

535
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
It's...

536
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
What's wrong?

537
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,240
I'm going to kiss you.

538
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,400
Why are we at school?

539
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,560
We're always at school.

540
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Where's Otis?

541
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,760
Don't worry... he's with Maeve.

542
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
You're safe.

543
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
Jean speaking.

544
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,360
<i>Hi, Jean. It's Delilah. Is Remi there?</i>

545
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,160
Remi's with Otis, Delilah.

546
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Can I help?

547
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,720
<i>Um, yeah,
can you get him to give me a call?</i>

548
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,400
<i>We need to arrange a time for him
to come and get his things.</i>

549
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,080
<i>You were right after all, Jean.</i>

550
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,760
<i>I couldn't change him either.</i>

551
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Yes.

552
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,800
I'll give him the message.

553
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,720
Don't go. Don't go.

554
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Go.

555
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Morning.

556
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,600
Delilah didn't leave you
for someone else, did she?

557
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,480
You cheated again.

558
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,080
And you came here
'cause you had nowhere else to go.

559
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,840
Quick! Quick! Come here, Otis, Remi!

560
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Come, man!

561
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,560
Good thing for insurance, eh?

562
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,880
You did get insurance, didn't you?

563
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,760
I don't think he got insurance.

- Oh.

580
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,760
But if you think he's changed,
I believe you.

581
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,640
I didn't mean what I said about Ola.

582
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,880
Okay, if you're happy, then I'm happy.

583
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,600
I really thought he came back
to see me this time.

584
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360

588
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,960
God. Please never leave us again, Jean.

589
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,800
Oh.

590
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,320
- How was it?
- Great.

591
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,840
Great. We saw a nightingale.

592
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Oh.

593
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,160
And it rained, and we got lost.

594
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,160
Dad fought a tent like it was a person.

595
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
And the nightingale was a crow.

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah.

Delilah called.

634
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,360
You know I'm a sex addict, Jean.

635
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,600
I'm going to get help this time.

636
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,200
I want to be a good father.

637
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,320

00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,840

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,880
Um...

641
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,680
I might take your hand, actually.

642
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,840
No, wait. No. That feels weird. Sorry.

643
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay. Here goes.

644
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
I love you.

645
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,600
Uh... I said... I love you.
Why are you laughing?

646
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Because...

647
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,520
...you don't love me.

648
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,560
And I've just realized
that I definitely don't love you.

649
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,360
I think we got it wrong.

650
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,800
I think we're supposed to be friends.

651
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
What?

652
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,160
We're so different, you know.

653
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,800
I like to be in the moment
and you're so...

654
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,800
uptight.

655
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,600
You said you had to think about it,
and it was difficult.

656
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,960
It shouldn't be difficult, Otis. We're 16.

657
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,600
Are you breaking up with me?

658
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah.

659
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
I am.

660
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,160
Ah, ah...

661
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,880
Okay, um, actually, just...

662
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,880
please go.

663
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Okay.

664
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,880
I'm really sorry, Otis.

665
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Fuck.

666
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,600
Rahim.

667
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,320
So, have you decided
not to ignore me anymore?

668
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Sorry.

669
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,640
I had some stuff
that I needed to think about.

670
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,960
This is all new for me.

671
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
Uh...

672
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,000
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

673
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
I asked you first.

674
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,640
Yes.

675
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,640

676
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,040

677
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,600
