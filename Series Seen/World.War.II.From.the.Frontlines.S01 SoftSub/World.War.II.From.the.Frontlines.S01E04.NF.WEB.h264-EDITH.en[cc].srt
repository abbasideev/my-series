00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,083
[man] <i>I never will forget it.</i>

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,958
<i>The squadron commander
walked up to me and he said,</i>

4
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>"Go get some sleep
because you're flying tomorrow."</i>

5
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,916
<i>We get to the briefing...</i>

6
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,708
<i>...and they pull back the curtains.</i>

7
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,875
<i>We were to dive through the clouds</i>

8
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,041
<i>in broad daylight, at high noon,</i>

9
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,458
<i>to bring Germany to its knees.</i>

10
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>He said, "I have to tell you, fellows,</i>

11
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,791
<i>that if we only get
one airplane over that target,</i>

12
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,416
<i>it'll be a successful mission."</i>

13
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,458
<i>And I was petrified because you knew...</i>

14
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:48,166
<i>...you were facing the stark possibility</i>

15
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,416
<i>that that would be your last mission.</i>

16
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,000
[Winston Churchill]
<i>We demand unconditional surrender.</i>

17
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,416
[narrator]
As World War II enters its fourth year,

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,291
the outcome of the conflict
still hangs in the balance.

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,791
Hitler has suffered
his first major defeat, on Russia's soil.

20
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,916
So both sides are scaling up production,
and the leaders are raising the stakes.

21
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,500
{\an8}[Franklin Roosevelt]
Hitler and Mussolini, they will understand

22
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,458
{\an8}the enormity of their miscalculation.

23
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,875
[narrator] But to win the war,
the Allies must reconquer Europe

24
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,333
and ultimately invade Germany.

25
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:34,958
[Churchill] <i>Their willpower to resist
must be completely broken.</i>

26
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,666
[narrator] There's just one problem:

27
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,000
Nazi-occupied Europe has
some of the best defenses in the world.

28
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,875
[soldier] Fire!

29
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,916
[Joseph Goebbels] <i>Do you want a total war?</i>

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,291
Do you want it even more total and radical
than we are capable of imagining it today?

31
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:00,791
[narrator] It's so impregnable,
they call it "Fortress Europe."

32
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,583
But, as the British say,
Fortress Europe has no roof.

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,291
So, now the Allies
will rain destruction from the skies

34
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,125
to smash Hitler's war machine.

35
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:26,083
<i>[Roosevelt] We believe that the Nazis
and the fascists have asked for it,</i>

36
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,125
{\an8}and they're going to get it.

37
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,416
[narrator] Tennessee airman
John Luckadoo and his crew

38
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,541
are about to fly
into the heart of Nazi Germany.

39
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,583
They're part of a bombing campaign

40
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:08,583
designed to destroy German military sites
and weapons production.

41
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,833
[John] <i>We knew that it was
heavily defended with anti-aircraft.</i>

42
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:24,333
<i>It was a pretty dismal prospect
that we would be able to succeed.</i>

43
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,708
[narrator] For the Allied bomber crews,
a host of dangers lie ahead.

44
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,875
Thousands of German anti-aircraft guns.

45
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,291
And hundreds of Luftwaffe fighters.

46
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,125
[John] <i>We started across the channel.</i>

47
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,833
[wind whistling]

48
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,833
<i>It was 50 to 60 degrees below zero.</i>

49
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,833
<i>You could freeze to death in a second.</i>

50
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:58,500
<i>But I'll tell you what,
it's no worse that's coming right for us.</i>

51
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,958
[loud explosions]

52
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,625
[pilot] Oh! Oh, my God!

53
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,916
Whoa!

54
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,958
[narrator] German guns
fill the sky with flak,

55
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,708
exploding chunks of red-hot metal.

56
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,875
[John] <i>You hear the shrapnel,
as the shells explode,</i>

57
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,541
<i>ricocheting through the airplane.</i>

58
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,500
[flak clattering, pinging]

59
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,791
<i>And suddenly we're in a real deadly game.</i>

60
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,666
<i>Out of the corner of my eye,
you could see the German fighters</i>

61
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,125
<i>flying right for us.</i>

62
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,541

{\an8}<i>They went right through us,
350 miles an hour.</i>

69
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,041
[crew] Fighters, ten o'clock.

70
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,166
-Incoming.
-I don't see him.

71
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,625
There's two at two o'clock.

[jet buzzing past]

73
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,750

00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,916
{\an8}[John] <i>It's not surprising that some guys
crack under that kind of a strain.</i>

77
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:24,916
<i>The fear and the trauma
of combat could turn your hair white.</i>

78
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,416

80
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,958

[pilot] Bombs away.

[bombardier] Bombs away on primary.

85
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,250
[John] <i>You go out, fight your way
all the way to the target.</i>

86
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,208
<i>Then you began to try

87
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,500
<i>You had to be pretty much immune</i>

88

<i>to the fact that if you survived,
you were just damn lucky.</i>

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,125
<i>But when you get out of that airplane
and you kiss the ground</i>

90
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,291
<i>and say, "Thank God I'm back,
I survived that one,"</i>

91
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,375
<i>and then get up and do it again tomorrow?</i>

92
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,708
<i>That takes a lot of guts.</i>

93
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,291
<i>It takes a lot of soul searching.</i>

94
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,708
<i>But we knew that we had a job
to do for freedom and liberation.</i>

95
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,708
[narrator] By the summer of 1943,

96
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:21,000
70,000 tons of explosives
have been dropped onto Germany.

97
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,916
But the bomber crews
are failing to destroy key targets

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,083
and gain a foothold into Fortress Europe.

99
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,291
The British solution...

100
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,750
pick easier targets.

101
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,958
May 1943.

102
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,416
There's momentous news from Africa.

00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,541
<i>and one of the heaviest,

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,083
<i>And soon, hundreds of white flags
were appearing all over the place.</i>

[troops cheering]

113
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,125
{\an8}[narrator] The Allies now control
the entire North African coast,

{\an8}raising the tantalizing new possibility:
break into Europe from the south.

115
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:48,250
Mussolini's fascist Italy
is just across the Mediterranean.

[man in German] <i>The Führer and the Duce

Among the invasion force is Maurice White,

[Maurice] <i>There were ships

<i>We were sitting there,
out in the Mediterranean.</i>

<i>The calm before the storm.</i>

127
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:57,291
<i>Yeah, you're naturally afraid because
you don't know what to expect, really.</i>

<i>The door goes down and away you go.</i>

129
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:18,375

130
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,541
<i>We weren't fired on when we landed.</i>

131
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,250

[guns firing]

133
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,875

the Italians right out of the war,</i>

168

169
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,666
{\an8}[Maurice] <i>I was amazed
at the number of Italians who gave up.</i>

170
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,291
{\an8}<i>They didn't want to fight at all.</i>

171
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,458
<i>They were fed up
with Mussolini and the Germans.</i>

172
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,083
<i>There were quite a few white flags
sticking on the end of their rifles,</i>

173
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:07,041
<i>and they just gave their rifles up
and had their hands up too, so...</i>

174
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,875
[narrator] The Allies have
successfully landed in Fortress Europe.

175
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,041
But the fight is far from over.

176
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,958
The Germans and Soviets
are fighting a huge tank battle

177
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,166
near the city of Kursk.

[narrator]
And in Asia, the war hangs in the balance.

181
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,291
[man in Japanese]
<i>The United States and Britain</i>

182
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,208
<i>will keep resisting Greater East Asia.</i>

183
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:09,750
<i>We must come together and liberate
ourselves from their shackles!</i>

184
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,166
[narrator] Japan's aim is to dominate
the whole of East Asia,

185
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,291
{\an8}and to pull that off, they have
created a fortress of their own.

{\an8}Theirs is in the ocean,

187

[Roosevelt] <i>We are pushing forward</i>

<i>We shall not settle
for less than total victory.</i>

191
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,791
[narrator] To win the war,

192
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,250
the Americans will need
to conquer these islands one by one.

193
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,916
The tiny atoll
of Tarawa is their next target.

194
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,916
The U.S. Marines are heading for Tarawa.

195
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:07,375
Among them is 17-year-old
Joe Varucene from California.

196

{\an8}[Joe] <i>I was just as scared as anybody.</i>

something and I felt good about it.</i>

[ship horn blowing]

199
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,583

[engines buzzing]

201
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:47,500
<i>All of a sudden, there was planes
coming over and they bombed.</i>

202
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,833
<i>It was just magnificent.</i>

203
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,333
<i>I was thrilled.</i>

204
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,916
<i>So, I told one of the guys, I says,
"That's the island I want to go to."</i>

205
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,500
<i>I says, "There's going
to be nothing living there."</i>

206
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,750
[narrator] What Joe doesn't know
is that 5,000 Japanese soldiers

207
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,625
have survived the bombardment.

208
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,250
[Joe] <i>In my mind,
I was thinking like in the movies.</i>

209

[bullets pinging]

211
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,458
<i>But all the water
was just skipping with bullets.</i>

212
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:57,083
<i>The first guy out of our boat
got hit with a blast in the neck.</i>

214
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,916

<i>Come hell or high water, I was going in.</i>

219
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,333
<i>I would go underwater
and hold my breath as long as I could.</i>

220
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:38,250
<i>But when I got to the beach, there was
a whole bunch of Japs waiting for us.</i>

221
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,583
<i>All hell broke loose.</i>

222
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,250
[heavy gunfire]

223
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,791
<i>It was crazy.</i>

224
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,791
[indistinct shouting]

225
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,250
<i>They told us,
"Anything beyond this line, you shoot."</i>

226
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,333
<i>"We don't care what it is: shoot."</i>

227
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,791
[soldier] Fire!

228
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,000
<i>But then our lieutenant got killed.</i>

229
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,875
<i>They stuck a rifle right in his neck.</i>

230
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,875
<i>He was completely decapitated.</i>

231
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,166
<i>Things were desperate.</i>

232
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,083
[soldier] Forward!

233
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,333
<i>I kept shooting until the rifle was empty.</i>

00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,250
[gunfire fades]

235
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,666
<i>Two guys jumped up and grabbed me
and pulled me up over the wall.</i>

236
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,625
<i>That was the end of that for me.</i>

237
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,500
[narrator] More than a thousand
of Joe's comrades lose their lives.

238
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,458
The Japanese fight to the death.

239
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,708
Almost 5,000 are killed.

240
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:42,416
Only 17 Japanese soldiers
survive and surrender.

241
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,166
[Joe] <i>They were people.</i>

242

like we have mothers and fathers.</i>

00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,875
<i>We fight for our country, right or wrong.</i>

244
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,291
<i>They fought
for their country, right or wrong.</i>

245
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,916
<i>As far as I'm concerned, they were brave.</i>

246
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,791
[narrator] The Americans
have taken an important step

247
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,666
towards rolling back the Japanese in Asia.

248
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,916
But ahead of them is an entire ocean...

249
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,541
{\an8}and dozens of islands
that need to be conquered

250
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,916
{\an8}before they can even
come close to the goal of Japan itself.

251
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,500
Meanwhile, in Europe...

252
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,791
the bombing campaign
against German military targets continues.

253
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,500
But the Nazi war machine
keeps churning out tanks and guns.

254
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:07,458
[Goebbels]
<i>Millions of hands must get to work</i>

255
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:11,458
<i>and supply the front
with all the weapons it needs.</i>

256
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:15,000
[narrator] So, Churchill
has made a ruthless decision...

257
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:22,125
...to wage a bombing campaign
against German civilians...

258
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,541
[crowd chanting]

259
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,541
...crush their morale
and undermine support for Hitler's war.

260
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:33,083
[Churchill] <i>When we read every week
of the frightful cruelties</i>

261
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,208
<i>with which the German armies torment us,</i>

262
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:41,333
<i>we may feel sure
that we bear the sword of justice.</i>

263
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,416
[narrator]
Seven hundred and 87 heavy bombers

264
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,875
are heading to Germany.

265
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,541
The mission: obliterate Hamburg.

266
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:09,125
Fourteen-year-old Günter Lucks
is home alone with his brother.

267
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,833
[Günter in German] <i>I found a flyer.</i>

268
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:21,583
<i>"Leave the city of Hamburg
to avoid unnecessary losses."</i>

269
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:25,000
<i>It was signed RAF, the Royal Air Force.</i>

270
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,708
<i>I was scared and I told my brother.</i>

271
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,333
<i>He said, "That's just propaganda."</i>

272
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:44,083
<i>So, I threw it in the trash.</i>

273
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,125
[narrator] Reassured, Günter goes to bed.

274
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:07,250
But under the cover of darkness,
the bombers are coming.

275
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:38,333
One thousand tons of incendiaries,
designed to spread fires,

276
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,833
are dropped onto the sleeping city.

277
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,833
Günter is woken by his brother.

278
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,875
{\an8}[Günter] <i>I looked out the window
and saw a sea of flames.</i>

279
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:39,041
<i>Wherever you looked, just flames.</i>

280
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:44,583
<i>The house next door collapsed.</i>

281
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,958
<i>My brother said, "I have to go
and see what's happened to Aunt Olga."</i>

282
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:08,000
<i>I didn't want to stay there alone.</i>

283
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,000
But he went out and did not come back.

284
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30,875
<i>I thought, "I have to get out."</i>

285
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>I opened the door...</i>

286
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,166
<i>...and I saw people burning alive.</i>

287
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,375
[narrator] Forty-five thousand
German civilians are killed.

288
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,791
Günter's brother is one of them.

289
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,625
Hamburg lies in ruins.

290
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,416
Back in England, bomber pilot Don Wickens

291
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,208
receives fresh orders.

292
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,291
{\an8}[Don] <i>We were briefed to go to Hamburg.</i>

293
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,875
{\an8}<i>We said to the intelligence officer,</i>

294
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,000
{\an8}<i>"What on earth
are we going to Hamburg for?"</i>

295
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,375
<i>It had been bombed.</i>

296
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:38,125
<i>The whole city was just a ball of fire.</i>

297
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:44,625
<i>He said, "Well, the only building
left standing is the main post office."</i>

298
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,750
<i>"And they've built emergency shelters,
and there are 60,000 civilians."</i>

299
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,000
"That's your target."

300
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,458
Now, what do you think?

301
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,166
You're thinking just what we thought.

302
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,083
We just closed our eyes and said, "Oh."

303
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,333
And they're the bad guys.

304
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:11,208
And here we were the good guys
and we've got to do this?

305
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,791
We had no choice.

306
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,958
We went and did it.

307
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,041
<i>You never saw a sicker bunch
of young fellas</i>

308
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,041
<i>when that chore was given to us.</i>

309
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,875
[bombs whistling]

310
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,500
And it's not a heroic thing,
and it's a terrible thing.

311
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,083
And we're part of it,
whether we like it or not.

312
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:20,041
[narrator] The Allies hoped
that bombing cities

313
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,375
would cause the Germans
to turn against the war.

314
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,916
But for some it has the opposite effect.

315
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:38,166
[Günter] <i>Now, I just thought,
"Germany is in danger."</i>

316
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,250
<i>"I want to do my job
to prevent its downfall."</i>

317
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,833
<i>And then I signed up.</i>

318
00:34:56,375 --> 00:35:02,833
<i>My mother said, "It doesn't make
any sense, leave it alone and stay."</i>

319
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,500
<i>But I hated the Americans and the British.</i>

320
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,208
[narrator] The fight for Europe is on.

321
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,458
The Allies have secured Sicily.

322
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:26,041
Their next goal is Rome.

323
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,666
[newscaster] <i>It was certainly one
of the heaviest daylight raids of the war.</i>

324
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,875
<i>A terrible demonstration
of power and determination.</i>

325
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,333
[narrator]
Mussolini had promised his people

326
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:41,125
enemy bombs would never fall on Rome.

327
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:44,541
[newscaster] <i>The bombing
of great cities is a terrible thing.</i>

328
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,083
<i>We don't know what it will do
to the Italian people.</i>

329
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,750
<i>But it would certainly
weaken their will to continue the war.</i>

330
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,458
[narrator] The Italians have had enough.

331
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,916
[Roosevelt] <i>The criminal,
corrupt, fascist regime in Italy</i>

332
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,958
<i>is going to pieces.</i>

333
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,458
[narrator] Mussolini is overthrown.

334
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,083
Hitler orders a rescue operation
to bring him to safety.

335
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:13,458
[newscaster] <i>The Italian dictator
made his final escape in a cable car</i>

336
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:14,833
<i>across the Apennine Valley.</i>

337
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:18,833
<i>From there, a waiting airplane
transported him back to a worried Hitler.</i>

338
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:27,375
[narrator] Now, the Italians switch sides
and join forces with the Allies.

339
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:34,708
[newscaster] <i>Two hours ago,
Italy declared war on Germany.</i>

340
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,208
<i>The proclamation says
there can be no peace</i>

341
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,208
<i>while a single German
remains on Italian soil.</i>

342
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,708
[narrator]
But the battle for Italy is far from over.

343
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,833
The Nazi's defensive line
runs south of the capital,

344
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:55,333
through the key town of Cassino.

345
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,250
Capturing Cassino
could unlock the road to Rome.

346
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:29,333
The Germans take up
positions on the high ground.

347
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:38,916
{\an8}[Heinz in German]
<i>We got the order to go to Cassino.</i>

348
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:47,125
<i>I was with my group of snipers.</i>

349
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,541
<i>But we thought it was no longer a battle.</i>

350
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,416
[incoming bomb whistling]

351
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,583
-[indistinct chatter]
-[bombs exploding]

352
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:15,375
[Heinz] <i>Every few meters,
the Allies dropped a bomb.</i>

353
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,541
<i>We had many losses.</i>

354
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,541
<i>The dead were piled up on the hillside.</i>

355
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:39,958
<i>But we carried out our duty and our work.</i>

356
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,416
[gun fires]

357
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:48,291
{\an8}[Jim] <i>The more bombing and shelling,
the stronger they made their defense.</i>

358
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:53,916
<i>They were actually
using rubble as a fortress.</i>

359
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,166
[machine guns firing]

360
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:03,250
<i>Every morning a German gun
used to sweep the whole of the area.</i>

361
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,125
<i>They were only 50 meters away.</i>

362
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,500
<i>When it was very, very quiet,
we could speak to them, shout to them.</i>

363
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,958
<i>And we'd shout obscenities
across to each other.</i>

364
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,833
<i>But after that,
the shelling would start again.</i>

365
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,125
[soldier] Fire!

366
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,833
[narrator] For weeks, the Allies
are pinned down on the hillside.

367
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,541
[bomb explodes]

368
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,833
{\an8}[Bentley] <i>We couldn't move at all.</i>

369
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:53,916
<i>But we knew that the Germans occupied
the abbey on top of Monte Cassino.</i>

370
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,375
<i>There were German artillerists up there
who were controlling our movement.</i>

371
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,291
[narrator] The Allies
are desperate to bomb the site,

372
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:10,916
but even in war there are rules
against destroying cultural monuments.

373
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,833
[Bentley] <i>We had instructions
from President Roosevelt</i>

374
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:18,416
<i>that we could not bomb Monte Cassino</i>

375
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,916
<i>because it was so important
a religious structure.</i>

376
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:28,666
<i>However, because of the fact
it was so critical to our position,</i>

377
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:33,708
<i>we finally got word
from the president to bomb.</i>

378
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:41,250
<i>I was assigned
the task to plan this attack.</i>

379
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,083
<i>The day of the bombing,
I remember it so distinctly.</i>

380
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:01,791
<i>Beautiful blue sky
and the weather was warm.</i>

381
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,875
<i>We were going to take out
these German positions</i>

382
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,708
<i>with our heavy bombers.</i>

383
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:17,666
And I felt so great
that I had helped plan this attack.

384
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,916
[planes buzzing overhead]

385
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,625
[bombs whistling]

386
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,000
[narrator] The abbey is turned to dust.

387
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,708
But the Allies have been misled
by their intelligence reports.

388
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:27,125
{\an8}[Heinz]
<i>They thought that Germans were there.</i>

389
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,208
{\an8}<i>But there weren't any Germans up there.</i>

390
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:40,500
<i>We had been forbidden
from going into the abbey.</i>

391
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:53,375
<i>There were so many civilians inside
hiding in the basement.</i>

392
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,541
<i>They achieved nothing.</i>

393
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,791
<i>Nothing.</i>

394
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:18,375
{\an8}[Antonio in Italian]
<i>You could hear screams: "Mum! Dad!"</i>

395
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,375
<i>They were all looking
for their loved ones.</i>

396
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,458
[shouting, wailing]

397
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,166
<i>Those screams...</i>

398
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,000
<i>they can't be forgotten.</i>

399
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:50,708
[narrator] It will take another
four months of brutal fighting

400
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:54,083
before the Allies reach
the Italian capital.

401
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,166
[newscaster] <i>...from the Italian front</i>

402
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,916
<i>that the light armor
and motorized infantry</i>

403

<i>roared into Rome,
into the heart of the city.</i>

404
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:11,250
[narrator]
Fortress Europe has been prised open.

405
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:17,333
Meanwhile, in England,
the Allies are planning a secret operation

406
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:19,333
that will change the course of the war.

407
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:23,291
[newscaster] <i>A tremendous mass</i>

<i>has been pooled
by the Allied attacking forces.</i>

410
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,375
<i>This is the largest-scale
military invasion operation in history.</i>

411
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:40,958
[narrator] The attack will
forever be known as "D-Day."

412
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,250
[gulls screeching]

413
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,916
{\an8}[Dan]
<i>We knew it was going to be a big deal.</i>

414
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,916
{\an8}<i>And we knew the purpose of it.</i>

<i>The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving
people everywhere march with you.</i>

418
