172
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,500

{\an8}<i>My lieutenant gave me
the order to shoot him.</i>

177
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,708

<i>Then I said, "Turn around."</i>

180
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:59,708
At that time he probably assumed
that his time had come.

181

<i>I lowered my rifle and said...</i>

182

"Don't be afraid.
I'm not a killer, I am a human being."

183
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,416
He took a step towards me
and held out his hand

184
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,875
and said, "Thank you."

<i>"Peace be with you!"</i>

186
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,000

[narrator]
Heinz Drossel is a rare exception.

188

As well as prisoners, the German army

189
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,500
is now engaged
in the mass execution of civilians.

190
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,583
Over a million Jewish people

00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,541
[narrator]
Stalin has not been seen in months

202
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,875
and the whole war
seems to hang in the balance.

203

[in Russian] Comrades!

We have a determined enemy against us.

208
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:20,125
These people have the impudence

209
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,833
to call for the destruction
of our great Russian nation.

210
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,833
So, from now on, our task

211
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:38,708
will be to exterminate
all the Germans, to the last one.

212

If these Germans really want
a war of annihilation, they can have it.

Now, the Red Army fightback begins.

215
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,208
And the war is intensified further.

[missiles whistling]

217
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:41,333
Meanwhile, on the other side of the world,
Japan's forces are on the attack.

218
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,375
They've annexed Korea.

219

They're in China.

220
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:54,166
And they want Hong Kong,
Malaya and the Philippines...

221
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,500
as they seek
to dominate the whole of Asia.

222
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,458
They know there's one thing
that could stop them.

223
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,041
The U.S. Navy.

224
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,916
But they have a plan for that too.

{\an8}[Takeshi in Japanese]
<i>Training started on September 18.</i>

whether to join the war.

Now their leaders decide
they're not going to wait to find out.

234
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,208
Instead, they'll launch a surprise attack

235

to destroy
the American fleet at Pearl Harbor.

"Don't you get wise with me, Ward.
I asked you a question."

00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,125
So, I began to describe
what I was looking at.
