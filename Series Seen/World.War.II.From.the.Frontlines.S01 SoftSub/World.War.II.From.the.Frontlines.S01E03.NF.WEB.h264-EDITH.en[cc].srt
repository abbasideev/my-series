<i>with a glorious victory!</i>

331
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,541
[crowd cheering]

332
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:22,875
[Schönbeck] <i>At first we thought,
we're going to get out of this.</i>

333
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:34,375
<i>But then things got really bad.</i>

334
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,291
<i>We ran out of gas.</i>

335
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,083
<i>Then we ran out of ammunition.</i>

336
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,875
<i>Then we ran out of food,</i>

337
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,750
<i>so we ate the horses.</i>

338
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,291
<i>We got orders
to demolish houses for firewood.</i>

339
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:53,583
<i>We'd say, "Get out, we need your house!"</i>

340
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,333
<i>In one house,</i>

341
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,583
there was an old couple.

342
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:26,416
An old man from Stalingrad

343
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,791
with his wife.

344
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:33,000
They had made some soup.

345
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,250
Something warm.

346
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,000
He said, "Come, eat with us."

347
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,541
I couldn't believe it!

348
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,916

[Schönbeck] <i>We had
a little pine tree in my bunker.</i>

352
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,708
<i>I tried to put on a brave face for my men.</i>

353
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:39,250
<i>I said, "Guys,
we'll get out of here somehow."</i>

354
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,291
<i>Though I didn't believe it myself.</i>

355
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,583
<i>And nobody else believed me either.</i>

356
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,416
[Dengler] <i>During the course of Stalingrad,</i>

357
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,916
<i>my whole world collapsed.</i>

358
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:27,083
<i>I saw this corpse.</i>

359
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,000
<i>Some soldiers threw themselves onto him.</i>

360
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,125
<i>They cut out his heart
and lungs and ate them.</i>

361
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:55,625
I thought, my God, how low have we sunk?

362
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,666

369

370
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:19,500
[narrator] It's a disaster for Hitler
and his biggest defeat of the war so far.

371
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:29,458
[Bechler] <i>Then I started thinking of home.</i>

372
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:34,916
<i>How can we win the war now?</i>

373
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:52,916
<i>Sooner or later all of Germany will be
surrounded like we are at Stalingrad.</i>

374
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,416
<i>That means the fall of Germany.</i>

375
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,833
<i>That cannot be.</i>

376
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,416

00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,083
an even harder battle is beginning.

383
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:23,500
To win the war, the Allies
must take the fight to enemy territory

384
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:28,000
and venture into
the most dangerous place on Earth:

385
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,416

to bomb everybody else</i>

388
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:43,583
<i>and nobody was going to bomb them.</i>

389
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:49,458

they are going to reap the whirlwind.</i>
