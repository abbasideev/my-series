00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:27,208
<i>I said, "Okay, that's good by me."
So that was it.</i>

335
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,291
<i>Then the white soldiers cursed us out</i>

336
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,666
<i>and called us all kinds of names,
saying, "You don't belong up here."</i>

337
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:42,041
<i>I tried to block it out of my mind.</i>

338
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,833
<i>I was just proud that I was part
of one of the first Black tank outfits.</i>

339
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:55,791
{\an8}[Leonard] <i>It was a tight bond. Very close.</i>

340
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,083
<i>It was family.</i>

341
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,833
<i>We wanted to prove we were
the best tank outfit over there.</i>

342
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,458
<i>We wanted to show them how good we were.</i>

343
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,583
[newscaster]
<i>The weather was pretty bad today.</i>

344
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,041
<i>The ground forces need
all the help they can get now,</i>

345
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:19,333
<i>because this is
a very tough fight they are in.</i>

346
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:20,833
[wind whistling]

347
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,875
[William] <i>It was snowing.</i>

348
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,291
<i>Tanks sliding all over the road.</i>

349
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,041
<i>But we wasn't gonna chicken and run out.</i>

350
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:18,083
<i>We were rolling through this open field.</i>

351
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,875
<i>And this German tank came out of nowhere.</i>

352
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,375
[thunderous explosion]

353
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:44,916
[Leonard] <i>We got hit.</i>

354
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,291
<i>And so we had to
get out of the tank and run.</i>

355
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,916
<i>It was a suicide mission.</i>

356
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,583
[machine guns firing]

357
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,250
[soldier in German] Fire!

358
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,833
<i>And them Germans shot everything
they could throw at us, trying to kill us.</i>

359
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,541
<i>We crawled 5,000 yards in the snow.</i>

360
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,166
{\an8}[William] <i>There was Germans everywhere.</i>

361
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,500
<i>And I said,
"Well, this is it. I've had it."</i>

362
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:42,166
<i>And Smitty said, "Man, you can't stop now.
You've gotta keep going."</i>

363
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,708
<i>"You gotta get back home."</i>

364
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,166
[missile whistles past]

365
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,125
[machine guns firing]

366
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,500
<i>And because of him, I kept going.</i>

367
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,208
[soldier] Run! Run! Run!

368
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,541
[narrator] Suddenly, the weather clears.

369
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:16,708
And Allied bombers
can strike enemy positions at will.

370
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,416
The Germans are forced to retreat.

371
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,166
[William] <i>I saw this SS soldier.
Stuck my pistol up under his chin.</i>

372
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,583
<i>And I said, "Surrender."</i>

373
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:50,916
<i>Well, he said,
"I don't surrender to you niggers."</i>

374
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:58,416
Yeah, now, see, if he said, "I don't
surrender to you American soldiers,"

375
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,625
it'd have been fine with me,
I'd have taken his gun.

376
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,750
But when he said,
"I don't surrender to you niggers"

377
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:06,541
and spoke perfect English,
that's when I slapped him in the mouth.

378
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,666
[newscaster] <i>And the huge roundup
of beaten Nazis left behind continues.</i>

379
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:16,375
<i>The prisoner count
for Friday alone was almost 20,000.</i>

380
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,958
[narrator] As 1944 comes to a close,

381
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:23,500
Hitler's armies
are falling back in disarray.

382
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,416
[missile whistling past]

383
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,000
[Roosevelt]
<i>Our enemies still fight fanatically,</i>

384
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:34,875
<i>but they themselves know that
they and their evil works are doomed.</i>

385
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,041
[newscaster] <i>American troops
are moving in from north, west and south.</i>

386
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,791
[narrator] The road to Berlin is now open.

387
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,833
{\an8}[newscaster]
<i>Everybody is a little afraid of Berlin,</i>

388
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,375
{\an8}<i>but everybody wants to go there.</i>

389
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,125
[subdued theme song playing]
