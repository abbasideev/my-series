[Gerda] <i>I heard planes overhead.</i>

174
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:34,125
<i>I remember they told us
the Russian front had moved closer</i>

175
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:40,458
<i>and the Germans, they were running away
from the advancing Russian army.</i>

176
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:51,375

on a march the next morning.</i>

{\an8}[Kurt] <i>We had heard
of a group of Jewish women</i>

in a vacant factory building.</i>

275
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,000
<i>And because I was German speaking,</i>

276
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:48,375
<i>I was sent in
together with a jeep of medics.</i>

277
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,000
{\an8}[Gerda] <i>A couple of days earlier,
the Germans locked us into the factory</i>

278

<i>So, the bombing timer did not connect.</i>

282
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,750
<i>And the following morning,
the doors were opened</i>

283
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,166
<i>and people called
and said the war was over.</i>

284
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:29,333
<i>A very clear view of liberation
came that morning</i>

285
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,916
<i>when I saw a car coming down the hill,</i>

286
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,500
<i>the white star on its hood
and not the swastika.</i>

287
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:48,500
[Kurt] <i>And I remember
that next to the entrance of the building,</i>

288
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,333
<i>I saw a girl standing.</i>

289
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,875
<i>And I decided to walk up to her.</i>

290
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:04,958
And I asked her in German and in English

291
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,125
whether she spoke either language,

292
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,333
and she answered me in German.

293
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:15,291
[Gerda] <i>And I said to him,
"We are Jewish, you know?"</i>

294
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,875
<i>For a very long time he didn't answer me.</i>

295
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:28,416
<i>And then his own voice
betrayed his emotion.</i>

296
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,208
He said, "So am I."

297
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,166
<i>I remember I said, "Oh!"</i>

298
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,958
<i>Of disbelief.</i>

299
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,083
<i>He looked like God to me.</i>

300
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:57,000
<i>And the impact of that,
to be liberated not only by an American,</i>

301
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,958
<i>but by a fellow Jew...</i>

302
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,458
it just, it was so totally...

303
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:08,333
I mean, I think this is when that...

304
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:14,083
that feeling of such an incredible joy
which fills your whole being,

305
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,875
it must have burst out.

306
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:19,041
I remember I couldn't get ahold of myself.

307
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,500
And then he asked a strange question.

308
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,500
He said, "May I see the other ladies?"

309
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:31,000
A form of address
we hadn't heard for six years.

310
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:37,083
I told him that most of the girls
were inside but too ill to walk.

311
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,375
And he said to me,
"Won't you come with me?"

312
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,500
<i>He held the door open for me
and let me proceed him.</i>

313
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:58,958
[Kurt] <i>It's nearly impossible to describe
the scene that I found inside</i>

314
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,916
<i>with all these women
scattered on the floor.</i>

315
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,166
<i>That was simply too overwhelming.</i>

316
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:12,333
<i>She pointed at them and then
made sort of a sweeping gesture</i>

317
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,416
<i>over this scene of devastation</i>

318
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,958
<i>and said the following words:</i>

319
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,833
<i>"Noble be man,</i>

320
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,583
<i>merciful and good."</i>

321
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,916
<i>And I could hardly believe
that she was able to summon a poem</i>

322
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,250
<i>by the German poet Goethe,
called "The Divine," at such a moment.</i>

323
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:55,250
It was a totally
shattering experience for me.

324
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,208
[Gerda] <i>Well, pretty soon trucks came,
Red Cross trucks.</i>

325
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,333
<i>They took us into hospital.</i>

326
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:16,458
<i>I was the only one
from my family who survived.</i>

327
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:26,791
{\an8}[Kurt] <i>I've never forgotten the impression
that this girl had made on me,</i>

328
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:31,791
{\an8}<i>and I made it my business to come back
to the hospital as often as I could.</i>

329
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,083
<i>The more I talked to her,</i>

330
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:41,500
<i>the more I realized
she had something very special about her.</i>

331
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:45,958
<i>So, from that point on,
a relationship developed.</i>

332

the Allies now face the prospect
