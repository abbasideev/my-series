<i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:20,178
That's why you wanted
a divorce...

3
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:23,348
'cause it would be easier
for you to cut and run,

4
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,434
instead of trying to put
our family back together!

5
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:28,478
When you're with your wife,

6
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,189
you should shut
the fuck up and listen.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,607
What you're doing,

8
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,110
how tight you're
holding on to everything,

9
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,987
you're doing it
because you're scared.

10
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:40,865
Ever since I woke up, something
has been happening to me.

11
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,492
I hear people screaming.

12
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:45,413
You're at a threshold.
The hero has to be brave.

Julie! Julie!

15
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,837
It was the boy in white.

16
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:56,715
He was the one that was
telling secrets to Christopher.

17
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:58,299
Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,135
What?

19
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,804
I told my mother
what the Boy in White said.

20
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,639
Help me, Elgin.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,184
I can save all of you.

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,485

[Fatima]
We were in the greenhouse.

24
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,197
She was trying to help me.

25
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,824
Oh, Fatima!

26
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:25,702
- I said go!

I couldn't stop.
[breathing unsteadily]

28
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:32,250
There is either something
horrible growing inside of her

29
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,544
or else this place has
finally broken her mind.

30
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:39,424
But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

31
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,969
I'm gonna leave supplies for you
at the shack twice a week.

32
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,430
Fatima!

33
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:48,099
[Elgin] It's the only place
that the baby will be safe.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,392
There is no baby!

35
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,560
Yes, there is.

36
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:52,187
It's just not yours.

37
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,731
Out of my way!

38
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:57,776

I'm not going back
to town without her, Dad.

43
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,542
Listen, Ellis,
she took the talisman.

44
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:16,377
So what? All right,
she wouldn't just leave.

45
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,213
We don't know that.
Maybe she...

Hey, listen to me.
Listen to me.

47
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:23,259
Look, we can come back out
in the morning, okay?

48
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,928
No, I'm not leaving her
out here overnight.

a little more comfortable.

00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:22,610
please, just let me go.

70
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,363
You're not a prisoner here.
I told you,

71
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:27,657
this is for your own good.

72
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,201
Hey.

73
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,288
I'm trying to protect you.

74
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:37,125
Elgin, listen to me.
I saw her.

75
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:41,462
That thing that's
been speaking to you, I saw her.

76
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,506
What she's saying isn't true.

77
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:46,551
This thing inside me,
it's not good.

78
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:50,054
It won't do good things.
Look at what happened to Tillie.

79
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:53,224
That happened because
the baby was scared.

80
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,977
- Elgin...
- It was hungry.

81
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,146
You know,
you weren't feeding it.

82
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:00,691
Fatima,
you have to stop fighting.

83
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,735

You know, wait, wait, wait.

Just listen. Listen.
It's okay. It's okay.

- Just sit.

[breathing unsteadily]

88
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,419
You need to eat.

89
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,340
The sooner you eat,
the stronger the baby will be,

90
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,635
and before you know it,
we'll be going home.

91
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,639
All of us.

92
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:35,350
The baby already helped us once.

93
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,519
The night I found out
you were pregnant,

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,901
I remembered my dream, and that
helped Boyd save the town.

95
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:47,111
Elgin, no.

96
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,197
It's so hungry, Fatima.

97
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:50,365
- Just a little.
- No.

98
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:52,909
Please?

99
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,079
You helped me so much
since I first got here.

100

Please let me help you.

how to drive, man.

boosted the Colony House van.

about those fucking ruins,

not to go back out there.

358
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,464
[straining]

359
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:26,675
[gasps]

360
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:27,719
[wood creaking]

361
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,653
Wow.

362
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:47,572
Look at you.

363
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,368
I told you when you started to
eat, things would go faster.

364
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:56,079
The baby's gonna
be here in no time.

365
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,165
You know, you should
probably put this on.

366
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,833
Those aren't going
to fit you soon.

367
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,168
I hope it's okay.

368
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,045
I had to go to the main storage.

369
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,381
I didn't want to risk
going into your room.

370
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,886
Can you help me get up?

371
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,764
Yeah. Of course.

372
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:16,224
Aah!

373
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:17,226
Ow!

374
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:21,605
No, no! No, Fatima, stop!

375
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,858
No! No! Elgin!
Stop! No! Elgin!

376
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:29,196
Help! Help! Help!

377
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,198
You can't go out there blind.
She could be anywhere.

378
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,200
Well, I'm not gonna
find her just staying here.

379
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:34,701
Okay, then, we get more people.

380
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:36,787
- Get a search party.
- How?

381
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:39,873
How? Donna is about to tell the
entire town what Fatima did.

382
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:42,042
You really think that people
are gonna be lining up to help

383
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:43,210
when they hear about that?

384
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,128
I will talk to Donna.

385
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,296
Okay, great.
Let me know how that goes.

386
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,423
Ellis! Listen!

387
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:51,301
Sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt,

388
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,136
but I don't think this can wait.

389
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,555
It's okay.
What's going on?

390
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:57,642
Is Fatima okay?

391
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:02,479
She's missing, isn't she?

392
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,731
What the fuck
do you know about that?

393
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,733
- No, what the fuck do you...
- Hey! Hey, hey!

394
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,152
That's enough.

395
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,739
Back up.

396
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,283
What happened?

397
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:18,245
It's okay.

398
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:19,955
[exhales]

399
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:23,166
I heard the voices last night

400
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,336
for the first time
since the ruins.

401
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:28,422
What'd they say?

402
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:31,591
That Fatima didn't leave on her
own, that something took her.

403
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:33,136
Wait. What?

404
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:37,514
They want you to know
that she's close.

405
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:39,142
She's afraid.

406
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,269
They were laughing.

407
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,521
- Why?
- Because...

408
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:46,524
they know you
won't find her in time.

409
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:51,654
They want you to know
you can't save her.

410
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,329
What the fuck?

411
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:11,840
What the hell is he doing?
Jesus Christ.

412
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,175
[breathing heavily]

413
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,385
Victor? Victor!
What are you doing?

414
00:23:15,386 --> 00:23:17,180
All these things...

415
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,851
I kept all these things because
I thought they could help!

416
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,812
But all they do is hurt!

417
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:29,149
I want it gone!
I want all of it gone!

418
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,151
Victor...
Wait, just...

419
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:32,986
just wait!
Hold on a second. Victor!

420
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,322
- Whoa, hey. What's going on?
- Get out of my way.

421
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:36,531
Not until you calm down.

422
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:37,824
I said, get out of my way!

423
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,577
Okay, yeah. Here.

424
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:43,246
Victor! Hey, whoa! Hey, wait!

425
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:44,540
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Hey!

426
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:50,378
[Kenny] Victor!

427
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:51,880
Victor, what's going on?
Hey! What...

428
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:53,507
- Whoa, whoa!
- Victor!

429
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:54,883
[Acosta] Jesus!

430
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,885
Just put that down.

431
00:23:56,886 --> 00:24:00,097
- I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
- [Kenny] Okay, fine.

432
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:01,265
Then put it down.

433
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,726
I need it.

434
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,103
You're scaring people.

435
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:09,022
No.
They should be scared.

436
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,108
They're...
no one's scared enough.

437
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,400
Victor, please.

438
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,236
I was... I was...

439
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:19,950
I was so stupid!

440
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:21,368
Yeah, I was...

441
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,870
Just... let me go, please.
Please!

442
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:26,540
If you tell us what
you need the axe for.

443
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,669
I'm gonna go chop down a tree.

444
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:39,136
I'm just gonna
go back to the house.

445
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:41,054
No, come on.
You need to eat something.

446
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:42,556
Come on.

447
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:44,891
Hey, guys.

448
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,977
Nice to see the place
up and running again.

449
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:49,729
Mm. I had a little help.

450
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,733
This guy helped a lot with the
cleaning and the reorganizing.

451
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,569
You know, any time you
wanna come and lend a hand,

452
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,778
I could always use a helper.

453
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,572
Well, you hear that?

454
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:00,073
[Jim] Hmm?

455
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:02,242
You know,
Kenny was really supportive.

456
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:03,743
Hmm.

457
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,078
I think it was hard for him

458
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,581
to see this place empty
all the time.

459
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:09,291
And after what happened
to Tillie,

460
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,918
I think people need
a place that feels normal.

461
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,420
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course.

462
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:15,130
Did they find who did it to her?

463
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:16,716
Not yet.

464
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,467
Just... eat.

465
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:20,927
- Yeah.
- Grab something.

466
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:23,973
- I'll get us a couple of plates.
- Yeah.

467
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:28,768
[knocking]

468
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,730
Busy.

469
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,733
[Boyd] It's Boyd.

470
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:36,860
[sighs]
Come in.

471
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,321
[door opens]

472
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:43,950
Look, look, I know you're
upset with me, okay,

473
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:45,452
but there's something that...

474
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:47,037
I'm not gonna say anything...

475
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,623
about what Fatima did

476
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:53,043
because of what she
means to people here...

477
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:57,464
her spirit, her light.

478
00:25:57,465 --> 00:26:00,009
I don't think
people could take it.

479
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,264
I don't think I can take it.

480
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,934
She's gone.

481
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:11,478
What?

482
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:15,565
I had her in that shed
just outside of town.

483
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:19,319
Ellis and I went there last
night and she was gone.

484
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,155
She left?

485
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:25,659
Those voices that Sara hears?

486
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,994
They said something took her.

487
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,164
That she's close by,

488
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:33,333
but we won't be able to
save her before it's too late.

489
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,128
She said the voices
were laughing.

490
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,548
Fuck this place.

491
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,428
Ring the bell.
We'll call a meeting.

492
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,519
[Bakta]
What can I get you?

493
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,354
What?
You don't like your food?

494
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,899
I miss Tian-Chen's pancakes.

495
00:26:58,276 --> 00:26:59,526
Hey, where you going?

496
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:01,612
I'm going to the bathroom.

497
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:08,285
He thinks it's his fault,
what happened to me.

498
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:10,078
Why would he?

499
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,080
Because I asked him
what I should do,

500
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,957
if I should go
inside the ruins or not.

501
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,918
I know it was stupid. I just...

502
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,587
[sighing]
...it felt so much like

503
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:21,881
one of those stories he
always used to tell us,

504
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:26,386
and I was afraid, and
I didn't know who else to ask.

505
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:27,554
And no offense, but this whole

506
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:29,139
"perfect family
breakfast" thing,

507
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,932
I know what you're
trying to do, but it's...

508
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,559
it's not making anything better.

509
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,144
It's just making
everything worse.

510
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:37,981
[bell ringing]

511
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:39,107
- [bell ringing]
- Everybody!

512
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,442
- Come on.
- Come on!

513
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:41,943
[bell ringing]

514
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:43,445
[Julie] What's going on?

515
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,238
- I don't know.
- [bell ringing]

516
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,616
[bell ringing]

517
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:51,578
We're gonna need everyone
to come outside a minute.

518
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:52,579
- Come on.
- [chattering]

519
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,289
- Let's go.
- Mom?

520
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,582
- Come on.
- [Batka] What's happening?

521
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,751
You guys go. I'll...
I'll wait for Ethan.

522
00:27:57,752 --> 00:27:58,836
Okay.

523
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,050
Fill in. Over here.

524
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,763
Dad, what are you doing?

525
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:11,806
It's okay.

526
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,392
We're okay.

527
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:22,651
[Kenny] Come on over.

528
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:27,030
[Donna] All right, everyone,
listen up!

529
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:31,534
What happened to Tillie,
we know you're all scared.

530
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,536
We know you want answers.

531
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,622
- [door closes]
- [Donna] I want answers too.

532
00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:36,956
But right now,
we don't have them.

533
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:38,958
What's going on?

534
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:39,876

- Fatima's missing?

Nobody's, uh...

542
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:59,522
nobody's seen her
since last night.

[Donna] What we're asking for
is a search party.

544
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:06,653
People to scour the town,
every corner,

545
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:09,030

so we can bring her home.

546
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:12,575
Whatever took her,
is that what killed Tillie?

547
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,369
We don't know.

548
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,831
Look, I don't have all the
information on what happened.

549
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,417
All I know is
that she's close by.

550
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:21,585
How do you know that?

551
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,383
I know that because
something here told us,

552
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:31,386
something that...

553
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:34,764
that wants us to know that
she's alone, that she's afraid.

554
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:37,851

don't have what it takes

555

to find her.

tell anybody what to do.

those things in the woods,

560

they would come out at night

561
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,077

whoever the fuck they wanted.

couldn't break us.

566

to break us again.

lay down and die or...
