[Tabitha] I saw something

My mother said it would take her
to the tower, to the children.

Every time I see something
really weird, I see this symbol.

178
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:14,216
about to smash
the, uh, music box,

179
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:16,510
that thing that was
talking to me,

180
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,720
telling me to give up,

181
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:22,057
that hope is what
the forest fed on...

182
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:26,896
that thing, whatever it was,
it sure as hell wasn't my wife.

183
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,066
So, what are you?

184
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,528
I'm afraid I can't
answer that for you, Boyd.

185
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,864
[Ethan] Stop!

186
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,866
[Tian-Chen speaking Cantonese]

187
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,075
[Ethan]
No! Let me go!

188
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,911
[Tian-Chen speaking Cantonese]

189
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,081
[sighs]

190
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,126
[groaning]

191
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,961
[Ethan] We have to help her!
Stop! Let me go!

192
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:54,089
[Tian-Chen speaking Cantonese]

193
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,550
- Let me go!
- [speaking Cantonese]

194
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:58,719
No! Let me go!

195
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,721
- [speaking Cantonese]
- Ethan!

196
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,890
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

197
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,558
You told them, didn't you?

198
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,893
Hey, I'm talking to you.

199
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:08,103
[Ethan]
Why'd you tell them?

200
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:09,730
[sighs]

201
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,566
We have to go find Mom!

202
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,401
We can't just leave
her out there!

203
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:16,069
- We have to do something!
- [Jim] I know.

204
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,990
Just, uh, go inside,
all right? Just go.

205
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,285
Dad!

206
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:25,955
You found him.

207
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:27,957
Good.

208
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,253
Hey, uh...

209
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:36,089
Yeah, I...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

210
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,967
Julie.

211
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:43,473
It's not your fault, Dad.
None of this is your fault.

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,774
Jim?

213
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,527
Uh...

214
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,988
[exhales heavily]

215
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,701
[Boyd]
You know you can't do this.

216
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:07,371
I never should have let her go.
I'm not gonna just sit around.

217
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:10,791
Jim, you can't be
in the woods overnight.

218
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,125
My son just tried to run away so
that he could go look for her.

219
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,795
My daughter is still
refusing to talk about

220
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:17,631
whatever happened
to her when she, uh...

221
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:20,801
[sighs]
My kids need their mom.

222
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:22,219
What am I supposed to do?

223
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,638
I don't know.
But it can't be this.

224
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,182
I'll keep
a talisman in the tent.

225
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,396
Jim, wait. Jim!

226
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:34,314
Listen, I... Jim!

227
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:37,401
I already tried that, when
I went into the woods with Sara,

228
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:40,821
and our tent got dragged God
knows where by God knows what.

229
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,823
You still made it back okay.

230
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:45,242
Yeah, by the skin
of my goddamn teeth.

231
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,536
I'm not having
this conversation.

232
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,663
You know as well as I do that
the odds are she's already...

233
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,374
[Jim] Don't!

234
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,294
Don't you fucking dare.

235
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:58,590
What's goin' on?

236
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,383
I'm gonna go look for my wife.

237
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:04,845
All right, wait,
just hold on a second.

238
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:09,391
If you're gonna go, there might
be a safer way to do this.

239
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,685
[coughing]

240
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,520
[pounding on door]

241
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,772
Come on! You've been in there
almost an hour already!

242
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,190
Just give me a second.

243
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:21,278
You said that 15 minutes ago!
Come on!

244
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,864
[gasps]

245
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,574
[indistinct conversations]

246
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,244
I can't wait any longer!

247
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,416
[pounding on door]

248
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,253
[turns off faucet]

249
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:40,131
Hurry up!
What are you doing in there?

250
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:47,472
[pounding on door]

251
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,561
It's bad enough you're
getting double rations

252
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,563
without you hogging
the bathroom.

253
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,649
Whoa. Back off, Nicky.

254
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,900
Eat shit, Clara.

255
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,610
Hey, is there a problem?

256
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:04,489
Yeah, there's a problem.
I'm about to piss on the floor.

257
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,575
Screw her.

258
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,077
[door locking]

259
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:11,411
[Ellis] You doing okay?

260
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,039
Yeah, I'm fine.

261
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:17,084
Baby, you really
gotta eat something.

262
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,169
I will. I just...

263
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,963
My stomach
just hasn't been right.

264
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,256
I just gotta rest.

265
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,135
There's two of you
I gotta worry about now.

266
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,305
I'll be okay.

267
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:38,438
The first couple of months
can be hard, but...

268
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,650
- Yeah.
- ...she'll be all right.

269
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:47,031
Ellis, we've got work to do.

270
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,117
Isn't it too soon to harvest?

271
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,536
We've already lost
half our crop to the storm.

272
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:55,122
I don't wanna risk losing
what little we have left,

273
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,333
hoping the ground
doesn't freeze.

274
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,128
Has he slept yet?

275
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,004
[sighs] I don't know.

276
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,965
[sighs]

277
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,633
We got bigger
things to deal with.

278
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,679
Round up some bodies.
Meet me out in the field.

279
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,641
The day that Sara and I found
the lighthouse in the woods,

280
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,977
we started out
at the little stone hut

281
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:18,687
where I found the talismans.

282
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:23,316
We were also in a tent that got
dragged who knows where.

283
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,736
But if you start out
in the hut each morning,

284
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:29,489
you're at least starting closer
to what you're trying to find,

285
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,032
and you've got a place
to come back to at night,

286
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,659
so you don't
get yourself killed.

287
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,370
Makes sense. Thanks.

288
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,498
Uh, wait. You said you and Sara
both made camp in there?

289
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,376
Yeah. Why?

290
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,254
I'm gonna go with him.

291
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:46,132
Can I talk to you outside?

292
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,930
Hey. Hey!

293
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,515
[sighs]

294
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,518
Look, look, I know what
you're gonna say, okay?

295
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,854
But there's no way we can
let him go out there alone.

296
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,690
I get... I get why
you're afraid to go back...

297
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,610
- I am not afraid...
- Yes! Yes, you are,

298
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:10,363
and you've got a lot
of reasons to be, Boyd.

299
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,616
[sighs] But someone's
gotta make sure

300
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,367
that Jim comes back
in one piece.

301
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,744
I know what it's like
to lose a parent here,

302
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,746
and I'm not gonna
watch Julie and Ethan

303
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,082
lose both their parents
in the same week.

304
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,754
We can't play
defense forever, Boyd.

305
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,674
What the fuck?

306
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,095
What the fuck is...

307
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,644
Jade?

308
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,729
[Jade]
They tried to show me.

309
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,398
I don't see it.

310
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,111
I can't see it. I can't see it.
[muttering]

311
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,155
They tried to show me.

312
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:53,907
What's he talking about?

313
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:55,575
No idea.

314
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,744
- [Jade] I don't understand it.
- Did you know about this?

315
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,454
[Jade]
They're trying to show me.

316
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,165
I mean, I knew he was pretty
obsessed with that drawing,

317
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,251
but this is... insane.

318
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,086
I can't... I can't see it.

319
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:10,216
I can't... Fuck.
I can't see it.

320
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,093
Yeah, I'll get that boarded up.

321
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,427
- No.
- [Jade] I can't see it.

322
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,304
Help me take him
back to the station.

323
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,431
- He can sleep it off.
- [Jade] I can't see it.

324
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,100
- I can't...
- I'm gonna help you, buddy.

325
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,351
- No, no.
- [Boyd] No, no, no, no.

326
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,020
[Kenny] It's all right. Hey!
Let's do this.

327
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,605
- I gotta see... I gotta...
- No, no.

328
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,524
- I gotta figure this out!
- Just stand up.

329
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,526
- Ready?
- [groaning]

330
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:33,322
[indistinct conversations]

331
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,879
It's so cute.
It's amazing, like...

332
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,214
Look at this.

333
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,594
[girl]
Oh, that's really cute.

334
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,555
[camera clicking]

335
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,516
Let me get one of the two of us.

336
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,187
[camera shutter clicking]

337
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,481
- What's wrong?
- [Tabitha] Excuse me.

338
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,066
Hi.

339
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:13,820
Um, would it be possible for me
to borrow one of your phones?

340
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:14,821
Um, no.

341
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:15,698
Please.

342
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:18,576
- Will you be quick?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,870
Thank you.

344
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,373
[quietly]
Why would you do that?

345
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,588
Okay.

346
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:35,842
[phone line ringing]

347
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,219
[woman] <i>Hello?</i>

348
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,430
Mom?

349
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,515
<i>Tabby? Oh, God! Tabby!
Where are you?</i>

350
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,561
Mom, hi. Uh...
I'm okay. We're all okay.

351
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:48,688
<i>Ay, mija!</i>

352
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,398
Yeah.

353
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,234
<i>Where have you been?</i>

354
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,362
Um...

355
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:57,906
we had to go for
a little while, but, um...

356
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,240
<i>And you went where?</i>

357
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,242
I-I just don't want
you to worry, Mom.

358
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,536
<i>No, Tabby, the police
are looking for you</i>

359
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:06,081
<i>and Jim and the kids.
Everybody's been looking!</i>

360
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,624
I know. I know, Mom. I know.

361
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,709
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
<i>- Ay, mi amor.</i>

362
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,046
I... I... I'm gonna tell you
everything as soon as I see you.

363
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,547
<i>Please!</i> Por favor!

364
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,882
I just...

365
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,051
<i>We have been so worried!</i>

366
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:21,096
I just wanted to hear your voice
and for you to hear mine.

367
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,555
<i>Tabby!</i>

368
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,225
Mom, I love you so much,
and I miss you and...

369
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,893
<i>Ah, mi amor!</i>

370
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,230
Jim and I are doing everything
we can to come back home soon.

371
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,398
<i>Ay, que bueno.</i>

372
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,983
Everyone says hello.

373
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,901
<i>Ay, Tabby, please,
just stay on the phone.</i>

374
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,403
No, no, no.

375
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:38,571
<i>There's a police detective.
He gave me his card.</i>

376
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,907
Mom, Mom, I-I...
I can't stay here for long.

377
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,117
I'm sorry. Um...

378
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,244
<i>Okay, but you have to call him.</i>

379
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,746
- Uh...
<i>- Mi amor!</i>

380
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,416
You might not hear from me
for a little bit, but...

381
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,918
<i>No, no, no! No, no, no!
You have to stay here!</i>

382
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,254
I just don't
want you to be afraid.

383
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,922
I'm okay, okay?
Everything's okay.

384
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,257
<i>¿Ay, pero cuándo?</i>

385
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:58,758
- I love you, Mom.
<i>- Tabby!</i>

386
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,011
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I-I have to go.

387
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,680
I love you so much, okay?
Everything's okay.

388
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:05,683
[sobbing]
Mom, I love you. Bye.

389
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,273
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

390
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:14,941
Why would you do that?

391
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,819
You seriously need to
disinfect your phone now.

392
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:24,827
[breathing heavily]

393
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,623
[exhaling sharply]

394
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,461
[church bells
tolling in distance]

395
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,838
[church bells tolling]

396
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,465
[Kristi]
When are you guys leaving?

397
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,676
[Kenny]
As soon as Jim's ready.

398
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:45,972
My mom insisted on putting
together our rations.

399
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,640
Yeah, Moms'll do that.

400
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,850
Yep.

401
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,353
Are you sure about all this?

402
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,481
\Mom, that's too much.
We can't...

403
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:57,693
[in Cantonese]

404
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:03,866
Ma...

405
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,702
{\an8}[Kenny] Yes.

406
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,085
[in Cantonese]

407
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,587
It's gonna be fine!

408
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,882
You guys worry too much.

409
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,727
Are you really
gonna go find Mom?

410
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,356
Well, I'm gonna do my best.

411
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:37,941
But I can't do that

412
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,776
if I'm worried
about things back here.

413
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:42,195
So, no more running off, okay?

414
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,740
Okay.

415
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,909
Shake on it.

416
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,495
Good man.

417
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,751
I love you, Dad.

418
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,086
I love you, too.

419
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,463
Promise you'll be careful?

420
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:06,929
I promise.

421
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,437
I'll be back soon.

422
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:21,818
- Yeah.
- You got it. Okay.

423
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,404
You ready?
We're burning daylight.

424
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:25,822
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

425
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,616
Right, and remember what I
told you about those trees.

426
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,827
You start seeing spiderwebs,
then you know you are going

427
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,412
- in the right direction.
- Yeah, got it.

428
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:35,415
And whatever you do, make sure
you get back to the hut by dark.

429
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,667
Yeah.
We're gonna be okay.

430
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,752
Okay?
I'll see you soon.

431
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,505
Okay.

432
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:45,758
Hey! Dad!

433
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,635
Wha...?

434
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,806
You gotta come to the fields!
Come on!

435
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:53,766
[man] Let's see what
we can dig up...

436
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,769
[breathing heavily]

437
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,690
No, no. Please.
What are we gonna do?

438
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,192
They're all fuckin' rotten!

439
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:03,359
[gasps]

440
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,195
[groans]

441
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:07,322
[grunts]

442
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,824
[Boyd]
Donna!

443
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,660
First things we pulled up,

444
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:16,956
it was a few rotten carrots,
beets and potatoes.

445
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:20,501
So, we pulled up some more.
They were rotten too.

446
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:24,173
Everything that survived
the storm is rotten.

447
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:28,844
Boyd, we're out of food.

448
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,138
How many people did you
have up here with you?

449
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,806
Donna!

450
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,516
How many people know?

451
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:38,311
- [shouting indistinctly]
- Go! You go home now!

452
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,562
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

453
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,980
But every ounce of
food we have left

454
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,899
is in those jars
in your basement!

455
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,693
You have no right to keep
it locked away down there!

456
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:46,528
No!

457
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,154
Those for everybody!

458
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,697
There more crop coming!

459
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,491
You don't know what
you're talking about.

460
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:52,533
Everything else is rotten!

461
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,244
This is all
the food we have now!

462
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:55,328
No!

463
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,871
Please go home!

464
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,331
Go home!

465
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,541
No, my house! No!

466
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,043
Come on.

467
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,711
What are you doing?

468
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:06,923
You're not... look, kid, I don't
like this any more than you do,

469
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,675
but the shit is
on the fan, all right?

470
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:09,842
You can't!
She's my friend!

471
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,345
- Enough, all right?
- Stop! Stop!

472
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,680
The kid is one thing,

473
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,765
but you, I'm gonna
fucking hit, all right?

474
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,891
Randall, what are you doing?

475
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,185
- Hey, hey!
- I said, "Stop."

476
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,020
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Ellis] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

477
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,689
- Victor, don't. No, no, no!
- Just...

478
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,607
No, no! Hey, hey!
Stop, stop, stop! Victor?

479
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,401
Hey, hey, hey.

480
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,278
So, this guy's got a gun?
Are you fucking kidding me?

481
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,697
Is that seriously what you're
focusing on right now?

482
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:33,700
Hey. Put it down, buddy.

483
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:37,370
Victor? Victor...

484
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,123
Put it down.

485
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,543
All right. Okay.

486
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,044
Now, give me the gun, buddy.

487
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,713
No.

488
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:49,258
Please, buddy.

489
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,724
[Randall] Great.

490
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,559
Can I take my goat now, huh?

491
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,313
Those animals are off-limits.

492
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:05,732
Those animals are the only food
that we have now.

493
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,233
That's right.

494
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,485
They provide eggs.
They provide milk.

495
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,903
They are a resource.

496
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,072
And if you hadn't noticed,

497
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:16,118
we're running pretty fucking
thin on those these days.

498
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,997
Listen, what happened today...

499
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,290
Uh, hey...

500
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:26,753
what happened today
was a setback, and I get it.

501
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:28,588
I get that we're scared.

502
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,423
I get that...
I get that we're hungry.

503
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:33,009
But we are...

504
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,304
Look, we are
still in this thing.

505
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:39,098
We can still win.

506
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,810
But whatever we do,
we have to do it carefully.

507
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:48,317
We have to make
everything last. Okay?

508
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,820
This place will not break us!

509
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:57,910
The only way we go home...
is together.

510
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,329
Okay?

511
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:04,123
So...

512
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:08,461
So, give us time
to figure this out.

513
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,172
Give me that.

514
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,761
Or...

515
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,347
...we can do this,

516
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:22,184
right here, right now.

517
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:27,773
[sighs]
Just give him the goat.

518
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,485
You people don't
have any fucking idea.

519
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,363
You don't.

520
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,120
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

521
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,830
Hey, bud.

522
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,373
- You okay?
- You okay?

523
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:48,709
Should we take Alma back?
Hey, could you...?

524
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,836
Yeah.

525
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,047
- Come on, Alma.
- [goat bleats]

526
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:58,929
I appreciate what you're doing.
I want you to know that.

We should probably get up
to some higher ground,

705
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,832
see if we can't get
a lay of the land.

706
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,543
[rustling, twigs snapping]

707
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,131
[rustling]

708
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,970
[rustling continues]

709
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,098

[footsteps depart]

713
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,822
[whispers] I think it's gone.

714
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,044
[Jim] We can't do this.

715
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:06,048
If I die out here,

716
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:08,927
I'll be leaving
my kids with nothing.

717
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:12,304
There's a reason she went alone.

718
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:15,974
Because if something
goes wrong...

719
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,102
one of us has
to be there for the kids.

720
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,106
If she's...

721
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:29,864
She wouldn't want me out here.

722
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:37,872
We'll head home
first thing in the morning.

723
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,335

726
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,253
[groans] Oh, fuck.

727
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:29,214
[exhales deeply] Hey.

728
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,009
Hi.

729
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,762
Want a little hair of the dog?

730
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,602
Oh, you been holding out.

731
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,605
[chuckles]
Where'd this come from?

732
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:48,567
Father Khatri
buried it in a sack

733
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:51,236
with a bloody shirt
and a candy bar.

734
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:54,406
[laughs] What?

735
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:56,200
It's a long story.

736
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:00,330
You ready to tell me
what's going on with you?

737
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,124
Not yet.

738
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,127
Still kinda
working it out for myself.

739
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:08,962
But, uh...

740
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,590
I don't think we're
doing very well here, Sheriff.

741

- Hmm.

No! That... No!

748
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:30,984
- No, no, no!
- What the hell you doing?!

749
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:34,363
There's goddamn cows

Come on, Ginger, good girl.

00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:56,134
We'll put up a talisman
if we have to, okay?

760
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:57,803
