00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,962
Uh, Jade, you're never gonna
make it back before dark.

536
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:03,589
Well, I'm sure as fuck
not staying here!

537
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,300
Let's all just take
a breath, okay?

538
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:08,969
I played along with the whole
"Let's draw straws

539
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,930
to see who gets the food"
bullshit.

540
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:12,390
- I came out here to help!
- Okay.

541
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:13,641
I don't like it here.

542
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:14,934
Who the fuck likes it anywhere?

543
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:16,477
It's a forest
full of nightmares!

544
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:18,312
No. This is different.
This is diff... Look.

545
00:30:18,313 --> 00:30:20,940
I wanna help. I do, okay?
I wanna help, but I...

546
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:22,817
I'll be more helpful
back in town.

547
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:24,902
Hey, hey, hey, hey! You're not
gonna make it back to town.

548
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,904
Okay? You might not even make it
back to the talisman hut,

549
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,572
so just breathe, okay?

550
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:29,907
I'll make it if I run.

551
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:32,660
[Kenny] Just stop.
Okay. Stop. Stop.

552
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:33,994
We have shelter here.

553
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:35,830
We have...
we have talismans here,

554
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,331
and we need this food.

555
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,500
Jade, if we go
back to town empty-handed,

556
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:40,877
people starve.

557
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:43,671
Good luck.

558
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:45,589
- Jade!
- [Kenny] He's right.

559
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,091
If he hurries, he'll probably
make it back to the talisman hut

560
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:48,134
before sundown.

561
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:49,844
- Jade!
- [Kenny] Kristi!

562
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,679
[Kristi] Jade, hold on!
You're going the wrong way!

563
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,306
- Jade!
- [scoffing]

564
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:55,392
Kristi!

565
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:57,768
[Kristi]
Jade, just hold on!

566
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,270
You don't even know
where you're going!

567
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:00,938
Will you just stop
for two seconds

568
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,273
and think about
what you're doing?

569
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:03,607
Oh, trust me.
I've done nothing

570
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:05,276
but think about what I'm doing!

571
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:07,361
I shouldn't be out here!
I should be back at the bar,

572
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:08,821
trying to figure out how to...

573
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:11,031
- Ah! Fuck!
- Kristi!

574
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,199
- Ah!
- Kristi!

575
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,701
Ah! My foot...

576
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:16,036
- Hey! Fuck! Get... get off her!
- [grunting]

577
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:18,038
- What the fuck did you do?
- What the hell?

578
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,790
{\an8}It's not his fault! Just get
this fucking thing off of me!

579
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,042
- [Dale] Uh...
- [Kristi groaning]

580
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:24,254
There should be a release
somewhere. I don't know.

581
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,547
- Ow!
- Yes.

582
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,048
[Kristi]
Get this fucking thing off.

583
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,717
[Jade] Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:31,218
[Kristi groaning]

585
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:32,678
[Kenny] You're okay.
Breathe.

586
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,305
- [groaning]
- What the fuck?

587
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:35,639
Okay. I got it.

588
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,350
- You're okay.
- [Kristi groaning]

589
00:31:38,477 --> 00:31:39,894
- [snapping]
- [Jade shouting]

590
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,520
- [Kristi shouting]
- Oh, fuck.

591
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:45,525
[Kristi groaning]

592
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:55,911
How's this?

593
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:57,745
Looks good to me.

594
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:59,580
Why don't you take
all these in the back

595
00:31:59,581 --> 00:32:00,915
and get them cleaned?

596
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,250
Okay.

597
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,086
Hey, little man.

598
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,838
Hi, Sheriff.

599
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,423
And what are you guys up to?

600
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:11,675
[Ethan] We're just making sure
everything's clean

601
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,970
and put away the way
Tian-Chen would like it.

602
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:16,806
Oh, wow.
That's really...

603
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:21,561
I'm sure she appreciates that.

604
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:23,647
I hope so.

605
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:26,733
[door swinging]

606
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,694
Came down here to get
one of the big pots

607
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:32,238
for soup for Colony House,

608
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:35,158
and when I got here,
I found him cleaning.

609
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:38,202
Poor kid.

610
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:40,497
He's had so much
to deal with already.

611
00:32:42,624 --> 00:32:44,291
And what about you?

612
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:45,292
How you doing?

613
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,253
[scoffing]

614
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:48,712
Aside from trying to process

615
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:51,298
everything
that's happened recently,

616
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,050
including how a nursery rhyme

617
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:55,345
my grandmother told me
somehow...

618
00:32:57,013 --> 00:32:58,764
[sighing]
I... I don't know

619
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:01,392
how I'm doing,
if I'm being honest.

620
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:02,601
Do you?

621
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:04,144
[sighing]

622
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:05,522
It's been a rough stretch.

623
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:08,024
Is it always like this?

624
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,985
Does it get worse?

625
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:13,112
I mean, well,
if I'm being honest,

626
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:14,154
I don't know.

627
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:17,116
But... but I do know

628
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:19,660
that no matter
what this place throws at us,

629
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:22,621
we're gonna win, all right?

630
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,498
No matter what happens here,

631
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:26,459
we are going
to find our way home.

632
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:29,045
What if there isn't one?

633
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:32,089
Well, of course there is.

634
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,174
There's a way here, right?

635
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:36,510
If there's a way here,
there's a way home.

636
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:37,928
You don't know that.

637
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,139
You just hope there is.

638
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,475
Tian-Chen thought she was
going home, and so did my mom.

639
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:47,397
Hey, we are not giving up
on your mom, okay?

640
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:49,691
Maybe you should.

641
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:55,029
[door swinging]

642
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,239
Yeah.

643
00:33:58,617 --> 00:34:00,367
- [Kenny grunting]
- [Kristi groaning]

644
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,036
- [men grunting]
- [Kristi groaning]

645
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:04,496
- I'm sorry.
- [Dale grunting]

646
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:06,206
[groaning]

647
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:08,542
This thing must have been here
for decades at least.

648
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:10,336
It's a good thing, too,
'cause all that rust and crap

649
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:12,046
- probably saved your foot.
- Lucky me.

650
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:13,797
Let's see if I can
wedge this in there.

651
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:15,299
- Okay. Just back up. Back up.
- I'm just trying to help.

652
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,009
You've helped! Gimme that.

653
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,719
You wanna go back to town, go!
Get the fuck outta here.

654
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,387
Kenny, we gotta get
this thing off her leg

655
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:21,972
before the sun goes down!

656
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,807
Really, Jade? Thanks!
Get the fuck outta here!

657
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,226
Enough!
This is nobody's fault,

658
00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:28,729
so just cut the shit
and let's figure this out!

659
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,314
Why don't we just
break the chain?

660
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,899
At least then
we could get her inside.

661
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,526
- Break it with what?
- I don't know, smart guy.

662
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,654
You're supposed
to be the genius.

663
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:38,739
[Kristi groaning]

664
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,074
[Kenny]
Sorry. I'm sorry.

665
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:41,367
[cracking]

666
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:42,701
- [snapping]
- [Shouting]

667
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:43,911
- [Kristi groans]
- [Kenny] Sorry.

668
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:45,913
- [Kristi groans]
- Fuck!

669
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:48,582
We need something that's
gonna give us more leverage.

670
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,708
All right, we need...

671
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:52,419
[crows cawing in distance]

672
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,338
You, come with me.

673
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:55,881
What?

674
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:58,509
Just don't do anything
until we get back!

675
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,552
[groaning]

676
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:04,723
[chattering]

677
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:06,976
I know they're here somewhere.

678
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,562
Poor thing's exhausted.

679
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:12,982
I'm glad he's finally
getting some rest.

680
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:17,654
Ah. Here they are.

681
00:35:25,328 --> 00:35:26,954
Those what I think they are?

682
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:29,081
They are if you think
they're tarot cards.

683
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:30,624
You can't be serious.

684
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,794
Oh. You wanna know
if your baby's all right?

685
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:35,588
These here are gonna tell us.

686
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:40,467
This was a bad idea.

687
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:42,011
Hey!
Where are you going?

688
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:44,888
Where am I going?

689
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,807
I opened up to you.

690
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,102
I confided in you. I...

691
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:53,480
You know what? Your whole kooky,
batty Tillie shtick

692
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:56,984
is fine in most circumstances,
but how dare you?

693
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:59,112
Now, hold on a second.

694
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,489
Is that what you think of me?

695
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:04,158
Kooky, batty Tillie,

696
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,162
just goofing around about
something this important to you?

697
00:36:08,163 --> 00:36:10,164
Is that what you think of me?

698
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:12,249
I don't know.

699
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,627
I don't know anything about you.
Look. Just...

700
00:36:15,628 --> 00:36:19,006
Now so, you don't believe.

701
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:20,507
That's fine,

702
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,843
but before you saw
that tree in the road,

703
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:25,804
I'll bet you didn't believe
in half the stuff we see here

704
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:29,141
every day and night, did you?

705
00:36:29,142 --> 00:36:33,353
These things played
a pretty big role in my life

706
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:35,398
at a pretty critical juncture.

707
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:38,651
I just want to share
that with you.

708
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,535
These cards were given to me
