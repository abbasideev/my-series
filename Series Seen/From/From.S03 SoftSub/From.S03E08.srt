00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:55,301
you and Fatima were
with me last night. Okay?

183
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:57,220
What if we just tell them
the truth

184
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,138
and explain what happened?

185
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,099
- Ellis...
- That it wasn't her fault.

186
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,767
I know. I know.

187
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:05,103
Maybe some of those people
will understand that.

188
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:08,022
There's no version of us
explaining this away.

189
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,024
Look, they're
gonna put her in the Box.

190
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,527
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Look at me.

191
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,403
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Get yourself together.

192
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:17,573
Go in there,
get up to your room,

193
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:21,244
put some things in a bag.
Don't pack too much,

194
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,454
just enough for her
to spend a couple days

195
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:25,164
out there at the shack.

196
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:26,457
And what are you gonna do?

197
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,792
I'm gonna... [clears throat]

198
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:30,295
- [Kenny] Boyd!
- ...buy us some time. Hey!

199
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,759
[Kenny] Hey, uh...
We found something.

200
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:49,605
Anyone see anything?

201
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:52,859
Uh, not that we've...

202
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,360
Not that we've heard so far.

203
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:57,488
Any idea when this happened?

204
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,991
Could've been this morning.
It could've been last night.

205
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:02,118
There's not a whole
lot of people coming in,

206
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,704
with the snow and everything.

207
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,706
[Acosta] Those things
that come out at night,

208
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:09,250
I'm guessing they don't
use gardening shears?

209
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,836
No.

210
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:14,338
We should talk to
everyone in the house.

211
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,924
[Kenny] Boyd?

212
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:23,514
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Start talking to people.

213
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,516
I'll take Ellis out
to walk the road.

214
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,268
- Walk the road?
- This could've been done

215
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,978
by people we know
or people we don't.

216
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:31,063
We need to rule out
the possibility

217
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,690
we had
any new arrivals yesterday

218
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:34,025
that we don't know about.

219
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:35,818
- [Boyd] All right?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,863
Yeah. Hey.

221
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,865
I know,
you're not my deputy, but...

222
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,575
Yeah, no, I got it.

223
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:44,702
We'll get the interviews
started.

224
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:46,246
Yeah.

225
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:51,877
Hey, Sheriff?

226
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:54,295
We good?

227
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:56,756
Let's find out who did this.

228
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,310
[gasps]

229
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,062
Hey, you okay?

230
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:13,189
Hell, we're gonna
have to talk to Sara.

231
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,984
- It wasn't her.
- [Donna] You don't know that.

232
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:20,489
And I am not the only person
who's gonna be asking about her.

233
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,326
[breathing shakily]

234
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,828
If you don't think
she did it, fine.

235
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:29,497
Then, we'll just have to...

236
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:31,165
go talk to her and make sure.

237
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,084
- Listen...
- No, no, no, you listen.

238
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:35,670
Hiding every night from
those things, that's one thing.

239
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:38,589
But this? This is something

240
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,633
that people are gonna
have to blame someone for.

241
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,219
And if we don't figure out who,

242
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,306
then it's gonna be Sara,
whether she did it or not.

243
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:49,433
Okay.

244
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:51,644
You get things
straightened out here,

245
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:55,065
then meet me at the station, and
we will talk to her together.

246
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:18,963
[Sara] "Hello, Victor.

247
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:21,257
Do you want to play today?
I can tell you a secret."

248
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:24,385
No, no, not... not like that!
I just... I told you!

249
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:25,761
It doesn't
sound like that, Sara!

250
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,346
I'm doing the best that I can!

251
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,056
I'm trying
everything that I know!

252
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:31,017
I don't know
what you want, Victor!

253
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,685
- [mumbling]
- [thudding]

254
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:34,061
- Hey, hey, hey!
- [Victor] No!

255
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,314
No! He d...
he doesn't... you need...

256
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,274
he needs to talk,
and you're not doing it right!

257
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,734
I'm doing the best that I can!

258
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,360
No, you're not
doing it good enough!

259
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,571
No, you're not good enough.
You're not good enough!

260
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,990
- Victor! Hey!
- You're not good enough!

261
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,700
- Hey, don't! Stop! Stop!
- You're not good enough!

262
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:48,994
- You're not good enough!
- Stop! Stop!

263
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:57,960
Look, I know you want
all this to mean something,

264
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:00,171
and this place has you
convinced that you need

265
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:02,048
to save these children.

266
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,760
It's got you trying to fix
something that we can never...

267
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,803
[sighs]

268
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,228
Do you know why
the phone is off the wall?

269
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,648
Because it rang the other day,

270
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:23,028
and the voice on the other end
said his name was Thomas.

271
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,243
What?

272
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:41,337
Something here
knows things about us,

273
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:44,256
and it knows
which buttons to push.

274
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:47,176
[knock on door]

275
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:49,220
[exhales]

276
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,513
[knocking continues]

277
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,474
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:55,935
I know I shouldn't
be here, but...

279
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:59,230
Victor is in my basement,
and he's in really bad shape.

280
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,025
He said he only wants
to talk to you.

281
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:06,363
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

282
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,533
Just wait there.
I'll get my coat.

283
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,744
I have to go.

284
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,204
[Elgin] Hello?

285
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,998
[door closes]

286
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,465
- Hey.
- [Elgin gasps]

287
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,259
If you're looking for drugs,
you're in the wrong spot.

288
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,927
Oh, no, no.

289
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:33,681
Uh, no, I was...
just looking for a Band-Aid.

290
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:36,058
- Oh.
- I cut my foot.

291
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,186
Mm. You better not
let Kristi or Marielle

292
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:40,897
find you rooting
through their shit.

293
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:44,900
You hear about Tillie?

294
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:46,361
Yeah.

295
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,239
It's fucked up.

296
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:56,662
Hey. I'm sorry
I was so hard on you

297
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:58,330
on the bus that day.

298
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,458
I guess you were right.

299
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,086
We should've turned around.

300
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,922
Sorry I, uh, threw up
all over your shirt.

301
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,551
[chuckles] Yeah.

302
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,433
[door opens]

303
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,979
[door closes]

304
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,450
[Sara] Victor?

305
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,247
Oh. Oh, you're here.

306
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:42,333
- [Tabitha] Hi, Victor. Hi.
- Good. Come.

307
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,793
Hey.

308
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:48,130
[grunts]
You sit... come sit here.

309
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:50,007
- Okay.
- There. Take this.

310
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:51,383
Okay.

311
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,260
- Okay.
- Victor, what are we...

312
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,971
You were there. You were there
when I remembered Eloise,

313
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:58,933
so you're the one
that can make him talk.

314
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,267
Okay, Victor, I'm so sorry.

315
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:01,810
I don't know...
I don't understand.

316
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,771
He needs to tell me!
You need to make him tell <i>me.</i>

317
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,940
[Tabitha]
Tell you what, Victor?

318
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,942
[Victor] The secrets
that he told Christopher

319
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:09,860
'cause he can help us.

320
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:12,112
[Tabitha] I'm sorry, honey.
He's... he's just a doll.

321
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:13,781
[Victor] No!
No, you have to be the one!

322
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,241
You have to be the one!

323
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,701
- Okay, okay!
- You have to be the one!

324
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,870
- [Tabitha] Victor! Hey! Hey!
- You have to be the one!

325
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:21,705
- You have to be the one!
- Hey! Victor, stop it!

326
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,457
- Stop it! Don't do that!
- You have to be the one.

327
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,543
Calm down.
Don't do that, Victor, please.

328
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:29,088
Shh. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

329
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,924
Look at me, Victor.
It's okay. You're okay.

330
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,634
- [Tabitha] You're okay.
- Okay.

331
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:34,593
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

332
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,637
Do you want to draw a picture?

333
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:41,183
No. No, it doesn't work
like that.

334
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,977
See, the pictures
always remembered

335
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,895
so that I didn't have to.

336
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:48,190
But I never drew one,

337
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,776
so now it's gone, and I can't...

338
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:52,736
I can't remember.

339
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:55,239
No. No, okay, okay.
First of all, sit down.

340
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,327
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. Sit down, okay?

341
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,663
It's okay, Victor.

342
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:04,290
Just sit down.

343
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,174
It's okay, Victor.

344
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:16,552
Nothing is gone.
Nothing's gone.

345
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:19,763
It's okay. Um...

346
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:22,224
Tell me about...
tell me about the doll.

347
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,560
His name is Jasper.

348
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:27,313
Jasper? Okay.
Uh, tell me about Jasper.

349
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,106
I heard him once,

350
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:32,610
telling Christopher things
that we need to know.

351
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,570
But I don't remember.

352
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:37,656

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,571
Is that what you think?
You think they

707
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:27,947
- understood about Sara?
- Yes.

708
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:29,156
No, no, no!
They didn't understand.

709
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:31,075
They accepted it.

710
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,535
People swallowed it.

711
00:40:32,536 --> 00:40:35,580
But they certainly
did not understand it!

712
00:40:35,581 --> 00:40:38,833
They let it go because
<i>you</i> told them they had to.

713
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:40,501
Great, then,
I will tell them again!

714
00:40:40,502 --> 00:40:43,129
- It's not gonna work this time.
- Why not?

715
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,881
Because they don't
believe in you anymore.

716
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:49,803
Not like they did.

717
00:40:51,597 --> 00:40:53,180
I'll tell them I did it.

718
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:54,807
- No, no, no!
- No, no, I'll, I'll... I did it!

719
00:40:54,808 --> 00:40:57,101
- No, no, no, it's not enough!
- Why?

720
00:40:57,102 --> 00:41:00,396
Because it doesn't change
that it made it happen

721
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:02,523
in the first place!

722
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:07,028
There is either something
horrible growing inside of her,

723
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:09,780
or else this place
has finally broken her mind!

724
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:13,869
Either way, it's only a matter
of time before it happens again!

725
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:16,454
They can stay with me.

726
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:17,622
[exhales heavily]

727
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:19,874
She won't be
a threat to anyone else.

728
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,834
I can watch her.
We can watch her.

729
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:25,671
No, no, no, Boyd. Boyd, you may
both want this to be okay,

730
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:27,798
and God knows
I want it to be okay, too.

731
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:32,762
But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

732
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:38,101
Please, don't make me do this.

733
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:50,864
[door closes]

734
00:41:57,537 --> 00:41:59,289
What are you doing?

735
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,668
You're gonna need supplies.

736
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:13,261
[Victor] It was in the basement.
It happened in the basement.

737
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:17,932
When I opened the door,
I heard voices.

738
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:21,394
So, I was quiet,
and I wanted to get closer.

739
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,734
When I got...

740
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,363
<i>to the bottom of the stairs,</i>

741
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:34,615
<i>Jasper was telling secrets.</i>

742
00:42:34,616 --> 00:42:36,117
[muted speech]

743
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:42,206
- [muted speech]
<i>- Christopher got angry.</i>

744
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:45,502
[continues, muted]

745
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:51,966
<i>No, no, that's not right.</i>

746
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,801
<i>It wasn't Jasper.</i>

747
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:56,887
[muted speech continues]

748
00:42:56,888 --> 00:42:59,682
It was the boy in white.

749
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:01,183
He was the one
that was down here.

750
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:04,228
He who was telling secrets
to Christopher.

751
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:07,690
[muted] The answers to the end
are at the beginning.

752
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:11,610
He said, "The answers to
the end are at the beginning."

753
00:43:11,611 --> 00:43:13,279
[boy in white, muted]
It started with the children.

754
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,407
That it started
with the children...

755
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:19,326
<i>- What the others did to them.</i>
- ...what the others did to them.

756
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:20,995
What others, Victor?

757
00:43:20,996 --> 00:43:23,623
The people they loved.

758
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:26,500
The people they trusted.

759
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,252
<i>The children are born
in the dark.</i>

760
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:29,837
[Victor] <i>He said the children
were born in the dark.</i>

761
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:31,547
[boy in white, muted] And then
they were murdered in the dark.

762
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:35,593
And then they were murdered...
in the dark.

763
00:43:36,678 --> 00:43:38,888
[muted] But someone
who loved them...

764
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,723
But someone who loved them...

765
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:43,726
<i>- ...told them a story.</i>
- ...told them a story.

766
00:43:43,727 --> 00:43:46,687
The story gave them hope.

767
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:50,274
And when the children
laid on the stones,

768
00:43:50,275 --> 00:43:52,401
they poured their hope

769
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:54,445
into the roots
that made the symbol,

770
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:55,905
and those roots became the tree.

771
00:43:55,906 --> 00:43:57,740
The Faraway Tree.

772
00:43:57,741 --> 00:43:59,742
The boy in white was
trying to tell Christopher

773
00:43:59,743 --> 00:44:03,496
that to save the children...

774
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:05,831
he would have
to go through the tree.

775
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:08,584
But he wouldn't...
he wouldn't listen, and he...

776
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:10,377
he got angry.

777
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:13,589
[muted] You're a liar!
Everything lies here!

778
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,218
Christopher
wouldn't listen, so I-I...

779
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,599
What?

780
00:44:23,892 --> 00:44:26,561
Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

781
00:44:31,691 --> 00:44:34,694
I told my mother
what the boy in white said.

782
00:44:39,116 --> 00:44:41,659
And that's why she left us.

783
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:54,964
[Elgin] Fatima?

784
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:57,508
It's Elgin.

785
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:00,178
[door creaks open]

786
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,972
You...

787
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:10,104
Okay, stay close, all right?
But not too close.

788
00:45:10,105 --> 00:45:13,649
Four or five hours out,
that should be, uh, enough.

789
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,484
[Ellis] Okay.

790
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:18,320
And, whatever you do, you stay
off the path to the settlement.

791
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:22,283
Last thing we want is anybody
tripping over your tent.

792
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:27,454
I'm gonna leave supplies for
you at the shack twice a week.

793
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:30,207
You need anything,
you leave a note behind.

794
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,001
- Okay.
- You bring a pen and pad?

795
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:33,669
Yeah, it's in the pack.

796
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,171
And if things...

797
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:42,846
Look, if things get worse,
you promise me that you'll...

798
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:50,102
Look, um, Dad,

799
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:54,064
I know you don't
want me to do this,

800
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:58,611
but if you'd had the chance,
if you and Mom coulda ran,

801
00:45:58,612 --> 00:46:00,446
even after she did
what she did...

802
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,948

803
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:09,413

It's...

to be this close to town?
