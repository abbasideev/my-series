00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,385
You came into my house,

179
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,345
you made me sit
in that fort, and now...

180
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,140
Donna said my dad is here.

181
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,684
What? How?

182
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,477
It doesn't matter.
You should go home.

183
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:19,314
Uh, we'll get Jasper later.

184
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,112
So, what was it like?

185
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:30,491
Uh, it was, um...

186
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,536
You know, it was scary,
waking up in the hospital,

187
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:39,083
not knowing if it was real
or if I was still dreaming.

188
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,043
So, you really
talked to Grandma?

189
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:43,130
I did.

190
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,216
I just... I just
don't understand.

191
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,719
How do you go from
a lighthouse in the woods

192
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,512
to a hospital in Maine?

193
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:54,390
Honey, I don't...
I don't know.

194
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,726
I wish I could explain.

195
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:01,189
The important thing is
that she's back,

196
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,482
- and we're all together.
- [door opens]

197
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,068
- [Jade] Hey!
- [door closes]

198
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,446
- I need to talk to you.
- Hey. Back off, man.

199
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:10,031
No, no, no. No.

200
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:12,325
Jim, it's okay.
It's okay.

201
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:13,410
Please.

202
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,123
Boyd said...
[exhales deeply]

203
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:21,292
Boyd said you went
through a tree?

204
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:23,836
They're called Farway trees.

205
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,213
There's a bunch of them
in the forest,

206
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:26,297
but this one has bottles on it.

207
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,591
The lighthouse.

208
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,760
Was it the same lighthouse
Miranda was looking for?

209
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,845
I mean, it has to be.

210
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:35,264
Can you get back there
without the tree?

211
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,766
I don't know.
I don't... I don't know.

212
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,768
Okay. Then we need to
go to the tree.

213
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,353
All right. So, hold on.

214
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:42,813
She just got back,
and you want to do what?

215
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,899
I'm not saying go through
it again, but I need to see it.

216
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,651
I've been there, okay?

217
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:49,237
It was the first place I looked
when she didn't come back.

218
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:50,863
There is...
there is nothing to see.

219
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:54,408
Oh. You mean besides
the magic tree.

220
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,035
Uh...

221
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:58,621
Okay. The bottles.
What about the bottles?

222
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,331
Was there anything special
about them?

223
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:02,166
I took a few of 'em down.

224
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,086
There were slips of paper inside
with numbers written on them.

225
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,089
Oh, my God. And you don't
think that's important?

226
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,049
I think this place
does a pretty great job

227
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,385
on messing with our heads.

228
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:14,971
Wait. No. This is different.

229
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,682
It has to be.

230
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:21,019
Look. I get that this place is
one giant mindfuck, but...

231
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,814
[clears throat]
Pardon my French.

232
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:27,233
But she went home, okay?

233
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,485
That's not a trick.
It's not a dream!

234
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:31,988
That's real, and there is
a whole town full of people

235
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,282
who are gonna be banging down
your door demanding answers

236
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:36,951
whether you have them or not.
Take me to the tree.

237
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:39,495
Let's see if we can find some.

238
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,706
I told Boyd that I was gonna
go to that town meeting.

239
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:43,082
Oh, fuck the town meeting!
Sorry.

240
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,168
Uh, okay. Look.

241
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,379
Town meeting isn't gonna
solve anything,

242
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,172
but going to the tree,

243
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,883
at least it's a start.

244
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:56,721
[grunting]

245
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:59,932
We had to leave some of the food
back at the settlement.

246
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:04,395
We, uh, we'll probably need
to send another team out

247
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,188
before the next snowfall.

248
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,858
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

249
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:11,861
Boyd, there is
something out there,

250
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:14,447
something different.

251
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:17,825
We heard it both times now,

252
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:21,662
walking around
outside the cabins at night.

253
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,956
Okay.

254
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,126
If walking around is
all it's doing,

255
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:30,963
then, uh, we got
bigger things to worry about.

256
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,591
[scoffs]

257
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:36,093
[sighs]

258
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:39,348
[Randall grunting]

259
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,269
What they did to Randall...

260
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,231
Why'd they leave him alive?
Why not just kill him?

261
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,489
[Boyd] I think they
want us to look at him.

262
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,617
When the sun's up,

263
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:03,579
they want us to remember
what's coming at night.

264
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,831
Part of the thing that
keeps people sane here

265
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:09,377
is we get to pretend
during the daytime,

266
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,963
pretend that we're safe.

267
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:18,427
With Randall walking around,

268
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,138
then we don't get
to pretend anymore.

269
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:27,686
I removed the bullet,
stabilized her.

270
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,063
One minute, she was fine,

271
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:30,564
and then all of a sudden,
she wasn't.

272
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,526
Jesus.

273
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:34,735
- [inhales sharply]
- Sorry.

274
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:37,571
[groans] yeah.

275
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:39,740
Okay.

276
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:41,909
God. It's a miracle
there are no fractures.

277
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,663
- Mari.
- Probably have ligament damage.

278
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:48,082
This should be elevated. I'm
gonna get you another pillow.

279
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,460
Mari, just stop
for a second, please.

280
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,046
Look, last night wasn't easy,

281
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,506
and it wasn't your fault, okay?

282
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:58,801
Yeah, well...
tell that to Nicky.

283
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,261
I'm telling you.

284
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:04,056
Look. I know what
it's like. I just... [sighs]

285
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,808
I don't...
I don't want you to...

286
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:06,852
What?

287
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,105
If you think
I'm gonna start spiraling

288
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:13,023
and stealing morphine again...

289
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:15,402
- I didn't... I didn't say that.
- Well, you didn't have to.

290
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:20,115
- [groans]
- Hey. Come here.

291
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,617
Come here.

292
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,042
Hey, you are
the patient right now.

293
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,919
Can you please just
stop worrying about me

294
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,589
and let me worry about you?

295
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,469
Can we worry about each other?

296
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,761
[chuckles]

297
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:47,183
[Randall groaning in pain]

298
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,018
I gotta go.

299
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,021
- Wait.
- Just get some rest, yeah?

300
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:53,857
- [door opens]
- [sighs]

301
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:57,735
[sighs]

302
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:02,324
[Randall groaning in pain]

303
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,367
- No. Boyd...
- I just wanna help.

304
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,453
I understand that.
Boyd, you being here

305
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,246
is just gonna make things worse.

306
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:12,416
[grunting]

307
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,501
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:15,920
No. You're right.

309
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,339
Look, people need you out there.

310
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,467
They're gonna need you at
the meeting later... both of you.

311
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:22,760
There's only so much
people can take,

312
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,095
and now,
with Tabitha being back,

313
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,474
- the fact that she went home...
- [grunting]

314
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:31,352
- I gotta...
- Yeah.

315
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:33,604
[groaning]

316
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:36,524
Hey, Randall. It's okay.

317
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,567
Squeeze my hand.
I'm going to take a look.

318
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,277
- All right.
- Yeah.

319
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,072
[Marielle] Yeah.
You're okay.

320
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:49,287
This is where he stays...

321
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,165
...most of the time.

322
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,211
Oh.

323
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:11,809
Uh, it... it's, uh...
[chuckles]

324
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,853
It's a little different from
his room at home. [chuckles]

325
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,365
[exhales deeply]

326
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:30,828
For the first few years,

327
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,705
every time I'd turn a corner,

328
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:36,750
there'd be
this little spark of hope

329
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:39,878
that maybe, just maybe,

330
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,464
I'd see all of them there...

331
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:48,387
Miranda, Eloise, Victor.

332
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:52,225
[stammers] And they...
they'd smile and laugh.

333
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:58,147
We'd all cry together about what
a terrible mistake it all was.

334
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,984
[chuckles] Then...

335
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:07,698
That was the hardest part...

336
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:10,201
that little bit of hope.
[sighs]

337
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,832
That was the part
I-I couldn't bear.

338
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,966
As the years went by,

339
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:30,596
it became easier
to tell myself they were dead.

340
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:32,514
They were gone.

341
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:36,269
So, that's what I did.

342
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,706
All that time,
my little boy was here, alone.

343
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,922
What kind of man gives up
on his family?

344
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:07,550
No wonder he doesn't wanna
talk to me.

345
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:17,102
Just give him a little time.

346
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:19,728
He'll come 'round.

347
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,438
[exhales deeply]

348
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,856
Sorry to interrupt,

349
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:25,901
but, uh, we're all
heading to the meeting.

350
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:27,319
I'll be right there.

351
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,114
Meeting?

352
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:34,576
People have a lot of questions
about what happened,

353
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:35,452
about Tabitha.

354
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,705
Sure.

355
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,749
It was kind of a big deal
that she got out of here.

356
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,793
[indistinct conversations]

357
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,712
[Dale] Come on.

358
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,839
Come on!

359
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,007
Okay, everybody,
just take a seat.

360
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:52,052
- Hey, come on in.
- [Donna] Sit down here. Come on.

361
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,303
[door closes]

362
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:54,973
[Boyd] Everybody grab...
grab a seat.

363
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,644
All right, everybody.
Okay. All right.

364
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,396
All right. Look.

365
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:05,941
I understand that everybody
wants answers, right?

366
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,401
- [all chattering]
- So do I, all right?

367
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,986
But the truth is,

368
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:12,740
there's no easy explanations
to any of this, okay?

369
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,575
- There's nothing that...
- Where the hell is Tabitha?

370
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:18,203
[all] Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,580
She's coming, all right?

372
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,623
Just try to remember,
she's been through a lot.

373
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:24,168
All due respect, Boyd, but we've
all been through a lot.

374
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:25,794
- [woman] That's right.
- [all murmuring]

375
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,880
- I understand that.
- [Dale] Are... are you sure?

376
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:31,300
'Cause I feel like if you had
any clue about anything,

377
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:32,301
she'd be the one
talking instead of you.

378
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:34,094
[all] Yeah.

379
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,596
Look. Everybody
calm the fuck down.

380
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,931
Hey, why were you
in the ambulance?

381
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:41,268
Well, uh, we were
in an accident.

382
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,354
I was taking Tabitha
to a park near my...

383
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,606
Tabitha's here.

384
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:46,816
[chattering]

385
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:52,279
What do I say?

386
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,032
Just tell 'em the truth.

387
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:00,370
[chattering]

388
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:01,288
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

389
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:02,290
Yeah.

390
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:08,670
Did you really
go through a tree?

391
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:10,255
Hey, let's let her talk.

392
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:14,343
It's okay. Um, uh, I did. Yes.

393
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,762
Um...

394
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:20,641
I-I imagine some
of you already know this,

395
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:23,769
but, um, there are
some trees in the forest

396
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,855
that aren't like
the other trees.

397
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:32,110
Hey. Town meeting's
already started.

398
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,696
Yeah. I just gotta
grab something.

399
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:38,868
[door closes]

400
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:00,557
[knock on door]

401
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,518
Hello?

402
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:23,537
<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

403
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:26,373
[Fatima]
<i>'Cause I wanted you to see</i>

404
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:30,002
that if you climb high enough,

405
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:32,547
even a nightmare can
look like a dream.

406
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:03,286
Hello?

407
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,081
- [sighs] Hey, Elgin.
- [grunts]

408
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,751
[gasps] Oh, my...
What the fuck?

409
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:12,878
I'm so sorry. I...
[stammers] I thought you...

410
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,963
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

411
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,506
Are you okay?

412
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:20,678
No. Not really. I...

413
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:25,099
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, no. Wait.

414
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:28,894
I could use some company,

415
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:32,147
if you're not, uh,
you know, busy.

416
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:33,732
Sure.

417
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:38,070
Victor?
What are you doing?

418
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,738
It's cold out here.

419
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:42,407
I never drew pictures of him.

420
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,743
What?

421
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:46,579
When I was alone here,
I never...

422
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,999
I always drew pictures
of things that I saw,

423
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,877
because I knew
the pictures would remember,

424
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:57,506
but I never...
I never drew pictures

425
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:58,800
of what came before.

426
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:06,640
And now I told myself
that was a dream and that...

427
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,227
that he was...

428
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,190
Victor...

429
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,901
None of that matters.

430
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,277
- He's here.
- [murmurs]

431
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,613
Somehow, your father is here,

432
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:23,198
and he's waiting
for you back in town.

433
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,492
No. No. He's waiting
for a little boy

434
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:27,328
that drove away a long time ago.

435
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:33,793
What's he gonna think...

436
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,881
...when he sees... me?
[sighs]

437
00:23:43,094 --> 00:23:44,095
I don't know.

438
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,310
I know I'm supposed to
tell you that it'll be okay,

439
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:56,189
and he'll love you
no matter what.

440
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,942
But I don't know if that's true.

441
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:02,155
You're really bad at this.

442
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:04,907
Sorry.

443
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:13,915
I don't know you that well,

444
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,793
but you seem like
a really good person,

445
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:19,464
and that's something
to be proud of here.

446
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:24,677
I would give anything to feel
like a good person again.

447
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,681
Maybe...

448
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:34,228
Maybe you're not the only one
who's afraid.

449
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:39,775
Maybe he's afraid
of not being the dad

450
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:41,444
that little boy remembers.

451
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:08,887
So, you see this woman
in the kimono

452
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:10,347
even when you're awake?

453
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:11,849
Now, I do. Yeah.

454
00:25:13,768 --> 00:25:16,394
Well, is she trying to hurt you?

455
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:18,063
I thought she was at first,

456
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:20,315
but when I saw her last night,

457
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:21,484
she asked me for my help.

458
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,695
With what?

459
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:27,405
I don't know.

460
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,533
If my grandma was here,
she'd probably tell me

461
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,952
it was an angel or somethin'.

462
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:34,704
"Remember now, there's a reason
why angels say 'Fear not'

463
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:36,748
when they saw someone.

464
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:38,458
Even Gabriel was terrifying."

465
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,503
[chuckles] Wow.

466
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,088
Look at you,
Mr. Bible Study.

467
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:44,924
- [chuckles]
- [scoffs]

468
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,847
You wanna know
the fucked up part?

469
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:55,809
I would take the creepy
kimono woman in a heartbeat

470
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,853
over the shit
I hear in my head now.

471
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:59,980
[laughs]

472
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:01,065
Like what?

473
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,318
Mostly just screaming.

474
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:08,113
But I don't...

475
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:09,574
[sighs] I don't just hear it.
It's like...

476
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:13,077
It's like I can feel it, too.

477
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,289
This is the only thing
that makes it quiet.

478
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,338
You talk to your folks about it?

479
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,799
What are they gonna do?
[exhales deeply]

480
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,343
[coughs]

481
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,554
They're in the diner
right now with everyone else,

482
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:34,181
trying to figure out what
it means that my mom got out.

483
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:35,473
[scoffs]

484
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,351
What do you think it means?

485
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:40,938
Honestly, I don't think
it means anything.

486
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:46,235
I think
this whole place exists...

487
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:51,990
I think it's just here
to make us suffer.

488
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:54,868
Maybe that's why it let her out.

489
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,037
What do you mean?

490
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,207
Best way to make us suffer
is to give us hope.

491
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,296
I don't think
it's ever gonna let us go.

492
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:13,261
You're so depressing
when you're stoned.

493
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:16,097
[coughs and laughs]

494
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,474
Sorry.

495
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:20,435
[laughter]

496
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:22,020
[Tabitha] And then
the next thing I knew,

497
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:24,481
um, the ambulance had stopped.

498
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:27,150
The driver said that there was a
tree in the middle of the road,

499
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,945
and you all know
how things go from there.

500
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:30,988
Come on in.

501
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:33,573
- [door closes]
- When you were out there...

502
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:36,117
did you contact anyone?

503
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:38,286
Did you let the police,
anyone know about this place?

504
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:41,248
- [townspeople] Yes.
- Uh, I-I really wanted to.

505
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,375
- Oh. Are you fucking kidding me?
- [all murmuring]

506
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:45,710
- Watch your mouth.
- [woman 1] Come on.

507
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:49,339
- [woman 2] That could be it.
- Um, you don't understand.

508
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,216
They... they wouldn't
have believed me.

509
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,926
Tabitha, you don't know that.

510
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:56,263
Look. [grunts] All due respect,
when she told me,

511
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:58,431
I thought she was
out of her mind.

512
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:02,060
But you believed her.
Eventually, you believed her.

513
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:05,438
To be fair, my circumstances

514
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:08,358
are a little different
than the average person.

515
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,985
Look.
I-I was in the ambulance

516
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:11,695
when she was begging us
to turn around,

517
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:13,405
and we thought
she was hysterical.

518
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:14,990
What is she even doing here?

519
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,367
- She killed someone last night.
- [all] Yeah.

520
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:19,744
- All right. Oh, hey, hey!
- Come on!

521
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:20,870
Hey! Look.
That was an accident.

522
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,372
- [woman] Accident?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

523
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,833
Everything's an accident
unless it's somebody that you

524
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:27,335
and Queen Bee here don't like.

525
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:29,170
[Clara] I'm sorry to say this,
but you had an opportunity

526
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:32,382
that none of us have ever had
before, and you blew it.

527
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:33,591
- [woman 1] Yeah.
- [woman 2] Wow.

528
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,635
- Excuse me.
- We're just waiting here.

529
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:38,847
What exactly would you
have done, huh?

530
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,098
What would any of you have done?

531
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:41,141
- Hey.
- [Dale] Well, I wouldn't have

532
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,642
taken a day trip to the park.

533
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:45,437
- [woman] Yeah. Something.
- That's not what it was.

534
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:47,689
- I wasn't taking a day trip.
- [Fatima] You were out there

535
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,525
in the real world
where people can help.

536
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:52,736
How could you not take
advantage of that?

537
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:54,195
- [man] Right.
- Yeah, they may have thought

538
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:55,780
you were crazy,
but what if they didn't?

539
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,491
What if somebody believed you?

540
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,493
Well, someone believed me,
and look where he is!

541
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:02,412
He's sitting right here with us!

542
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:05,206
- Tabitha.
- Look. I'm sure everyone

543
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,083
could have done
a better job than what I did,

544
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:09,795
and I'm so sorry you didn't
have that opportunity.

545
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:13,548
I'm sorry I don't have
your answers.

546
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,176
I'm... I'm sorry.

547
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,094
I... I can't do this.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

548
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,263
- [woman] Tabitha, please.
- [Dale] Oh, come on!

549
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:21,264
Not now.
That's enough.

550
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:23,308
- I can't.
- Oh, my God.

551
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,353
Hey, listen. Listen.

552
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,104
The most important part
of all of this...

553
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:29,022
- [door closes]
- ...the thing that we cannot

554
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:32,776
lose sight of is
Tabitha got out.

555
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,944
For all the good
it seems to have done.

556
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,696
No, no, but it's...
it's not about the fact

557
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,406
that she is back here.

558
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:40,742
It's that someone got home.

559
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:43,244
It's not just hoping
and wishing anymore.

560
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:46,581
We have concrete proof now.
It's possible.

561
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:48,500
Great. Where's the tree?

562
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:49,834
- What?
- [woman] Really.

563
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,379
Where... is... the... tree?

564
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,214
[townspeople] Yeah!

565
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:57,842
Everybody just calm down.
Slow down for a second.

566
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,219
We gotta think about this, okay?

567
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,137
Well, what is there
to think about?

568
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:03,890
Tabitha went through the tree
and got home, right?

569
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:06,142
Why aren't we all lining up
to do the same?

570
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:07,685
Because it's not
that simple, okay?

571
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,604
We can't just run out there
into the forest

572
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:11,189
and hop into the first tree
that we see!

573
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,524
Why not?

574
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:15,151
Wha... Excuse me?

575
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:17,278
[Fatima] I just...
I... I'm sorry, Boyd.

576
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,156
I don't wanna be here a second
longer than I have to be.

577
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:22,742
Even... even if there is
the slightest chance

578
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:26,162
that this tree can get us home,
what are we waiting for?

579
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,872
- Okay. Everybody just...
- [Ellis] No, no, no.

580
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:29,707
Dad, Dad, she's right, okay?

581
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,793
We can't just sit here and talk
all day...

582
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:36,005
Okay! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
No! Listen! Hey, hey, hey!

583
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,716
You're all assuming that this
tree is some kind of magic door.

584
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,218
It's not.

585
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:41,928
I went through one
of those trees,

586
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:43,888
and you know where I ended up?

587
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:47,142
In a chimney underground.

588
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,184
Damn near killed myself.

589
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:49,644
- Look.
- You don't...

590
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:52,313
It wasn't even the tree
that got her out of here.

591
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:54,941
She said it was the lighthouse.

592
00:30:54,942 --> 00:30:56,651
Great. Let's just
get to the lighthouse,

593
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:58,111
and then we'll go home.

594
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:00,405
- Listen to me, okay?
- No, you fucking listen!

595
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:02,907
- Dale, come on!
- No, no, no! I've had it!

596
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:05,785
I've had it!
Had it with your... plans.

597
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:07,997
I've had it
with your fucking rules!

598
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,835
I wanna go home!

599
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:17,213
[all murmuring]

600
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:20,634
[indistinct conversations]

601
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:27,515
Why didn't you go
to the meeting?

602
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:29,767
[liquid pours, clatter]

603
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,769
One thing you'll learn
when you're older,

604
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,814
any meeting with more than three
people is basically pointless.

605
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:36,483
[door opens]

606
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:38,193
- [Tabitha] Jade?
- That was quick.

607
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:39,695
[door closes]

608
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:43,031
[Jade] How'd it go?

609
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:44,491
[Jim] Uh, uh...

610
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:45,783
Huh?

611
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:46,910
Not great.

612
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:47,827
See?

613
00:31:47,828 --> 00:31:49,287
We're going to the tree.

614
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:51,581
- Finally.
- Wait. What?

615
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:54,375
I have nothing to tell them,
Jim. They're right.

616
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,377
I went out. I went out,
and I came back.

617
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:58,546
And I came back with nothing.

618
00:31:58,547 --> 00:32:00,381
I owe it to them.

619
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:02,425
[scoffs] You <i>owe?</i>

620
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:03,760
- Yes.
- Tabitha, you just got back,

621
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,303
and now you wanna
go back out there?

622
00:32:05,304 --> 00:32:06,804
It's not like she's
gonna go in the tree.

623
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:08,223
- Exactly.
- Would you just stay outta this?

624
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:11,226
- I wanna go, too.
- No! Nobody is going to a tree.

625
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:14,479
Jim!

626
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,522
- I need to speak with you...
- Yeah.

627
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:17,649
...for a minute, please.

628
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,567
[sighs]

629
00:32:19,568 --> 00:32:22,028
You need to think
about what you're doing.

630
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:24,072
- I am.
- [scoffs]

631
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:27,158
We thought you were dead.

632
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,869
Your children thought
you were dead.

633
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,621
You think I give a shit
about what you owe

634
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:33,081
to these people in a diner?

635
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,874
You owe it to your kids
to be here now.

636
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,502
I'm just gonna show him
where the tree is.

637
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:41,172
That's all.
I'm not gonna go in.

638
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:43,050
I'll be back. I promise.

639
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:49,597
Fine, but Ethan...
he stays here with me.

640
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:53,059
Do you know he ran off looking
for you when you were gone?

641
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,436
Do you really wanna
take him out there

642
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:57,648
and show him where the...
the magic tree is?

643
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:01,943
- Okay.
- Yeah.

644
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:03,779
- Okay.
- Okay.

645
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:10,243
Ethan, you're gonna stay here
with your father, okay?

646
00:33:10,244 --> 00:33:14,038
- But I wanna help.
- You're helping by staying here.

647
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,083
I'll be back soon. Let's go.

648
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:19,587
I'll get my coat.

649
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:23,507
[door opens]

650
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,217
Dad.

651
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:27,427
[indistinct conversations]

652
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:28,469
Hey!

653
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,430
Stop, Dad!

654
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:33,725
Come on. Hey! Hey!

655
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:34,767
What the fuck is wrong with you?

656
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:36,060
- What?
- We are sitting

657
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,437
on a powder keg in there,

658
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,147
and you and Fatima
are lighting matches.

659
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:40,356
- She's upset.
- Oh, yeah?

660
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:42,400
Well, guess what?
We're all fucking upset.

661
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:45,528
What we need to do
is calm people down.

662
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:47,488
Okay, or maybe what we need is
for someone around here

663
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:49,407
to start doing something
instead of sitting around

664
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:51,451
worrying about what
could go wrong.

665
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:52,702
Is that what I'm doing?
I'm just...

666
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:54,454
I'm just sitting around.
Is that it, huh?

667
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,456
Maybe what we need is
to start taking chances.

668
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:58,292
Oh, you wanna take
some chances. Okay.

669
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,336
Who... who... who you
wanna take a chance on?

670
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:03,921
Whose life are you willing
to take a chance to gamble on?

671
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:05,465
You know that's not
what I'm saying.

672
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:08,509
No, no! Tell me,
'cause I wanna know!

673
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,927
Who we gonna march
out there next?

674
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,804
Huh? Huh?

675
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:14,474
You wanna do something, right?
So tell me! Who's next?

676
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:17,686
Who's your pick?!

677
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:20,397
Exactly.

678
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:26,194
What happened in there...
is a dangerous thing.

679
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:27,696
It's a dangerous...

680
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:43,795
I never realized
all this stuff was down here.

681
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,297
Yeah. Uh,
this is where they store

682
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,175
the surplus of weird.

683
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:53,262
Oh. Uh, I couldn't
sleep one night,

684
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:54,973
and, uh, I found this.

685
00:34:58,394 --> 00:35:00,603
Oh, my God.

686
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:04,273
Oh. This is, like...

687
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:06,359
It's, like,
the vintage motherlode.

688
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,195
Oh, no. No. It's not
just vintage.

689
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:10,446
This shit is, uh...

690
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:11,865
This is '80s vintage.

691
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:17,954
Can you imagine people
running through the woods

692
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:20,748
in, like, fluorescent spandex?

693
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:23,167
With their big-ass hair
getting caught in the branches?

694
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:24,211
[laughs]

695
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:27,756
Oh. Hold on.

696
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:32,635

I went down there the day you...

876
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:35,756
I was hoping to find
something to help Julie.

877
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:37,592
Instead, I saw this.

878
00:46:43,014 --> 00:46:45,516
Turns out it wasn't a symbol.
It was a hole in the ceiling,

879
00:46:45,517 --> 00:46:48,895
and these slashes were roots.

880
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,564
Huh.

881
00:46:52,565 --> 00:46:59,029

laid out on slabs of stone,

over and over again.

Anghkooey.

When I tell you
I felt fear in that moment

885
00:47:08,665 --> 00:47:10,750
like I've never felt
in my life...

886
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:15,921
But there was also this...
this glimpse

887
00:47:15,922 --> 00:47:19,174

was there but I couldn't...

888

even with all
the fucking horror,

889
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:24,096
it was like, for the first time,

890
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:28,016
I felt like there were threads

891
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:30,769
that were finally
starting to connect.

892
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,856

These numbers in these bottles,

898
00:47:46,202 --> 00:47:49,246
they might seem like this tree.

899
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,499
There is no denying
what this tree did,

900
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,251

someone took the time

901
