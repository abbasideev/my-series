00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,450
they're made of energy.

181
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,953
And that energy...

182
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,205
Maybe here, that energy...
I don't know,

183
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:05,751
maybe it lingers.

184
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,794
All right, look, you... you said
it was one of those...

185
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:10,297
those creepy kids that led you
to the root cellar, right?

186
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,507
- Yeah, a little girl.
- [Jade] Okay.

187
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,092
Whatever it was
Miranda showed you,

188
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:16,928
those kids wanted you to see.

189
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,308
Where were you when you
saw the little girl?

190
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,980
Out by Victor's truck.

191
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,534
Elgin.

192
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,163
Mind if we talk
to you for a minute?

193
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:46,166
Yeah. Okay.

194
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,877
We'll go to my room.

195
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:53,299
- I'll take that.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,055
[Boyd] Just in there.

197
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:07,897
[Boyd clears throat]

198
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,485
Go on. Have a seat.

199
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,238
Have a seat.

200
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,205
Can you watch the door for me?

201
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:32,212
I mean, it looks like you, uh,

202
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,340
packed supplies
for a couple days.

203
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,343
Where were you going?

204
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,138
I was just...

205
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:45,434
[Boyd] Yeah.

206
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,144
I'm gonna ask you something,

207
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:50,272
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

208
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:52,066
Do you know where Fatima is?

209
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,612
- Elgin?
- Answer the question.

210
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,410
She told me not
to say anything. I just...

211
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:07,290
I know how much
you all care about her.

212
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:11,418
When you told me
about your mom...

213
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,296
I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

214
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:18,633
I wanted to help.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

215
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,052
But you have to understand,

216
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,097
what's happening is
a good thing.

217
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,603
Elgin, you said she told you
not to say anything. Who is she?

218
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:33,690
I know it sounds crazy,
but I think she's an angel.

219
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:36,485
- Elgin, there's...
- [Elgin] She's here to help us!

220
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:38,945
Something is happening here
that's beyond

221
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:43,366
our ability to understand,
like in the Bible.

222
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,911
People never really
understood then.

223
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,455
But they had faith,

224
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:50,207
even when it was hard,

225
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,460
especially when it's hard.

226
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:57,088
Fatima's baby is going
to save all of us.

227
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,967
Hey, Elgin, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

228
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,597
- There is no baby.
- That's not true.

229
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:08,642
Kristi and Marielle did
an ultrasound in the clinic.

230
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,352
And when they
pulled up the image,

231
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:12,312
there was nothing there.

232
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:17,025
Whatever's growing
inside her is not a child.

233
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:19,653
The things it's done to her,
the things it's made her do...

234
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:22,697
You don't understand.
She explained all that to me.

235
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:24,699
Wait. The angel?

236
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,077
Yes.

237
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,081
[Sara] Elgin.

238
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:37,380
The day we met, I...
told you I killed my brother.

239
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:42,467
Do you know why that happened?

240
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,387
There were voices here
that told me

241
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:48,683
if I killed a little boy,
we would all get to go home.

242
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,644
This place...

243
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,354
it doesn't give.

244
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,731
It takes.

245
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,484
And what it's doing to you...

246
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,279
But do you see how
it's different?

247
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:04,364
No one is dying here.

248
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,366
Fatima is gonna be fine.

249
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,703
You don't fucking know that,
okay? You don't know that!

250
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:14,082
Once the baby is born,
we all get to go home.

251
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,711
Elgin, even if she's pregnant,

252
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:19,337
that's still months away.

253
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,007
No. It's grown.

254
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,718
You should see Fatima's belly.

255
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,136
- Okay. Where the fuck is she?
- No, no, no! Hey!

256
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,762
- Where the fuck is she?
- I can't!

257
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,264
- Kenny!
- [all shouting at once]

258
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:30,765
- Kenny, Kenny!
- I'll fucking kill you!

259
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,434
- Where is she?
- I can't! I can't!

260
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,811
[Boyd] All right! All right!
Everybody out!

261
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:36,479
- Hey! Just relax!
- Out! Out! Outside!

262
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,814
[Boyd] Everybody, now!
Let's go!

263
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,233
No. He knows where
she is, all right?

264
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,694
- I can't just let him sit there!
- I know. I know. Just breathe.

265
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,237
No. I don't need
to fucking breathe!

266
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:47,115
- What I need is to find my wife!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

267
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:49,242
We're gonna find out
everything that he knows.

268
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,202
I just need you to calm down.

269
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:53,121
What he said about the baby,

270
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:56,583
about how big Fatima's gotten,
do you think it's true?

271
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,085
I don't know, Donna.

272
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:00,546
[Sara]
He's not gonna tell you!

273
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,633
I know what it's like to have
this place in your head.

274
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:07,552
If he really believes what he's
saying is gonna save everyone,

275
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:10,097
he's not gonna tell you
where she is.

276
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:16,102
Where do you keep your tools?

277
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:17,605
- Boyd.
- Where?

278
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:22,150
The shed.
They're in the shed.

279
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:23,234
Whoa. Boyd.

280
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:25,779
You stay by the door.

281
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,657
He doesn't come out.

282
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:33,203
No one...
goes back in that room.

283
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:36,123
[dramatic music playing]

284
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:43,214
Victor.

285
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,802
Uh, how are things
going with, uh, Jasper?

286
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:52,390
Did he say anything
interesting so far?

287
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,394
It's just a doll.
You were right.

288
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,523
Dolls don't talk.

289
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:03,150
Oh.

290
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,905
Look. I... [sighs]

291
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:12,158
I-I-I just wanted to say,

292
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,162
I'm sorry I haven't
been more help.

293
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:20,625
All this...
it's been a lot for me.

294
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,461
But that's no excuse.

295
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,383
- From now on...
- I have to show you something.

296
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,594
Okay.

297
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,888
It's gonna make you angry.

298
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,807
It's... it's gonna
make you hate me.

299
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,308
What?

300
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,728
But I have to show you.

301
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,189
And then we'll be done.

302
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:44,524
Uh, done with what?

303
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:45,942
It's this way.

304
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,737
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,590
- You really gonna do this?
- [sighs]

306
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,510
I don't got time for you today.

307
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,387
What comes first?

308
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:15,847
You gonna use the saw
or the hammer?

309
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,932
Oh, you know what you should do?

310
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,893
You should go old school.

311
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:23,521
Get yourself some pliers and rip
his fingernails right off.

312
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,482
Well, if that's what it takes.

313
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,400
You really don't see
the irony, do you?

314
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,527
What the fuck are you
talking about?

315
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,863
Oh, I don't know.
When Fatima killed Tillie,

316
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,698
you didn't even blink.

317
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,700
I mean, you did everything
you could to protect her.

318
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,993
You took her out to the shed.

319
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:39,871
You lied to the people
you claim to care about.

320
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,956
Hell, Kenny's
in there right now.

321
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,541
He still doesn't
know what she did.

322
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,628
What happened wasn't her fault.

323
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,007
Okay, and tell me how that's
any different with Elgin.

324
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,885
I mean, this place
got inside his head,

325
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,262
made him think
he was doing something good.

326
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:59,224
Convinced him he was
actually protecting Fatima.

327
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,770
And now, you're out here getting
ready to go medieval on him.

328
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:05,563
Bit of a double standard,
don't you think?

329
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,482
It's different.

330
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,317
There's nothing
I could do about Tillie.

331
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:11,694
Oh, bullshit. Tell yourself
anything you want, Boyd.

332
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:14,239
I mean, you...
you walk around here

333
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,491
like you're some
big knight in shining armor,

334
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:19,494
Mr. Noble Sheriff.

335
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,747
Push comes to shove, you're no
different than anyone else.

336
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:25,291
You protect what's yours,
and you fuck anyone

337
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,836
who gets in your way. You were
supposed to be better than this.

338
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,046
Hey, you were
supposed to be here!

339
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,048
You were...

340
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,468
You and I were supposed
to figure this out together!

341
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,595
You were the one who went
in the fucking street

342
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,055
and got his throat slit!

343
00:18:39,056 --> 00:18:40,933
So, don't you come in here
and judge...

344
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:44,727
You don't get to judge me.

345
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,813
I'm doing the best I can.

346
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:49,316
You know there's no coming
back from this, right?

347
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:54,488
You said that you weren't gonna
let this place break you.

348
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:58,700
But if you do this,

349
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,702
this place has won.

350
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:06,583
And if I don't... uh...

351
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:09,794
my daughter-in-law dies.

352
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:12,630
Well, that's why they call it
a rock and a hard place,

353
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,508
not a rock and a soft,
comfy pillow.

354
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:20,555
You need to decide right now
who you are,

355
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:25,019
because that's who you're
gonna be from now on.

356
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:49,000
Someone open this door!

357
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,002
Please! [sobbing]

358
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:54,048
[panting]

359
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:58,427
[clattering]

360
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:01,388
[continues panting]

361
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:15,652
- [screams]
- [shatters]

362
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,614
[panting]

363
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,127
[ominous music playing]

364
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:47,142
[inhales sharply, groans]

365
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:49,937
[panting]

366
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,980
What are we doing here?

367
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,023
I thought maybe
there was a reason

368
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,734
they came out to you here.

369
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,194
Look. The only thing
tying together

370
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:00,989
all the crazy
that we've seen, right...

371
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,908
me, you, Miranda... the...
the one point of overlap

372
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,077
in all our Venn diagrams
of crazy...

373
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,162
Is the children.

374
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,206
Wait.
You've seen them too?

375
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:11,791
In the cavern.

376
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,085
They were laying on these...
these slabs of rock,

377
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,753
saying that word,
that "Anghkooey."

378
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,754
- Yeah.
- "Anghkooey,"

379
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,756
over and over again.

380
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,050
And I looked up.

381
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,804
There was this hole
in the ceiling.

382
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:29,726
And there was this mass
of... of... of roots,

383
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,145
this tangle forming
that fucking symbol.

384
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:33,813
The roots of the tree.

385
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,107
What'd you say?

386
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,234
The Boy in White...
Victor heard him.

387
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:41,612
He said when the kids
were on the stones,

388
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:45,783
they poured their hopes into
the roots that made the symbol,

389
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,703
and then those roots
became the tree.

390
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:50,830
Is it the bottle tree?

391
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,833
Uh, yeah, I think so.

392
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:59,005
Okay. So the, uh,
creepy kids

393
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,549
made a magic tree.

394
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,595
And the symbol that has been

395
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:08,182
plaguing me this whole time...
[chuckles]

396
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,852
[Jade laughing]

397
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:18,650
You could have just
fucking told me!

398
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:21,986
- You didn't have to...
- Jade. Jade.

399
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,780
No, no! I am sick...

400
00:22:23,781 --> 00:22:25,948
I am sick and tired
of getting dicked around!

401
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:29,202
If you really want our help,

402
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:31,913
if there is something
you need us to understand,

403
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:34,248
you're gonna have
to do a little better,

404
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:36,542
because we are not getting it!

405
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:39,671
You hear me? Message is
not fucking received!

406
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:45,676
So, we're gonna sit here,
and we're gonna wait.

407
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:47,845
And when you decide

408
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,556
that you have
something more to say

409
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:54,560
than fucking "Anghkooey,"

410
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:55,854
you know where to find us!

411
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:04,695
You feel better now?

412
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:06,740
No. Not really.

413
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:11,327

[groans]

422
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,234
You're not giving yourself
time to heal.

423
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,903
Well, Fatima's still out there.
I can't just sit here.

424
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,239
I'm gonna get some fresh gauze.

425
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:51,617
You were really quiet
last night,

426
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:52,869
after they brought Julie in.

427
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,328
I just felt bad.

428
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,248
- I mean, she's...
- [clattering]

429
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:58,792
Uh, Randall?

430
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,212
Hey, what happened
to your bandage?

431
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:05,089
It fell off.

432
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,258
Uh, where's the stuff from
the ambulance, the new stuff?

433
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,260
- It's in the cabinets.
- No, not the medicine.

434
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,679
The equipment.
Where did you put the equipment?

435
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,264
There's a supply closet
downstairs. We...

436
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:16,017
- Great.
- [Marielle] Randall.

it fucking stop!

No one comes upstairs.

467
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:34,429
- Dad, just...
- Nobody comes upstairs.

468
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:39,309
- You make sure of that, okay?
- Yeah.

469
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:44,272
What happens next...

470
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:47,191
that's on me.

Boyd.

473
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:58,078
Go downstairs now, Kenny.

474
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:01,872
We should talk to him again.

475
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:04,041
Look. He's a good kid,

476
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,168
and there's gotta be a way
to make him understand this.

477
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:08,337
Fatima's out there.

478
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:10,090
She may be running out of time.

479
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:13,969
Go downstairs.

480
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:17,806
Please?

I can't tell you.

484

I wish I could, but...
but I can't.

485
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,259
I understand.

00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,304
You need to do what
you need to do.

00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:00,431

what I need to do.

That's how
she sends me messages.

to talk to you.

496
00:27:58,115 --> 00:27:59,490
Here.

Okay.

498
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,456
Victor, where are we going?

499
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:09,417
We're here.

00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:11,044
We're here?

501
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,559
What is that?

502
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,145
I tried to make it pretty.

503
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,107
The way she would have liked it.

00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:34,568
Hmm? Wait.

505
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:37,529
This is where I buried Mom.

506
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:41,408
I thought you'd want to see.

507
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:49,082
Oh, God.

00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,280
Is that Eloise?

514
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,950
I think so.

515
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,955
All I found were pieces.

[whimpering]

517
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:35,170
She was so small.

518
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,298
There wasn't much left.

519
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,510
[breathing unsteadily]

520
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:45,054
It was my fault.

521
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:47,097
What?

522
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:49,600
I thought Jasper
told Christopher the secrets.

523
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,644
It wasn't Jasper.
It was the Boy in White.

524
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:54,271
I was wrong.
He told Christopher about...

525
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:56,983
about the children and the tree.

526
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:02,571
[crying] But I was the one
that told Mom.

527
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:04,990
[Victor crying]

528
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:08,244
I told her that the tree would
bring her to the children.

529
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:11,288
[sniffling] I was the reason
that she left that night, Dad.

530
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:16,126
- I was the reason that she died.
- Victor, you know...

531
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:17,711
If I'd just not said anything,

532
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:20,631
she would still be here,
and Eloise would still be here.

533
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:24,218
No. Victor,
you were just a boy. You...

534
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:25,594
I should have died
that night, too.

535
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:27,304
What?

536
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:29,390
And you should
pretend that I did.

537
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,392
You don't have to be
my dad anymore.

538
00:30:31,393 --> 00:30:32,601
No. Wait. Stop.

539
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:34,646
Goddamn it! I said stop!

540
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,649
You don't ever say that again!

541
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,151
Do you hear me?!

542
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,279
You don't ever...

543
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:46,574
I'm your dad.

544
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,577
I will never stop
being your dad.

545
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:53,163
Your mother did what she did
because she loved you.

546
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:54,373
[whimpering]

547
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,333
She was trying to protect you.

[sniffling]

549
00:30:58,169 --> 00:30:59,795
That's my job now.

550
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:02,131
Okay?

551
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:03,550
That's my job.

552
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:08,304
Okay?

553
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:11,600
[dramatic music plays]

554
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,729
[Jade] Listen. If those
kids made the tree,

555
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,565
then those messages
in the bottles, the numbers,

556
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,650
they have to matter.

557
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:23,694
How do we know the numbers
mean anything?

558
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:26,530
We don't even know who
put them there.

559
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,699
I mean, think of all the people
who have been here.

560
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,243
We could be chasing
someone's random delusion.

561
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:34,580
No! Miranda knew
those bottles were important.

562
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:37,291
Why else would she have
a replica in her backyard?

563
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,627
She's right. Like, there's
something there. There has

564
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:41,587
- to be something there.
- Of course. There has to be.

565
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:43,380
All right. Okay.
There's ten numbers, right?

566
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:46,258
- Two are backwards?
- Yes, the two and the sevens.

567
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:48,052
Great.
So that means there's 12.

568
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:49,428
And believe me, I have tried

569
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,848
every mathematical,
astronomical, astrological,

cipher I can imagine.

573

the Fibonacci sequence.

574
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:04,360
There's nothing there.
Believe me.

575
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:05,779
Aren't there
12 notes in a scale?

576
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:11,116
What'd you say?

577
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:14,244
Music.
My mom was a piano teacher.

578
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:16,872
She used to say that music
is the universal language.

579
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:19,124
I mean, there <i>are</i> 12 notes
in a scale, right?

00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,835

the flats and the sharp.

you are a fucking genius.

I love you. Uh, we need
to get to the bar.

583
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,217
You need to go to your house.

584
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:29,426
- Why?
- Victor's mother had a violin.

585
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:31,178
He hid it somewhere
in your basement.

586
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:33,138
- Why?
- Because I kept stealing it.

587
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:35,350
Just meet us at the bar.
Come on, people! Let's go!

588

- [door closes]
- How's he doing?

589
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:47,362
I gave him something
that should help him sleep.

590
00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:52,449
Well, what are we gonna
do when he wakes up?

591
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,159
I mean, he tried to...

592
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,829
He had the paddle on his head.

593
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,872
I don't know.

594
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:05,170
Look. I've...
I've tried to be respectful,

595
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:07,798
and I've tried
to give you space,

596
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,550
but I just really need you
to talk to me right now.

597
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:12,469
About what?

598
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,513
Randall just tried
to lobotomize himself,

599
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:17,809
Julie is a mess, and you're
acting like everything's fine.

600
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:23,647
Hey. Look. I don't know what
the three of you went through,

601
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:25,315
but I just need you
to tell me if you're okay.

602
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,151
- Kristi.
- No.

603
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:28,194
Look at me.

604
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,530
Look at me.

605
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,867
Are you okay?

606
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,664
No, I'm not.

607
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,712
And I don't think any of us
are gonna be.

608
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:50,257
- Okay.
- Please, can you...

609
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:51,885
can you tell me
what was in the picture?

611
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,389

That's what you wanna know, huh?

00:33:58,767 --> 00:33:59,850

You know what was
in the fucking picture?

619

I'll tell you what was
in the picture.

620
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:15,866
It was a picture of my house,

621
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:19,536
the house that I bought
with my wife when I retired,

622

623
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:25,919
when I ran
into that fucking tree.

The only thing missing

625
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:31,965
was the boat.

We're going home.

a little more time...

You took my family.

Do you understand that?

647
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:36,864
You took someone I love,

648
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,782
and you put her in danger.

what happened to you.

But we're not gonna wait.
We are not gonna talk.

651
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:48,000
You're gonna tell me
where she is,

- or I am going to hurt you.
- I can't. I can't.

And I'm not gonna stop
hurting you

until you tell me
what I need to know.

655
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,718
Tell me you understand.

656

- Tell me!
- I understand.

I can't.

- Just...

- It's your last chance.
- I can't. Boyd, I can't.

- Please, please, Boyd.
- Huh? Listen!

683
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:09,623
I'm not playing with you!

684
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:11,458
Where is she?!

Turn around
and walk out the door!

- Dani, come on.
- Don't fucking touch me!

Hey, you do not understand
what is going on here!

691
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,681
Then explain it to me.

692

- What the...
- [groaning loudly]

694
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,687
- Dad!
- Downstairs!

695
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:34,606
Let's go.

696
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:37,651
How do we know
in what order they go in?

697
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:42,698
Well... we treat it
like any composition.

698
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:47,120
We try to figure out what is
a chord and what is a melody.

699
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:51,665
2, 9, 7, 5. 2975.

700
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,127
- The 2 is backwards.
- Mm-hmm.

701
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:59,131
So, that would be a G

702
00:37:59,132 --> 00:38:01,174
instead of a B, okay,

703
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:05,762
followed by F sharp, D, E. Okay.

704
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:08,974
So, if it was a melody,
it would be something like...

705
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:10,475
<i>♪ Dah dah dah dah ♪</i>

706
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:13,061
- G, F sharp, E, D.
- Uh-huh.

707
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:15,147
