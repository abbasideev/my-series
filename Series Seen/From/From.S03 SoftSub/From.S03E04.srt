00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,833
My mother, too, but they died.

181
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,126
Just like Nathan,

182
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,205
except I didn't murder them.

183
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,252
Is this enough?

184
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,135
Yeah, that's good.

185
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,812
[grunting]

186
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,814
I don't understand what
we're doing.

187
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,107
I told you, I have to remember.

188
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,352
Remember what?

189
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,155
When I was a boy, my mother
tried to save everyone,

190
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,033
but she died.
And then everyone died,

191
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:21,954
and I can't remember how or why.

192
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,157
And I think I need to
remember soon.

193
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,125
Why?

194
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,045
Too many things are changing.

195
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,206
It's never snowed here before.

196
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,927
We have to go in the basement.

197
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,888
Up here is for daytime stories.

198
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,049
The basement's for secrets.

199
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,056
Hello? Unit 4-5.

200
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,028
How are we still
in the goddamn woods?

201
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,113
We were right outside the city
when we stopped at that tree.

202
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,990
What does the GPS say?

203
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,076
Same thing it said ten minutes
ago... data unavailable.

204
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,078
We gotta be driving in circles.
The woods aren't this deep.

205
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,996
Okay, fine.
I'll turn around.

206
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,997
No, no, no!
Please don't turn around!

207
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,833
Uh, just... just
keep going forward.

208
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,001
- Whoa. Lady, calm down.
- If you turn around,

209
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,087
you'll be driving
away from town!

210
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,839
What town?
We're looking for the highway.

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,967
I know, I know, but, uh...

212
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,260
you have to listen to me.
It's, uh...

213
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,221
It's not safe to stop out here
once it gets dark,

214
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,973
but there's a town up ahead,

215
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,433
and... and people
there can help us.

216
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,386
You just... you just need
to keep going forward, please!

217
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,867
So, you're gonna
watch these things,

218
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,245
get a sense of how
they move and what they do,

219
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,872
and that's gonna what?

220
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,917
Give you some grand insight
into how you're gonna catch one?

221
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,121
Yeah. Something like that.

222
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,965
Yeah. Okay.

223
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,209
I'm sure nothing terrible
is gonna come of that.

224
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,137
Why are you here?

225
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,056
What do you mean?

226
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,225
I said we could switch.

227
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,895
You could be fast asleep by
now in the sheriff's station.

228
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,939
So, why are you here?

229
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,184
That's none of your business.

230
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,074
What the fuck
do you care, anyway?

231
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,243
'Cause if I gotta stand here
all night and listen to you,

232
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,079
I'd at least like
to know why that is.

233
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,039
Look, if you're
gonna do something

234
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,249
that has even
the slightest chance

235
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,001
of getting us
the hell out of here,

236
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,085
no matter how stupid
or ill-advised

237
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,172
that thing might be...

238
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,965
then I wanna help.

239
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:42,970
Oh. So, now, all of a sudden,
you're a team player.

240
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,264
If you'd seen
the things I've seen,

241
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,141
then you might be, too.

242
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,103
What are you talking about,
seen the things you've seen?

243
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,431
What do you think
I'm talking about, Boyd?

244
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,944
Me, Julie, Marielle,

245
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,398
wherever we were.

246
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,327
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

247
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,954
Well, I don't think
that's the worst thing

248
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,532
that can happen to you here.

249
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,244
I want out.

250
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,298
[fire crackling]

251
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,175
[pencil scribbling]

252
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:25,213
[groaning softly]

253
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,223
You should get some sleep.

254
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,184
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

255
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,393
Sorry.
Did I wake you up?

256
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,514
No. The, uh, throbbing pain
in my ankle did.

257
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:41,153
Is there anything I can
do to help make it better?

258
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,239
[groaning]

259
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,277
No, not until, uh, some
of the swelling goes down.

260
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,406
What are you writing?

261
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,003
It's just, uh,
something for my mom.

262
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,339
In Chinese culture,
we write letters to the dead

263
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,092
on high holidays.

264
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,052
It's not really a holiday,
I guess, but...

265
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,179
I think she'd really like that.

266
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,390
Yep.

267
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,183
I meant what I said earlier.

268
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,353
You're not alone here.

269
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,397
Things are different now.
That's all.

270
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,108
Yeah.

271
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:23,271
It just feels like
all of a sudden...

272
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,609
...everything that I thought
I was fighting for is gone.

273
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,324
And everything that I thought
I was going home to.

274
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,086
And the two people that
I would talk to about that

275
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,339
are you and Mom.

276
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,217
You can still talk to me.

277
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,338
[Jade] Could you maybe
talk in the morning?

278
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,633
Sorry.

279
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,144
[sighs] Fuck it.

280
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,430
[grunts] I'm awake.

281
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,650
Hey.

282
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,328
[groaning]

283
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,656
You guys wanna hear
something crazy?

284
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,295
The night everyone died,

285
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,463
I was in the root cellar.

286
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,342
My mother told Eloise and I
to hide there.

287
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,337
Eloise didn't listen.

288
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,679
But I did.

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,357
I stayed until morning.

290
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,163
And when I came out,

291
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,532
there were bodies everywhere.

292
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,456
That was the day that
I met the boy in white.

293
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,135
You know the boy in white?

294
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,637
He's my friend.

295
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,224
He was my only friend all
those years that I was alone.

296
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:21,681
[creaking]

297
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,530
Couldn't bury them all.

298
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,448
They were just lying there
in the street,

299
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,569
and I... I couldn't bury them.

300
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,541
So the boy in white told me

301
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:45,580
to gather things that were
precious to them.

302
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,752
To bury those instead.

303
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:58,225
This stuff...

304
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,470
that'll help you remember
why it happened?

305
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,514
I think so.

306
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,726
Why are we in here?

307
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,438
Because it's a fort.

308
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,531
Why do you need me?

309
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,527
Because I don't want
to do this alone.

310
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,575
I may have to remember
some scary things.

311
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,419
And you're the scariest
person here,

312
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,497
so it won't scare <i>you.</i>

313
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,388
You always this fidgety?

314
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,390
Something's wrong.

315
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,392
Those things should be
all over the place by now.

316
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,560
Really?

317
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,312
These things give
"creature of habit"

318
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,481
a whole new goddamn meaning.

319
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,565
The one in the nurse's uniform?

320
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,276
I'm her first stop every night,

321
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,444
every single night.

322
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,529
She just stands by the glass,
and she hums.

323
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,490
For about ten minutes,
she just stands,

324
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,283
taps on the glass
with her fucking smile.

325
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,536
And there's another one, right?

326
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,413
Likes to sit over there
by the swing.

327
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,374
- Okay.
- Just letting its legs dangle.

328
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,584
There's another couple like
to sit over there

329
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,419
by the pool, just...

330
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,463
Well, you really
watch these things closely.

331
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,632
Yeah, well, there's no TV.

332
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,634
Plus, you guys get to
draw the shades at night.

333
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,594
I got...

334
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,515
Look. The point is,
they got patterns, routines,

335
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,843
all of which should be
happening right now.

336
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,562
Right now.

337
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,606
Ma'am, you're
not making any sense.

338
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,442
I know this road!
There's a town up ahead.

339
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,527
The people there can help us
find the highway again.

340
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,278
- Okay.
- I promise you.

341
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,856
We just need to keep
going that way.

342
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,329
We're... we're here!
The barn is here!

343
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,622
- We're... Stop! Stop here!
- Lady, we're fine, okay?

344
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,374
We're not gonna stop
in the middle of nowhere.

345
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,376
Fuck.

346
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,377
[vehicle approaching]

347
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,629
Oh, shit. What the...

348
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,665
What the fuck?

349
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,795
It's an ambulance,
just like he said!

350
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,549
Hey!

351
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,719
Hey!

352
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,687
Mom!

353
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,522
Oh, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

354
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,523
- [Jim] Get in here!
- I got him.

355
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,524
- [Jim] Hey!
- [Ethan] No!

356
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,567
- [Boyd] Got him.
- No!

357
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,569
- Let's get back inside.
- No! Mom!

358
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,320
You need to stop.
Please stop.

359
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,530
Look, lady. I'm not gonna
tell you again, okay?

360
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,649
Shit.

361
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,453
- What's wrong?
- We got a body in the road.

362
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,581
What if Mom's really out there?

363
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,457
{\an8}- What's he talking about?
- Uh...

364
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,786
The voice on the phone said
she'd be on an ambulance.

365
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,338
There's somebody lying
in the middle of the road.

366
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,424
No. It's not
a fucking person!

367
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,508
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus! Hey!

368
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,593
- That is not a fucking person!
- Okay!

369
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,636
We're just gonna calm down, okay?

370
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,346
- No, no, no!
- Go ahead. I got this.

371
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,556
You are not fucking
listening to me.

372
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,474
Where are you going?
Don't go.

373
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,393
- Please don't fucking go!
- Ma'am!

374
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,895
- [officer] Move!
- Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am.

375
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,563
- You're gonna fucking die!
- Okay. You need to calm down!

376
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,690
You need to fucking calm down!
They're gonna die!

377
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,601
They're gonna fucking die!

378
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,491
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

379
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,576
Ma'am, can you hear me?

380
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,745
- Okay.
- Here. Help me roll her over.

381
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,538
Come on.

382
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,741
Watch her head.

383
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,627
I'm not getting a pulse.

384
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,545
Hey, guys!

385
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,589
Lady's really freaking out
back here.

386
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,383
What the...

387
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,385
- [screeching]
- Aah!

388
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,386
[screeching]

389
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,512
[grunting]

390
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,798
[choking]

391
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,683
Oh, my God!

392
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,685
Aah!

393
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,647
[groaning]

394
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,852
[screeching]

395
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,898
Back up!

396
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,693
[firing shot]

397
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,745
[gun firing twice]

398
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,705
- Okay.
- [Julie] Those were gunshots!

399
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,658
Which means those things are
already out there.

400
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,705
[panting]

401
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,715
[panting]

402
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,560
Oh, my God. Henry?

403
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,480
- [groaning] What?
- It's okay.

404
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,773
- What?
- We're okay.

405
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,526
If there's even a chance
my wife is out there...

406
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,686
You do what you want.

407
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,823
Okay. Listen.
You gotta stay inside.

408
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,783
Whoever's on that ambulance,
you'll be putting them

409
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,452
in danger if we have to worry
about you, okay?

410
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,745
I need you to
tell me you understand.

411
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,788
- I understand.
- Julie?

412
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,990
Yeah.

413
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,627
We are in real danger right now.

414
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,587
There are things in this town
that will hurt us

415
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,464
if we don't get inside
one of the houses.

416
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,590
- [creature screeching]

417
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,675

00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,677
Oh, mother of God!

419
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,046
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

420
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,724
Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

421
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,600
Tabitha.

422
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,762
Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

423
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,689
Help me! Help me!

424
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,566
Please help me, baby!

425
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,818
- Please help us!
- Are there keys?

426
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,653
I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know where they are!

427
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,530
Everybody, out of
the ambulance, now!

428
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,774
Ah!

429
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,701
- Jesus.
- What the fuck?

430
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,662
- Handcuffs.
- What?

431
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,539
You have handcuffs.
Hand me the keys.

432
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,752
I... I... I don't
have them. I... No...

433
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,670
There's a toolkit
on the bus. I got it.

434
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,915
- No! Wait, wait!
- Got it!

435
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,759
All right!
Stay, stay, stay!

436
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,552
- [clanging]
- Runner on the hill!

437
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,928
Runner on the hill!

438

442
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,695

447
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,664
- [woman] What was that?
- Nicky's been shot!

448
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,874
[Marielle] Excuse me.
Excuse me.

449
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,876
- [Nicky groans]
- [Ellis] What happened?

450
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,669
- Did she hit her head?
- I don't know.

451
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,712
Get that window boarded up.

452
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,047
Um, here,
get her onto the couch.

453
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:06,593
- [people shouting]
- [man] Let her have some air.

454
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,720
- [Marielle] Come on.
- All right. All right.

455
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,640
[people chattering]

456
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,974
- [man] Did you see?
- It's Nicky?

457
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,810
Hey, Nicky. I'm Marielle.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

458
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:18,730
- [man] Easy, easy.

459
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,899
Help me roll her onto her side.
Okay. All right.

[Nicky shouting in pain]

461
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,146
Okay. No exit wound.
We need to get this bullet out.

462
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,615
- [rattling, knocking]
- Hey, open up!

463
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,991

- Hey, move.

464
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,284
- What are you doing?
- [cop] Please! Open the door!

465
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,912
She's a cop. We can't just
leave her out there.

466
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,705
We should wait for Kristi.

467
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,249
Kristi's not back until
tomorrow.

468
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,959
We need to do this now. Hey, I'm
gonna need a lot of things...

469
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,919
uh, tweezers, pliers,
uh, alcohol, and towels.

470
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,879
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

Oh, God. Those things were
coming from everywhere.

00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,650
- Back off!
- I didn't mean to... No. Listen.

480
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,652
You gotta believe me.
Please, you gotta believe me.

481
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,987
- It must have been a misfire!
- I said back the fuck up!

482
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,906
Oh, God. This isn't real.

483
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,825
This isn't real. This...
this can't be happening.

484
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,951
This isn't real.

485
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,953
- Is there anyone with you?
- What?

486
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,789
- Is there anyone else out there?
- Is she gonna be okay?

487
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,707
How did you get here?

488
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,792
We were in an ambulance.

489
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,203
There was this... this...
this tree.

490
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:29,168
[insects buzzing]

491
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,215
Where are the...
can't find the fucking keys.

492
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,687
Get the fuck back.

493
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,731
I said get the fuck back!

494
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,816
Oh, sweetie,
it doesn't work that way.

495
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,227
[grunting]

496
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:53,742
Hey, get back to the bus!

- Take them.
- [panting]

507
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,097

- [buzzing]
- [choking, coughing]

509

00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,844
Fuck you! Fuck you!

[creature screeching]

519
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,107
Apply pressure right here.

Hey, hey. Are you

Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

524
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,785
Sit here.

525
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,786
Hold her legs down.

526
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,037
Okay. Okay. I got it.

527
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,873
- [Marielle] Keep her still.
- [Nicky moaning]

528
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,041
- [Ellis] Come on.
- [Marielle] Okay. Yeah.

529
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,084
- Little sting.
- [Nicky shouting]

530
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,795
I know. I know. I know.

531
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,755
Shit. Okay. Let me see.

532
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,090
- Okay.
- [Marielle] Okay. Let me see.

533
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,001
Bite down. Bite down.

534
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,886
- Hold her very still.
- [Ellis] Come on, Nicky.

535
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,930
- [Marielle] Here we go.
- [Nicky shouting in pain]

536
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,140
- All right. Here we go.
- [shouting]

537
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,017
- I know. I know.
- [Fatima] You got this.

538
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,978
- [Marielle] All right.
- [Fatima] It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,105
[Nicky shouting]

540
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,106
Okay. I think I got it.

541
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,900
[Nicky shouting]

542
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,943
Okay.

543
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,071
[Nicky shouting]

544
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,865
Okay. I got it.

545
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:57,949
[Nicky shouting]

546
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,075
Yeah.

547
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,277
Good job.

548
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,830
There's a woman
in the ambulance.

549
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,165
There were two paramedics
outside, and I don't know

550
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,201
where she is, but this is
probably 20 minutes...

551
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,048
It's okay.

552
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,142
- Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes!
- That's it. That's it.

553
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,978
- Yes! Thank you!
- All right. Can you get up?

554
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,979
- Yes.
- Yeah?

555
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,939
Henry, let's go.
Let's go, Henry.

556
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,141
- And you? Can you walk?
- I think so.

557
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,111
[Henry moaning]

558
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,988
Come on. Come on.
I got you. I got you.

559
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,198
[moaning]

560
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,358
You okay?

561
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,163
[shuts off engine]

562
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,998
- [Boyd] I got him!
- Oh, my God! Hurry!

563
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,958
I got him. I got him. I got him.
I got him. Come here.

564
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,126
- Come here.
- [creature screeching]

565
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,211
I got you. I got you.

566
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,004
Let's go.

567
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,840
[people murmuring quietly]

568
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,133
[Boyd] There you go.
Come on.

569
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,177
[people murmuring excitedly]

570
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,929
- Oh.
- [Boyd] There you go.

571
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,382
- There you go. Close that door.
- [Henry moaning]

572
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,184
[door closes, metal clattering]

573
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,062
[people murmuring]

574
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,389
You okay?

575
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,858
Look.

576
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:14,984
[people murmuring]

577
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,439
- [man] Bad idea.
- [people murmuring]

578
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,952
Hey, what happened?

579
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,405
Uh, it was a long night.

580
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,998
For everyone, it seems.

581
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,243
[people murmuring]

582
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,414
I fucking told you.

583
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,010
Donna, can we, uh...

584
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,298
Uh, you can. Uh, I'll put you
in a room upstairs.

585
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,975
Are you okay?

586
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,102
Yeah. Come on.

587
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,430
[people murmuring]

588
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,279
That poor girl.

589
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,197
Nicky's gonna be all right.

590
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,033
No. I'm not talking
about Nicky.

591
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,203
I'm talking about Fatima.

592
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,490
That horrible bird.

593
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,495
What if it was a sign?

594
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,378
What's wrong?

595
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,298
Am I awake?

596
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,185
Where are you going?

597
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,285
Help me.

598
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,048
- Please!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,252
[chattering in distance]

600
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,141
Can you see anything?

601
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,060
No.

602
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:15,389
What if they don't come back?

603
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,191
Don't think like that.

604
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:22,153
They'll come back.

605
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:27,158
Julie, what happened to you?

606
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,238
What do you mean?

607
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:35,291
Ever since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

608
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,210
you've been different.

609
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,247
Are you sure you're okay?

610
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,379
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

611
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,183
I don't believe you.

612
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,351
You know I'm not a baby anymore.

613
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,595
You can tell me things.

614
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,519
You wanna know the truth?

615
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,275
I'm really scared.

616
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,372
I saw things that I
don't really understand.

617
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,534
There's things that
I can't even remember.

618
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,378
All I remember
is being more scared

619
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,581
than I've ever been
in my entire life.

620
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,419
And that's the truth.

621
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,340
I haven't told anybody but you.

622
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,468
I'm trying really hard
to be okay.

623
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,186
Can I help?

624
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:41,232
[chuckles] Hey,
I'm the big sister here.

625
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,519
I'm the one who
takes care of you.

626
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:50,074
If they don't come back,
it'll just be us.

627
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,611
We have to start taking care
of each other from now on.

628
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:04,130
They'll come back.

629
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,174
So, the rod was through his eye?

630
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:10,136
Mm. Well, only when
he was on the tree.

631
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,431
When he walked up to me
with a skull full of blood,

632
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,226
it was just a...
a bloody, empty socket.

633
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,603
- Jesus.
- [Jade sighing]

634
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,314
Yeah. So, that's what
my life's been like lately.

635
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:25,193
How long has this been
going on for?

636
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,195
The hallucinating?

637
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,239
Pretty much since I got here.

638
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,200
Do you remember that day I took
you down to the root cellar,

639
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,451
told you I saw that
symbol up on the ceiling?

640
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,453
You thought I was crazy?

641
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,531
[sighing]

642
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,706
Tian-Chen saw me in the diner.

643
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,385
I was drawing the symbol over
and over again, losing my mind,

644
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,304
and first, she made me tea.

645
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,473
And then she took me back
into the storage room,

646
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:59,143
and she, uh...

647
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,554
she pulled out this.

648
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,601
Still have no idea
how she knew it was there.

649
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,689
My mom knew every inch
of that storage room.

650
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,324
[chuckling]

651
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,201
You know, I thought
I was smart enough

652
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,695
to figure this place out, and...

653
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,374
I should have...

654
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,576
Fuck.

655
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,498
She really liked you,
you know? My mom.

656
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,261
I think she tolerated me
more than anything.

657
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,548
[Kenny] No, no, no.
I mean, she really, uh...

658
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,477
She only frowned
at people that she liked.

659
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:45,565
I mean, the people that
she didn't, she just... ignored.

660
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,601
[chuckles]

661
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,774
[Kristi grunting] Ow.

662
00:33:56,452 --> 00:34:00,329
When you finish that letter,

663
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,698
tell her we all say hi.

664
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:11,299
[thudding]

665
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,467
- Jesus.
- [whispering] Shh.

666
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,510
It's okay. It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

667
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,262
[creaking]

668
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,306
Are you sure those things
you saw today

669
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,591
were hallucinations?

670
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,576
Uh, this belonged
to Mr. Gerber.

671
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:52,298
He always smelled like onions.

672
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,466
They grow wild in the woods,

673
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,836
so he would pick them
and eat them raw.

674
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,674
[sniffs]

675
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,769
- [rattling]
- Hmm.

676
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,867
Oh. This was from Delores.

677
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,624
She always cried lots.

678
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:38,670
Mm.

679
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,633
Mm.

680
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,721
- [grunting]
- What's wrong?

681
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,691
Nothing for Christopher.

682
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,810
Who was Christopher?

683
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,615
He was our friend.

684
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,701
He... he was nice,

685
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,578
but then he started
seeing the symbol,

686
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,908
and then he started
getting scary.

687
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,789
What?

688
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,750
[grunting]

689
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,510
No. This was a mistake. I don't
want to do this anymore.

690
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,429
- Victor.
- No! I said no!

691
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,514
- Victor!
- I said no!

692
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,475
- Victor!
- No, no, no, no!

693
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,560
- Victor!
- No, no!

694
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,353
- Victor! Victor!
- No, no!

695
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,646
- Hey, hey.
- [moaning]

696
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,643
Shh. It's okay.

697
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,771
You don't have to be afraid.

698
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,818
I'm the scariest person
in town, remember?

699
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,949
I know what's missing.

700
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,911
[Christopher in high voice]
Hello, Victor!

701
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,748
His name was Jasper.

702
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,959
I, uh...

703
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:02,796
