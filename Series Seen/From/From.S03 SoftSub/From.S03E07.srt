Nothing that showed up
on that machine anyway.

231

So, the way Kristi sees it,
either there's something there,

232

like the worms
that were under my skin,

233

things you could
have done different...

- No, it's not that.
- Well, it should be.

Look, if it's
some kind of fucked-up

240
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,562
worms-under-the-skin type thing,

241
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,940
then that's a bridge
we're gonna have to cross.

242
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,360
But if it's psychological,

243
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,864
if she's anywhere
near the place Abby was in,

244
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,742
then we need to figure out
a way to bring her back.

245
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,496
Okay, well, let's just...

246

247
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,335
And then what?

248
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,504
I'm gonna have a talk
with Kristi later.

249
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,923
Hopefully,
she'll have had time to, uh...

250
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,300
To what?

251
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,011
I don't know. Look.

252
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,514
Look, I...
I'm just telling you

253
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,350
'cause you and I promised not
to keep secrets from each other,

254
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,101
and she's
living under your roof.

255

Yeah, yeah.

256
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:38,192
About that...
While we're figuring it out,

257
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,612
I don't think it's a good idea
that they stay at Colony House.

258

two possibilities here,

262
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,541
and each one poses
a different kind of threat

263
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,751
to the people of that house.

I would wake up screaming.

00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:56,044
What you wanna do...
You gotta pay attention.

529
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,545
[engine sputters, turns over]

530
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,174
You turn it on,
you press in the clutch, okay?

531
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,551
Make sure this has been shifted,

532
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,887
then you're gonna
ease off the clutch, right?

533
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,597
[engine revving]

534
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,641
Voilà.

535
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,989
[sighing deeply]

536
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,750
Henry.

537
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,460
You need something?

538
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,797
I... could use a drink.

539
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,801
You know what?

540
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,515
So could I.

541
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,185
Let's go.

542
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,032
[clattering]

543
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,662
Who's in there?

544
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,042
Hello?

545
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,846
What the fuck are you doing?

546
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,181
You took my gun.
I want it back.

547
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,727
You... Get out.

548
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,646
Fine. Give me my gun,
and I'll be on my way.

549
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,149
Hey, hey, hey! I don't
have time for this today!

550
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,526
I don't give a shit
what you have time for!

551
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,320
You shot someone!

552
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,697
A girl is dead
because you panicked!

553
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,033
Yeah, I panicked because
I was being chased in the dark

554
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:52,994
by things that should only
exist in a fucking nightmare!

555
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,871
Well, they exist here,

556
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,874
and they're going to
continue to exist.

557
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,001
So, until you prove
that you can handle that,

558
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,377
there is not a chance in hell

559
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,630
you're getting anywhere
close to a loaded gun!

560
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,632
[chuckles]

561
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:09,010
I don't have to
prove shit to you.

562
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,720
You see this?

563
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,805
I'm a cop.

564
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,390
A real one,

565
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,726
not just walking around
in some hand-me-down blazer,

566
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,394
playing make-believe.

567
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:22,441
Right. And when did you
get out of the academy?

568
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,235
Two days? Three?

569
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,905
That's none of your business.

570
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:32,075
That's where you are wrong.

571
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,410
Everything about you
is my business.

572
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,412
This place is my business.
You know why?

573
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,914
Why?

574
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,750
Because I'm the one who
makes sure people stay safe.

575
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:44,420
I am the one who
keeps people alive!

576
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,091
Wow. Well, from what I hear,

577
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,927
you've been doing a pretty
shit job of that lately.

578
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,972
Get the fuck out!

579
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,937
Fucking place...

580
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:01,980
Hey...

581
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,238
Give me... my gun.

582
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,535
You want your gun?

583
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,413
Correct.

584
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,089
You want your gun.

585
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,009
[sighs]

586
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:37,141
[gun clicking]

587
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,853
[clicking]

588
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,780
There's your gun.

589
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,869
You get your bullets when
I think you deserve them.

590
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,293
[scoffs]

591
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,628
Hey!

592
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:15,178
The next time you come in here
without my permission,

593
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,846
you and me
are gonna have a problem.

594
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,476
Whatever you say, "Sheriff."

595
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,568
This fucking kid...

596
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,780
I'd ask you what
you were drinking,

597
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,824
but the menu here's
kinda limited.

598
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,290
Everything going
all right with Victor?

599
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,419
Things are going, um...

600
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,425
No, I don't think they are.

601
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,554
[coughs]

602
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,889
You okay?

603
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,891
Yeah.
[breathes deeply]

604
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,393
[exhales sharply]

605
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:08,397
I stood there today in his room,

606
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,484
and I... [sighs]

607
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,821
...I had a thought I'll never
forgive myself for. [sniffs]

608
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:18,825
I wished I had never come here,

609
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:22,537
I wished Tabitha
had never found me,

610
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:27,543
because it was easier
when I thought he was dead.

611
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,547
It was only for a second.

612
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:35,300
What kind of father
thinks that about his child?

613
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,267
Here.

614
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,769
Yeah. [sniffles]

615
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,153
- Mm.
- [glass clatters]

616
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,577
Are these the same ones
from your dream?

617
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,000
It's not just the stones;
it's everything. It's...

618
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,087
It's how it feels.

619
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,176
I still remember the fear
when I was running.

620
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,977
I started over there

621
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:32,064
and came to hide
behind the rocks.

622
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,483
Which one?

623
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,947
This one.

624
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,991
And then what?

625
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,784
Whatever was
making everyone scream

626
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,996
was on the other side
of this rock.

627
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,999
And I would look up and...

628
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,335
What?

629
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,587
I would wake up
every single time.

630
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,464
Okay, let's say you

631
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,759
actually did see this
place before we came here.

632
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,011
Yeah, like...
like Miranda did.

633
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,764
[Jim]
How does that help?

634
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:06,475
Maybe Aristotle got it wrong.

635
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,229
You know, free will
and determinism, it's...

636
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,692
Miranda said she was chosen.

637
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,861
Right?

638
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:23,408
If seeing this place,
you know, visions, dreams...

639
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,286
...if that's the proof...

640
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,207
and you saw this place
as a child?

641
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,334
You never really had
a chance, did you?

642
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:36,462
[Jim] What...
What do you mean?

643
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:41,133
If fate exists,
if you were destined

644
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:45,055
to come to this place
since you were a child...

645
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,391
...then, one way or another,

646
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,602
you were always gonna come
to that tree in the road.

647
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,240
How's Fatima doing?

648
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,409
Oh. [clears throat]

649
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,413
She's, uh... She's good.

650
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:13,332
You know, we're just taking
things one step at a time.

651
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,418
You don't have to pretend.

652
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:19,213
She told me about the rotten
food, about the cravings.

653
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:23,050
I realize
you don't know me very well.

654
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,304
But if you need anything,
I'm here.

655
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,770
We did an ultrasound last night.

656
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,440
There was a machine
on the ambulance.

657
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,276
And? Is the baby okay?

658
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,610
There is no baby.

659
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,779
When Kristi examined her,
she looked.

660
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,948
There was nothing there.

661
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,950
So, it's either there's
something inside of her

662
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,037
that isn't human,
that a machine can't see,

663
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,456
or this place
has just broken her mind.

664
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,749
[kettle whistling]

665
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,292
I just...
I can't lose her. I just...

666
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,793
[kettle whistle slows and stops]

667
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,879
You haven't lost her.

668
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,924
She's still here, Ellis.

669
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,260
A good friend once said to me,

670
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,305
"Enjoy every moment,

671
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:12,641
and don't grieve the living
before they're gone."

672
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,311
And that's what I told my family

673
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,522
when I got my diagnosis.

674
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,401
Are you afraid?

675
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,819
Of dying?

676
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,365
Sure, at first, I was.

677
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,160
And then I got angry.

678
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:34,246
And one day, I realized
just how small life is,

679
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:38,000
how it all goes by so fast.

680
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,628
You start to wonder
how it could be anything

681
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,172
but the beginning
of some grand adventure,

682
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,092
or maybe it's the middle,

683
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,177
but I don't think it's the end.

684
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,347
Not anymore.
Once I realized that,

685
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,558
things didn't seem so scary.

686
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,853
None of us get to stay forever.

687
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,606
I don't need forever.
I just...

688
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:05,194
Whatever I can do,
whatever you need...

689
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:09,699
well, it may not be much,
but I'm here.

690
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,702
Mm?

691
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,541
I'm sorry, but why?
I mean, you barely know us.

692
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,960
I'm old, and I have cancer.

693
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:24,381
I like a good love story.
That work for you?

694
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:30,636
Yeah. Yeah, that...
that works fine.

695
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,514
Hm. Come on.

696
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,078
[coughing]

697
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:01,709
[gasping in pain]

698
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,586
[breathing heavily]

699
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:07,006
[whimpering]

700
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:10,426
[screaming in pain]

701
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:13,554
[screaming] Help!

702
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:14,973
Help!

703
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,392
[gasping]

704
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,853
Help. Help.

705
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:22,229
Help!

706
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,689
[whimpering]

707
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,608
