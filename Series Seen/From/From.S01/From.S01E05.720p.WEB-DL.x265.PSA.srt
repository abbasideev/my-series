00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:01,984
Sure.

179
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:12,212
You and Kenny make
a really cute couple.

180
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,388
Oh, uh, no,
we're just...

181
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:15,868
We're just friends.

182
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,565
Why?

183
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:21,003
He's really sweet,
and he loves you.

184
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,484
It's complicated.

185
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,268
How?

186
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,315
Well, 'cause I...
[Sighing]

187
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:31,448
...have somebody at home.

188
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,409
At least I think she's...
still... waiting.

189
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,412
What's her name?

190
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,198
Mariel.

191
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,245
-Were you married?
-Engaged.

192
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,510
I wonder sometimes,
actually all the time, uh,

193
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:54,167
what it must be like for her,
thinking I, uh, abandoned her.

194
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:57,083
Um, how about you?

195
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,520
Do you have
anybody back at home?

196
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,478
No.

197
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:04,003
I... I was with someone,

198
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,311
but he wasn't...

199
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:13,099
It's better that
he's not around anymore.

200
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,537
It's just me and Nathan now.

201
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:20,584
He's all
I've got in the world.

202
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:24,284
Before we got
stuck here, I, um...

203
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:28,375
Things weren't
really very good for me.

204
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:31,030
Nathan was
the one who saved me.

205
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,034
Can I ask you something?

206
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,601
Yeah. Sure.

207
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,388
If there was
something you could do,

208
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:46,175
something that would
let you see Mariel again...

209
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,441
something that would let
everyone here go home,

210
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:55,010
even if it was something bad,

211
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:56,577
would you do it?

212
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,754
Wait,
what are you talking about?

213
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,628
I wonder sometimes...
about this place,

214
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,067
what it means...

215
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:10,112
why we're here.

216
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:15,248
If someone came up to you
right now and said,

217
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:18,120
"Do this one bad thing

218
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,081
and everyone
gets to go home,"

219
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:24,213
would you do it?

220
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,739
Well, we're...

221
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:30,350
we're speaking
hypothetically, right?

222
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,351
Yeah.

223
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,352
Okay.

224
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,570
Of course.

225
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,224
[Chuckles]
Okay.

226
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,486
Uh...

227
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:42,666
I mean...

228
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:45,234
Yeah, I'd, um...

229
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,237
I'd do anything
to see her again and...

230
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,761
And hey, I mean,

231
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:51,719
if that meant everybody else
got to go home too,

232
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,678
then, I think
that's a lot of good

233
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:58,030
for one bad thing.

234
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:01,990
Yeah.

235
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:11,260
Hmm.

236
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,610
[Exhales]

237
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:15,221
Tell me you
figured it out.

238
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,310
Oh, I-I did.

239
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,573
And the answer is 12.

240
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:22,750
[Chuckles]
Okay.

241
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:25,535
All right,
let's go over this again.

242
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:32,455
Everyone enters from different
parts of the country,

243
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,893
on different roads,
in different places,

244
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,243
and they all, presumably,
see the same tree,

245
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:38,722
same crows.

246
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,463
Jim, Jim...

247
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:44,641
everyone here has asked the same
question over and over again.

248
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,601
How does writing
them on the wall

249
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,168
going to make
any difference?

250
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:51,561
Because...

251
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:54,086
There are plenty of things in
the world that don't make sense.

252
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,391
Yeah.

253
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,567
Something here
is missing.

254
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:01,180
We just can't see it yet.

255
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,442
But we will.

256
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,488
Well, there's a question
we haven't asked.

257
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:19,285
No.

258
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:22,375
Why not?

259
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,205
Because it's crazy.
[Sighing]

260
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,341
I don't want
to know the answer.

261
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:41,263
You sure you're not hungry?
I was gonna make some oatmeal.

262
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:42,786
I'm not really hungry.

263
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,788
Thank you
for last night, though.

264
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,226
It's been a long time
since I've had a girls' night.

265
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:48,792
Yeah, uh, me too.

266
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,621
I mean, hey, no need to wait
for a medical emergency

267
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,450
if you ever wanna
do it again.

268
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,453
Oh, your brother's back.

269
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:00,500
Uh, he's very persistent.

270
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,329
Yeah, he is.

271
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,896
Are you... are you
sure you're okay?

272
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,681
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
He just... he cares a lot.

273
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,204
Yeah.

274
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:10,379
I'll see you later.

275
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:14,862
You're up bright
and early.

276
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,342
Sara, we need
to talk.

277
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:17,604
About what?

278
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,825
I'm so sorry I worried you.
I didn't mean to.

279
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,741
It's fine. I just need
to know what happened.

280
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,526
I was just...

281
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,311
I was standing
in the diner one minute

282
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,704
and the next,
I was on the floor.

283
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,793
I don't really remember
much other than that.

284
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:34,708
Why are you suddenly acting
like everything's okay?

285
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:35,665
I need to get
to the diner.

286
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,276
Mrs. Liu is
gonna be worried.

287
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:38,538
Sara!

288
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:41,541
I'm okay, I promise.

289
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,238
I love you so much.

290
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:55,729
Knock, knock.
You awake in there?

291
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,774
Yeah, come on in.

292
00:15:57,905 --> 00:16:00,342
Whatcha doing?

293
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,561
I'm making a list.

294
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:04,390
Of?

295
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,869
All the people
that are probably

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,523
wondering where
we are right now.

297
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,003
Oh.

298
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,874
I mean, it's gotta be
worse for them, right?

299
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:13,834
Not knowing.

300
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,444
Just...

301
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:21,059
I made one too.

302
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,584
Pretty sure everybody here
did at one time or another.

303
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:30,372
Who's on yours?

304
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:35,203
My grandparents
and my friends.

305
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,251
Boyfriend?

306
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,904
No.

307
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,515
Girlfriend?

308
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:46,823
No, there's
nobody like that.

309
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:49,696
I guess that's a good thing
though, right?

310
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:51,828
Just one less person sitting
around losing their minds,

311
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,787
wondering where you are.

312
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,703
[Exhales] Okay.
That's enough of that.

313
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,532
We need some fun, stat.

314
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:01,447
Get dressed and meet me
downstairs in five?

315
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:02,796
Why?

316
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:03,884
You'll see.

317
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,713
[Sighs]

318
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:10,499
[Metallic clanking]

319
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:13,633
Hey.

320
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:15,591
Hey.

321
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,594
No more work
this morning.

322
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,683
She's, uh,
making the list.

323
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,820
I think it's time we
show her the Brundles.

324
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,652
Just a fucking idiot.
That's special relativity.

325
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,784
Uh... Klein.

326
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,787
Hardy's.
Klein. Hardy's.

327
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,531
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen.

328
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,359
[Trudy] Where are you
going with that?

329
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,363
Sorry?

330
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,713
Is that a radio?

331
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:54,630
Uh... yeah.
Sort of.

332
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:57,590
Why are you carrying it around?

333
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:02,421
[Sighing]
Because it helps me think.

334
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,987
I'm sorry, I...

335
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,728
You're even cuter
when you're awake.

336
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,513
Excuse me?

337
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:09,645
I watched you when
you were sleeping.

338
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:10,951
I'm Trudy.

339
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:13,867
Okay.

340
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,825
Too bad you chose the town.

341
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:22,310
I would've rode you
like an alabaster dragon.

342
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:25,574
Bye!

343
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,764
[Door opening]

344
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,505
Morning, Sheriff.

345
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:46,900
I stopped by the diner, let my
mom know that Sara was okay,

346
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,858
and she made those
bread things that you like,

347
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:50,643
so I picked up
a couple of those.

348
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,473
Uh, Sheriff?

349
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,783
I'm gonna need you to
hold down the fort for a bit.

350
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:03,743
Is everything okay?

351
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,920
Everything's fine.

352
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,878
I'm gonna visit my wife.

353
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,358
It's been a while.

354
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,798
Okay?

355
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,800
Yeah, sure.

356
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,678
[Door opening, closing]

357
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:26,983
[Jade] What the hell?

358
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:30,639
You guys built a bar
