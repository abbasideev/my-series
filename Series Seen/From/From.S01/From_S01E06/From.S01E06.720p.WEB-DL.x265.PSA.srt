<i>Previously on From...</i>

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,650
I feel like I'm hanging
on by a thread here.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,419
Those things, they never run.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,379
They know there's only
so many places we can go.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,469
I think we're running out of
spaces on the board, Sheriff.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,339
I wish you had the luxury of
grief, but you don't, Boyd.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,339
These people need you.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,259
You need to be the one
to lead these people home.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,779
'Cause if you don't,
she died for nothing.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,669
Come on.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,259
Started getting tremors
in my hand a few weeks back,

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,689
which means the clock
is officially ticking,

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,829
but I have this crazy idea
that might actually work and...

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,789
And if it does,

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,049
I might be able to find a way
to get these people home.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,139
Something here is missing.
We just can't see it yet.

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,529
I need something to write with.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,879
Ask every question, right?

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,619
I don't just sit around

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,189
fucking accepting the world
as it is!

21
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,189
Someone is doing this,

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,939
and I'm not gonna rest
until I figure out how.

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,570
Jade!

24
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,729
I really like you,

25
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,639
and what's about to happen,
it's gonna save everyone.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,639
Where's my mom?
I want my mom!

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,519
You're doing this for her!

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,559
Let him go.

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,909
They told me this
was the last one,

30
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,890
then everyone gets to go home!

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,089
- Ethan, run!
- No!

32
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,999
You don't understand!

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,009
- Nathan!
- Nathan.

34
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,380
Nathan, please!

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,919
Where is she?

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,539
She ran off into the woods.

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,749
And?

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,579
And if she comes back before
dark, then we'll handle it.

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,759
And if she doesn't?

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,520
If she doesn't,
then it's handled.

41
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,739
Chaos and faith,

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,269
that is the duality
of our existence,

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,789
from the moment we first arrive,

44
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,380
and not simply
here in this town...

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,109
...but in this world,
in this life.

46
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,979
From the moment
we open our newborn eyes,

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,809
we are faced with a chaos we
cannot even begin to understand.

48
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,339
And how do we respond?

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,949
What is the very
first sound we make?

50
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,230
We cry out.

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,479
We plead for answers,

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,590
before we even have words to
give voice to the questions.

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,879
That's how we begin our
journey through this world -

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,879
terrified,

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,269
confused.

56
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,269
And so, we search,
and we strive,

57
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,189
and we stumble
through the chaos.

58
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,799
We spend our lives looking
for signs that somewhere,

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,289
somehow there's a meaning,

60
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,939
a purpose to it all.

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,580
And then, one day,
we find our faith.

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,169
Our faith that we are
each here in this world,

63
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,389
in this place,

64
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,349
as part of God's
mysterious plan.

65
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,089
In our faith, we understand
the chaos is the meaning.

66
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,489
It is in our struggle,

67
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,250
in our search,
that we find our purpose.

68
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,359
"Trust in the Lord
with all thine heart

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,000
and lean not unto thine
own understanding."

70
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,570
- Amen.
- Amen.

71
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,519
It's always... it's always nice
to see new faces.

72
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,500
Yeah, I'm, um...
I just came by to give you this.

73
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,089
We've been packing up
the other family's stuff.

74
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,009
I figured
they were yours.

75
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,749
Yeah.

76
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,009
How's Ethan doing?

77
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,359
Well, he's, um...

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,539
He's scared
and confused.

79
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,719
He doesn't understand why
Sara would try to hurt him.

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,040
Mm.

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,979
Has anyone seen her?

82
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,369
Not since she ran
off into the woods.

83
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,989
Mm.

84
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,069
I ran after her, but...

85
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,490
my knees aren't quite what
they used to be, I'm afraid.

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,989
Do you think
she's still alive?

87
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,429
It's unlikely
she survived the night.

88
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,829
Those Bible passages, did you...

89
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,259
Did you write
those from memory?

90
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,309
Yeah.
Word for word.

91
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,720
It tends to stick.

92
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,650
Um, what did you really come
here to ask me, Tabitha?

93
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,130
How do you know
any of this is real?

94
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,459
I mean...

95
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,379
It sounds crazy,
but are we dead? Are we alive?

96
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,190
I...

97
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,339
Would it matter?

98
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,429
I mean, for argument's sake,
let's say we're dead,

99
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,999
and we're all stuck here
together in some strange,

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,519
tormented purgatory.

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,139
What would be different?
We'd still be stuck.

102
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,269
We'd still be searching
for a way to go home.

103
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,449
All that would change is
the home we're searching for.

104
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,969
Yeah.

105
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,929
I mean, I'm guessing
I'm not the first person

106
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,319
to come to you
with that question.

107
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,149
Well, let's just say

108
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,069
I've had plenty of chances
to work on my answer.

109
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,740
Yeah.

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,639
But if it's any
consolation to you,

111
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,159
you were already here
when your vehicle crashed.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,209
You're alive, Tabitha.
Your family's alive.

113
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,360
So you can scratch that
question off your list.

114
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,299
Yeah.

115
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,429
Bye.

116
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,800
Yeah.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,150
We need to talk.

118
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,479
You all right?

119
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,649
Yeah, it...

120
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,129
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my brain around it, I guess.

121
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,699
I mean, it's Sara, you know?

122
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,229
She was always
so thoughtful, so nice.

123
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,269
- How's your mom taking it?
- It's hard.

124
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,390
You know, Sara was kind of like
the daughter she never had.

125
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,719
I been thinking about
what you said the other day,

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,109
about running out
of room on the board.

127
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,239
I was upset.

128
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,249
Well, it doesn't
mean you're wrong.

129
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,159
Something's changing here.
It's like...

130
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,289
like something's slipping away.

131
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,559
The other night, the talisman
worked out in the RV,

132
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,519
same way it does in the houses.

133
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,689
And?

134
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,959
And I've been thinking
that the only reason

135
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,919
we haven't pushed
further into the forest

136
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,699
is we didn't know
whether the talisman

137
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,460
would protect us out there the
same way it does in the town.

138
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,229
So...

139
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,189
I'm putting
together some supplies.

140
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,879
I'm gonna take the talisman

141
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,099
and go out in the forest
and I'm gonna see...

142
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,719
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

143
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,669
Kenny, what...

144
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,759
Hey! You don't walk away
when I'm talking to you!

145
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,239
Are you going alone?

146
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,589
Yeah.

147
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,639
And how far are you going?

148
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,249
As far as it'll take me.

149
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,729
I'm doin' this
to find a way out,

150
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,859
find a way home.
Isn't that the point?

151
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,689
Make sure we
all get home?

152
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,259
Honestly?

153
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,349
I'm not sure there
is a point anymore.

154
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,219
But if you're in that much
of a hurry to fuckin' die,

155
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,259
you should just go and do it.

156
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,510
Okay?

157
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,759
I got everything packed up.

158
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,279
It's ready to go to storage.

159
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,390
Oh, okay.

160
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,390
What are you up to?

161
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,490
Look.

162
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,639
There's no wire in here.

163
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,819
What?

164
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,299
In the cord.

165
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,429
When you want
to splice a wire,

166
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,949
you gotta strip away the coating
to get at the wire inside.

167
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,779
But there's no wire.
This is...

168
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,219
You know,
it's not actually a wire.

169
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,269
And the plug?

170
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,089
Look.

171
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,969
Look.

172
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,269
The outlets,
none of it makes any sense.

173
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,749
I mean, these lamps,
they shouldn't work.

174
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,489
Hello!

175
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,499
Ah, you, uh,
rollercoaster guy,

176
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,019
- I need your help.
- You don't knock?

177
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,069
I'm sorry, would you like me
to take off my shoes too?

178
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,419
You noticed the wire thing too,
huh? Fucking weird, right?

179
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,570
You're that asshole
that almost killed us.

180
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,289
Okay, look, first of all,
I wasn't driving.

181
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,379
Second, my best friend,

182
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,429
who I've known since fourth
grade, is dead. All right?

183
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,599
He's not walking around with
A little boo-boo on his leg.

184
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,599
So, how about we
just call that one even, okay?

185
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
Now, you guys wanna play house
or do you wanna go home?

186
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,500
Because I have an idea.

187
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,609
Did you know there's
not a single copy

188
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,789
of the Bible in town?

189
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,099
I mean, in our little
traveler's library in the diner,

190
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,279
there's at least a dozen Robert
Ludlum and Judy Blume novels,

191
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,889
yet...

192
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,960
not a single copy of
the world's most popular book.

193
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,490
I imagine you wonder
why you're here.

194
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,970
You've done such
unspeakable things.

195
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,190
And by the rules of the town,
you should be in the box.

196
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,900
Nathan told me
about the voices.

197
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,300
It's okay.

198
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,639
Sara, what if I
were to tell you

199
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,599
that despite the horrible
things you've done,

200
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,769
you can still help
the people of this town?

201
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,429
You could still
do something good.

202
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,020
I think Nathan would
like that, don't you?

203
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah?

204
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,160
Good.

205
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,319
Those are pretty.

206
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,749
Right?

207
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,099
You have a good eye,
Miss Matthews.

208
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,499
Oh, I just found
them like this.

209
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,969
Like what?

210
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,189
Arranged like this.

211
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,809
They were on the porch
on the side of the house.

212
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,069
Huh.

213
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,589
Well, it seems we have a phantom
florist running around.

214
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,310
Come on. It's laundry day.

215
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,750
Come on.

216
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,999
Ow!

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,609
Motherfucker! Come on!

218
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,930
Ugh.

219
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,129
These people are ding-dongs.
They stripped the car.

220
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,439
They leave behind the only
parts that actually matter.

221
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,529
They're not all ding-dongs.

222
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,489
Battery's gone.

223
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,969
Huh?

224
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,030
I said,
the battery is gone.

225
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,019
That means we gotta
go back to town.

226
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,799
Wait, just as soon
as I get this cable here.

227
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,109
Goddamn it, come on.

228
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,719
Why all the way out here?

229
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,069
We literally could've gotten
wiring from any car in town.

230
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,029
My friend, this is
a top-of-the-line Audi Q5.

231
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,339
Parts sourced from...

232
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,270
You really wanna pin our hopes
to some peasant model jalopy?

233
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,360
Yep.

234
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,840
You got all that?

235
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,519
Whoo!
We're doing it!

236
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,070
Science!

237
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,579
Good morning.

238
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,780
Uh, I'm dropping
these off for storage.

239
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,249
Hey.

240
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,429
Honey, she's not here.
She's not gonna hurt you.

241
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,039
Promise?

242
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,020
Yeah, I promise.

243
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,150
Come on.

244
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,330
Where should I...?

245
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,820
Wow.
Look at all this stuff.

246
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,499
Hey.

247
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,939
Don't touch anything.

248
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,029
Why?

249
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,849
Because this... this used to
belong to other people.

250
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,419
The people
who lived here?

251
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,469
Mm-hmm.

252
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,180
Oh.

253
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,779
It's like the cavern
of the lonely dragon.

254
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,599
Yeah?

255
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,649
When the Cromenockle was
lost in the rainbow sky,

256
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,919
she found a cavern where
the lonely dragon lived,

257
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,569
and it was full of stuff
that nobody wanted.

258
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,749
But for the lonely dragon,

259
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,789
all the stuff was treasure.
And guess what.

260
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,229
What?

261
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,929
In one of the
big piles of stuff,

262
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,319
there was the map
of the rainbow sky.

263
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,149
So, the lonely dragon
gave it to the Cromenockle

264
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,979
and then she
wasn't lost anymore.

265
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,679
So maybe we'll
find a map in here.

266
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,010
Yeah, maybe we will.

267
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,079
Mom?

268
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,869
Yeah.

269
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,150
What's wrong?

270
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,900
Nothing.

271
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,430
Yeah, this is it,
this one, right here.

272
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,669
Oh, this'll
never work.

273
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,199
Of course,
it's going to work.

274
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,589
No, it's not
nearly tall enough.

275
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,109
It won't have
the signal strength.

276
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,939
Yeah, listen, we can
deal with that, okay?

277
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,599
This is just a test run.
Look, you're an engineer, right?

278
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,029
Amusement parks?

279
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,819
Yeah.

280
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,859
Okay. So, I guess that
means one of us built

281
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,819
a multi-million-dollar
software company

282
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,190
and the other does, what,
safety tests on the teacup ride?

283
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,999
You know what?
Do it yourself.

284
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,659
Huh? Wait, no, no! Hey, look.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

285
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,619
People tell me I'm not great
when it comes to

286
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,789
talking to people.

287
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,049
You have no idea
what it's like

288
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,709
being smarter
than everyone you know.

289
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,189
Listen, okay, look,
the truth is...

290
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,099
I could really
use your help.

291
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,239
Yeah, you could.

292
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,889
This antenna,
it has to go up high.

293
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,679
That is the highest tree that I
could find, but I... I can't.

294
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,570
I get vertigo.

295
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,490
So, you brought me
out here to climb a tree?

296
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,580
Yeah.

297
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,169
Listen,
you don't like me.

298
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,850
All right? That's fine.

299
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,219
But if there's even
the slightest chance

300
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,590
this could work,
don't you want to know for sure?

301
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,860
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

302
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,579
Okay.

303
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,340
All right.

304
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,350
All right.
Pass me up the cable?

305
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,550
Kristi, you here?

306
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,959
Sheriff Boyd?

307
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,229
Kristi, hey.

308
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,009
I-I was just, uh...

309
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,139
I didn't see
you upstairs, so...

310
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,889
Everything okay?

311
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,889
I know you and Kenny are close,
and I was just, uh...

312
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,239
How's he doing?

313
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,199
Well, I mean...

314
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,939
I think he's...
been having a hard time since...

315
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,989
Right, right.

316
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,029
And I-I think he's
trying really hard

317
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,949
to be this person that he
thinks people need him to be,

318
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,859
if that makes sense?

319
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,429
Yeah.

320
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,169
Being your deputy and...

321
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,869
and I know
a big thing for him

322
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,919
is he doesn't want
to let you down.

323
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,439
I know. And I'm really trying
not to push him too hard.

324
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,309
The truth is, he needs
to be ready to lead.

325
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,839
Can I be honest
with you?

326
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,099
Please.

327
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,319
I get that you want to
prepare him for the worst,

328
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,690
get him ready to take your
place in case something ever...

329
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,889
But right now,
he's really hurting,

330
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,939
and I don't think
he needs a sheriff.

331
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,000
I think he needs a dad.

332
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,809
Goddamn it.

333
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,249
I'm sorry, I...

334
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,549
No, no, no.

335
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,949
It's...
It's not you. It's me.

336
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,249
It's...

337
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,079
If you don't learn
from your mistakes,

338
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,559
you're doomed to
repeat them, right?

339
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,129
I really didn't mean to...

340
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,240
- You didn't.
- No apology.

341
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,380
Thank you, Kristi.

342
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,509
People think the
Bible's a fixed object -

343
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,360
something written,
completed.

344
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,299
But how can
the story be finished

345
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,219
if all the players
remain on stage?

346
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,460
We call it
"the Good Book", but...

347
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,879
Did you know it's actually
comprised of 73 books?

348
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,210
Did you know that?

349
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,059
Matthew, Mark,

350
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,239
Romans, Corinthians.

351
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,480
Seventy-three books.

352
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,570
All filled with tales
of miracle and wonder.

353
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,949
But there's also
darkness in the Bible.

354
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,949
Gruesome, horrible things.

355
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,869
You know, since...

356
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,039
Since the night I arrived,

357
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,680
there seems to be a question
I keep coming back to.

358
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,250
Seventy-three books.

359
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,929
What if we,

360
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,759
the people of this town,

361
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,220
are living the book
that has yet to be written?

362
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,350
What if this is Book 74?

363
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,230
And, Sara,
what if we were chosen?

364
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,280
For what?

365
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,760
I don't know.

366
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,510
Which is why I need you to
tell me about these voices.

367
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,300
Please.

368
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,180
When's Dad coming home?

369
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,769
Soon, honey.

370
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,530
I don't think
he will be much longer.

371
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,270
What's wrong?

372
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,169
Nothing. I'm just...

373
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,949
Just admiring this piece
of lonely dragon's treasure.

374
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,320
It's pretty.

375
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah.

376
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,850
Why does that light
keep turning off?

377
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,340
I don't know.

378
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,059
How about you
and I have an adventure?

379
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,019
What kind of adventure?

380
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,279
Mm, some sort of,
um, treasure hunt.

381
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,979
Really?

382
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,289
Mm-hmm.

383
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,199
Yeah, the game's
gonna be called,

384
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,989
"Where does
the light come from?"

385
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,729
Sounds good?

386
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,159
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

387
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,989
Let's go. Okay,
we will need some tools, right?

388
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,999
Mm-hmm.

389
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,280
Ooh, I found your tool!

390
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,219
Let's see if I've...

391
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,030
found my tool.

392
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,720
Okay.

393
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,529
Let's move this.

394
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,300
Come on, honey.
I need you to push. Help me.

395
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,199
Okeydokey.

396
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,069
Now, this is your tool.

397
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,960
This is my tool. Ready?

398
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,360
Mom!

399
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,270
You're doin' great!

400
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,630
Here we go.

401
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,269
Hey, I'm snagged somewhere.
Can you see where it's caught?

402
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,969
Uh, no, not really.

403
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,300
Just, uh, give it a shake,
see if you can wiggle it free.

404
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,149
Yeah, that's it.

405
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,780
- You got it?
- Yup.

406
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,379
All right.

407
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,029
Okay.
How you doing up there?

408
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,450
Doing good.

409
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,320
Fuck!

410
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,500
Oh, Jesus.

411
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,610
No, no, no! No!

412
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,500
No, no, no! No, no!

413
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,730
No, no!

414
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,269
Hey. Hey.

415
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,279
Jade, wh...

416
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,279
Jade, Jade, right here.
Right here.

417
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,669
Listen, whatever it is,
it's not real. Okay?

418
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,459
There's nothing there.

419
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,329
Jade, I'm going
to help you up.

420
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,109
Come here.
Come here.

421
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,289
You okay? Huh?

422
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,639
Just get your
fucking hands off me!

423
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,249
What did you see?

424
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,580
Just fuck off, all right?

425
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,389
They said they wanted to help.

426
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,699
That they'd been here
a long time

427
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,349
and they'd been waiting

428
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,269
for someone to come
who would hear them,

429
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,229
someone who could help them.

430
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,529
Help them do what?

431
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,659
Help them escape.

432
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,839
Help them go home.

433
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,669
They said they were
just like us.

434
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,329
But why?
Why did you believe them?

435
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,369
Because...
they told me things,

436
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,809
things they couldn't know.

437
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,419
They told me those
two cars were coming

438
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,580
and to stand out near the edge
of town and I would see.

439
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,259
They said it happened before,

440
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,479
that two cars came
on the same day

441
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,659
and everyone died.

442
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,680
They said it was because of the
people in the cars, but if...

443
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,709
...if I did what they said,

444
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,910
that we'd be safe,
we'd get to go home.

445
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,669
Okay. How?

446
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,790
How would we get to go home?

447
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,029
- I don't know.
- Okay.

448
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,949
Do you still believe that
they were telling the truth?

449
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,670
They promised...
that Nathan would be okay.

450
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,890
They-they promised,
and now, now he's...

451
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,879
Sara.

452
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,359
Sara, listen to me.
Come here.

453
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,529
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Sara.

454
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,749
If these voices are real,

455
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,839
if something here is
communicating with you,

456
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,749
then that means you're
connected to this place

457
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,409
in a way that
no one else here is,

458
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,669
and that makes you
incredibly valuable.

459
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,849
Do you understand?

460
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,939
But we need proof.

461
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,589
We need to be able
to go to Sheriff Boyd

462
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,459
and tell him with absolute
certainty that you...

463
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,809
That I'm not crazy.

464
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,509
No, the voices,
that these voices are not simply

465
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,429
the product of a troubled mind.

466
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,559
So, Sara, I need...

467
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,649
Ow!

468
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,819
- Sara?
- Ow.

469
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,779
- What?
- Ow. No!

470
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,999
What?

471
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,999
- Sara.
- No! No!

472
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,999
- What?
- No, no, no!

473
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,699
- What?
- Please! Ah, no, no!

474
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,789
What?

475
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,359
- Sara, what is it?
- Ah, no!

476
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,449
What?

477
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,619
I need... I need...

478
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,619
Need what?

479
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,889
Paper.

480
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,000
Paper.

481
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,050
They want me to
show you something.

482
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,910
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

483
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,270
Hello?

484
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,750
Is anybody there?

485
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,770
I don't want any tea!

486
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,210
You realize I have no
idea what you're saying.

487
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,310
Fine.

488
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,639
It's good.

489
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,670
Thanks.

490
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,070
I keep seeing it.
I-I keep...

491
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,290
I keep having these, uh...

492
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,990
Hey, where are you going?

493
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,080
Hello?

494
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,430
Where'd you go?

495
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,989
Holy shit.

496
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,559
This is all the, uh...

497
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,949
Wow. Oh, wait, wait!
Hold on.

498
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,060
Slow down, Tian.
I got this.

499
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,569
What...

500
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,850
What are you looking for?

501
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,749
What is that?
It's a yearbook.

502
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,380
1972?
How many people...?

503
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,189
Okay.

504
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,979
Well, I mean, could you tell me
what you're looking for?

505
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,350
Shh.

506
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,830
What's that?

507
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,450
Hmm?

508
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,990
Oh, what the fuck?

509
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,069
Please...

510
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,570
I can't...

511
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,529
I don't...

512
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,879
What is this?

513
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,409
They said...

514
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,059
They said they watched you
on the day you got here.

515
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,759
They said they
watched you bury the bag

516
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,480
and that this is proof
that they're real.

517
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,400
Do you know what that means?

518
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,510
Oh!

519
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,170
Ah! Here we go.

520
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,250
Okay.

521
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,319
Yeah.

522
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,520
That's it.
There we go.

523
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,639
Hey.

524
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,350
Sheriff Boyd.

525
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,249
Ladies.

526
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,270
Hi!

527
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,320
Fuck!

528
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,670
Come in.

529
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,330
Hey.

530
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,539
I was, uh, going through my
things back at the station,

531
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,969
and I realized I haven't thrown
a ball around in a while.

532
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,799
Come on outside.

533
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,719
You can help an old man
knock the rust off.

534
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,040
I'm good.

535
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,719
Hey, I ever tell
you, uh,

536
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,989
I played first base
back in college.

537
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,819
No.

538
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,469
Yeah, I was
pretty good too.

539
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,299
Had a couple scouts
kicking around.

540
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,129
Here I am,
18 years old, thinkin',

541
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,129
"Man, I might
be going to the show,"

542
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,349
"be the next Willie McCovey."

543
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,640
What happened?

544
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,749
Oh, you know...

545
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,040
life had other plans.

546
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,350
Life always seems
to have other plans.

547
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm sick, Kenny.

548
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,429
What do you...?

549
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,779
Have you talked
to Kristi about it?

550
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,909
Not that kind of sick.

551
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,219
My father was diagnosed
with Parkinson's

552
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,959
when he was around my age.

553
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,439
It's not supposed
to be hereditary.

554
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,829
The doctors all
swore up and down

555
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,879
how extremely rare
that would be.

556
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,919
Wrong time to win
the lottery, I guess.

557
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,359
But how do you know that...?
How do you know?

558
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,799
I mean,
it could be anything, right?

559
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,560
It is what it is.

560
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,549
Look...

561
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,790
this thing is already
chipping away at me.

562
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,989
And eventually, I'm gonna get
to the point where I can't...

563
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:59,079
I'm not gonna be able to protect
these people anymore.

564
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,299
So I gotta find us a way out
while I still can.

565
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,869
You understand?

566
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,649
The only way
I can do this

567
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,739
is because I know these people
are gonna be in good hands

568
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,770
when I'm gone.

569
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,879
There's a lot of folks
in this town

570
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,099
who are alive today
because of you.

571
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,189
And I know your dad
isn't around to say it,

572
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,929
but I promise you...

573
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,570
he's so goddamn proud of you.

574
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,369
I'm proud of you.

575
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,899
But if you tell me
right now

576
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,339
that you are not ready
for me to go,

577
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,509
that you need more time,

578
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,819
then I ain't
going nowhere.

579
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,710
Okay?

580
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,730
Well, we doing
this or what?

581
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,210
Doing it.

582
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,389
Hey? Anybody here?

583
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,869
We might be onto something
with this radio.

584
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,030
We're gonna have to get it
higher up, but it could...

585
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,160
What the fuck?

586
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,669
Hi, Dad.

587
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,969
Hey, kiddo.

588
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,239
What you up to?

589
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,589
We're on an adventure.

590
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,239
There's a lot of dirt,

591
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,629
so mom said I should
bring some outside.

592
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,109
Uh-huh.
And where is your mother?

593
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,830
In the basement.

594
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,139
Tabitha?

595
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,579
Hey. Hey.
How'd things go?

596
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,839
Good.

597
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,139
Yeah?

598
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,889
We got some static, so...

599
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,759
Yeah, well,
that's wonderful, right?

600
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,589
Yeah, it's a start.

601
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,369
What you doing?

602
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,279
It's like you
said this morning,

603
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,769
it has to come from somewhere,
right? The electricity.

604
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,199
There's no power lines,
and all the wires,

605
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,949
all the cords, they just...

606
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,899
they just go down,
straight down.

607
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,649
It's so weird.

608
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,649
Okay. Uh, sorry, can you...

609
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,569
not dig for a moment?

610
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,980
Yes.

611
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,739
What's going on?

612
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,900
Okay.

613
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,470
Do you remember
the bracelet I made you?

614
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,489
The what?

615
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,889
The bracelet I made you
after our first few dates,

616
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,759
from, uh, the laces of
your father's boots.

617
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,329
Yeah, of course, I remember.

618
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,719
Okay. Remember,

619
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,639
you lost it at the hospital
the night Julie was born.

620
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,719
Okay.

621
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,920
Turn around.
Look what's sitting there.

622
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,919
Okay, I still don't get it.

623
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,739
You're saying
you found a bracelet

624
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,089
that's similar to
the one you gave...

625
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,919
No, no, no, no.
It's not similar.

626
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,709
That is the bracelet.
Those are the laces

627
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,749
from your father's boots!

628
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,749
No, those were generic
rawhide laces,

629
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,929
the same you'd find on any boot.

630
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,889
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look. Look at this.

631
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,889
Look at this.

632
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,499
What?

633
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,239
This was an accident.
I made this.

634
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,939
I was so afraid I ruined it,
but then, when I gave it to you,

635
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,069
you said, "Accidents... "

636
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,639
"Accidents are the best part."

637
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,509
Yes. Why?

638
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,989
Ah, because it makes
it one of a kind.

639
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,970
Exactly.

640
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,999
It's impossible.

641
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,259
Jim, everything
about this is impossible.

642
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,779
That doesn't
make any sense.

643
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,569
Those wires
don't make sense.

644
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,049
We may not be able to
find out how this got here,

645
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,250
but we can find out
where those wires go.

646
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,080
Give me the shovel.

647
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,139
Where's yours?

648
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,810
First base.
I don't need no glove.

649
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,229
Are you sure?
Because I got some heat.

650
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,189
Just throw the damn ball.

651
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,279
You're gonna regret this.

652
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,799
I hear a lot of talking,
but I'm not...

653
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,690
Here comes the heat.

654
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:06,029
I think, uh...
Think maybe I'll carve us a bat.

655
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,079
That way, when you get back,
we can do this right.

656
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,710
When I get back, huh?

657
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,190
Yeah, when you get back.

658
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,200
Yeah.

659
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,640
They're so beautiful.

660
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,659
I'm so glad you like them.

661
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,820
When can I come inside?
