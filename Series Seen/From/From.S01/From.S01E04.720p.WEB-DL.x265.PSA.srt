00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,001
You shouldn't have done that.

357
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,611
Victor's my friend.

358
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,701
Look, I'm sorry.

359
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,573
Just leave me alone.

360
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:43,720
[Fatima] You see that
one right there?

361
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,635
-Which one?
-The black one, right there.

362
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,290
-Uh, yes.
-That one is Armani.

363
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,640
It belonged to this guy
Charlie, from Duluth.

364
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:54,688
Oh, God, he was
this amazing cross-dresser.

365
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,038
Oh, he was so beautiful
and funny.

366
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,997
Ah! Anyway, when he...

367
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,523
[Clearing throat]
Well, Trudy got her hands on it,

368
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:05,220
and now she's always
trying to hide it,

369
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,222
so she doesn't have
to share it with anybody.

370
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,050
Since you're
on laundry detail...

371
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,181
It's up for grabs.

372
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,141
It's up for grabs!
Here, put it on.

373
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
I've never worn
Armani before.

374
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,797
Well, I think Charlie
would agree

375
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,060
it would look much better
on you than it does on Trudy.

376
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,149
Stop it.

377
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,456
[Gasping]
Ms. Matthews!

378
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:24,761
[Laughing]

379
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,676
It looks nice!

380
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,417
What?

381
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,030
If you want,
I can go talk...

382
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,380
No, it's fine.
I got it.

383
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,301
Hey.

384
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,260
Hi.

385
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,741
What are you doing up here?

386
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:51,440
Well, I found
your sweater in my bag.

387
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:57,968
We miss you.

388
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,538
I miss you guys. too.

389
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,196
Then come back with me.

390
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:12,548
Honey, this is not a prison.
You can leave whenever you want.

391
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,810
We'll...
[Sighing]

392
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,551
We'll talk to Donna about,

393
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,467
you know, you made a mistake,
that you've changed your mind.

394
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,642
I did...

395
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:22,602
Why do you
always do that?

396
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,168
Do what?

397
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,953
You make it seem
like poor, stupid Julie

398
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,737
doesn't understand
what she's doing

399
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,739
and that everything
will just be okay

400
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,176
once I admit that I was wrong,
like I always have to do.

401
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:33,961
No. I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

402
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,354
Yeah. You know what?
Forget it.

403
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:36,442
I really don't
want to do this.

404
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,792
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Julie. Julie.

405
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:41,011
We have no idea
where we are,

406
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,273
how we got here.

407
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,667
We have to stick
together as a family.

408
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,714
Are you kidding me?

409
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:49,237
You're seriously
gonna stand there

410
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,717
and lecture me about family?

411
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,154
I knew.

412
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,765
I knew what you
and Dad were planning.

413
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,680
I knew all about the divorce

414
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,682
and how this whole trip
was just one last hurrah

415
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,423
before you sat us
down to break the news.

416
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,773
So stop treating me
like I'm a child.

417
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,384
Okay, okay, Julie.

418
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,605
You're right.

419
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:16,177
Look, your father and I
love each other very much.

420
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:18,614
We love you and
Ethan very, very much.

421
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,921
Thomas is dead!
Okay?

422
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,010
And I know that it's hard,

423
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,578
and I know that you lost,
but we all lost.

424
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,319
You have two other kids!

425
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,321
Why aren't we
enough for you?

426
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,367
It's not that simple!
It's not that simple!

427
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,282
I can't do this right now.
Please, I...

428
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,154
I'm not trying to make
this more di... I'm sorry.

429
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,469
[Door slams]

430
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,214
-I'll make sure she gets it.
-[Tabitha] Yeah. Yeah.

431
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,218
[Jade] What the fuck is this?

432
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,742
[Kenny] This,
near as we could guess,

433
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:00,526
is where you and
your friend were driving

434
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,266
when you reached the tree.

435
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,268
But the RV that
the family came in?

436
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,835
They were driving here.

437
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,141
-Okay.
-Me and my parents,

438
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,925
we were in Austin, Texas.

439
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,275
Kristi, the medic?
She was in Detroit.

440
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,279
Every single one of these pins
is a different resident

441
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,456
who drove in from
a different location.

442
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,675
Yet somehow
we all ended up here.

443
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,202
That is fucking impossible.

444
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,116
[Chuckling] Yeah.

445
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,297
[Laughs]

446
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,169
[Snorts]
Okay.

447
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,605
All right.
Well, see?

448
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,389
That's the difference
between you and me.

449
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,479
-I don't do impossible.
-Right.

450
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:44,526
I don't just sit around,
accepting the world as it is!

451
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:49,313
Someone is doing this,

452
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,881
and I'm not gonna rest
until I figure out how.

453
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,623
Well, then you're
gonna lose your mind. Okay?

454
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,278
Because that's what happens
to people who can't adapt.

455
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,932
[Stammers]
They can't bend,

456
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:02,326
so eventually they break.
Jade, look,

457
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:04,372
every new person who comes
here just assumes

458
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,766
that it's just the monsters
they have to be afraid of,

459
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:07,810
but that's not
the hardest part.

460
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:13,120
It's what this
place does to you,

461
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,820
what it makes you
think and feel,

462
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,040
what it makes you question
about every single thing

463
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,825
that you think you know,
and-and if you can't if you...

464
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:26,089
[Static hisses]

465
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,004
Yeah, it does
that sometimes.

466
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:30,529
Look, I'm just
trying to tell you,

467
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,573
if-if you can't
understand that...

468
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,273
What are you...?
Wait, where are you going?

469
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:38,754
Jade!

470
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:49,635
Well, you look how I feel.

471
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:52,942
[Sighs]

472
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:54,770
Ethan's mad at me.

473
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:55,945
Why?

474
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,687
I, uh...

475
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:03,562
I thought you
were gonna unpack.

476
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,782
Yeah, I was.
But I went to see Julie.

477
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:09,698
How'd that go?

478
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,919
Well, as well
as you'd expect.

479
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:18,751
She knows.

480
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:21,580
What?

481
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,233
She knows about
the fucking divorce, Jim.

482
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,583
She fucking knows.

483
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:30,501
Everything's gonna be okay.

484
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,068
Oh, please
stop saying that.

485
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,243
What do you want me to say?

486
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:34,549
I don't know!

487
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,681
Say that-that you're...

488
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,119
That you're hurt,
that you're scared.

489
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,643
That this is all so fucked that
you have no idea what to do,

490
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:44,951
because I am walking around,
reminding myself to breathe,

491
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,127
and every time
you talk about

492
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:50,478
how things are going to be okay,
it makes the rest of us feel

493
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,871
that we're doing
something wrong.

494
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,829
That's not fair!

495
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,745
[Scoffs]
Fair?

496
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:00,575
I'm sorry, what part of the last
14 months have been fair?

497
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,751
[Jim] I'm tryin' to keep
a grip on things here.

498
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:05,014
It's not gonna do us any good
if we get hysterical.

499
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:07,103
[Tabitha]
No. You don't get to do that.

500
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,062
-I am not being hysterical.
-[Knocking on glass]

501
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,803
We wouldn't even be here
if we hadn't...

502
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:11,934
[Jim] What?

503
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,022
[Knocking on glass]

504
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,720
[Tabitha] Just forget it.

505
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,463
[Jim] Go ahead and say it.
Say it to my face.

506
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,944
[Tabitha] What was this trip
supposed to do, Jim?

507
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,120
What did you think
was gonna happen?

508
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,993
That we were gonna go
camping for a few days

509
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,212
and everything would just
magically get better?

510
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,562
[Jim] I'm sorry that I wasn't
just ready to cut and run.

511
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,434
[Argument continues
in distance]

512
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:34,478
Hi.

513
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,480
What are you doing
out here?

514
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:38,308
We gotta go find him.

515
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,180
The boy?

516
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,704
Yeah. I mean,
he's been gone a long time,

517
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,924
and we need to ask him
why he's back.

518
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,447
I'm not supposed
to leave.

519
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,318
Oh, but you have to

520
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,494
'cause he chose you,

521
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,149
just like
he chose me once.

522
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,977
Like a quest?

523
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,979
Yeah.

524
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,894
Okay.

525
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,548
But you can't take that.

526
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,984
Why?

527
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,857
Hm. No.

528
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:06,772
They're no good.

529
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,690
Those are for hospitals.

530
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,650

Okay. In that case,
you're getting a sermon.

540
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,208
How 'bout Psalm 23,
from the book of

541

"Cut the Self-Pitying
Bullshit and Be a Leader."

Look, what happened to Lauren
and Meagan wasn't your fault.

543

Frank putting himself in
this box wasn't your fault.

None of this is really
about them, is it Boyd?

545

about what you say next.

547
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,577

548

Before you got here,

553
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,986
I was burying more
people in a week

554
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,293
than you've seen die
in the last two years.

555
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:35,643
But you were the one
who found the talismans.

556
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,776
You created order
from chaos.

557
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,995
You made it possible for
people here to live again,

558
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,475

560

grief, but you don't, Boyd.

These people need you.

566
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,800
We went three months
without a single death,

567

use me as a punching bag?

to hold this place together.

right before the two cars came.
