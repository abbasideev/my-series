00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:02,219
<i> Previously on From...</i>

2
00:00:02,243 --> 00:00:03,682
Still can't
afford to buy a boat.

3
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:05,222
You know what they used
to call me in the army, right?

4
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:07,620
- Mr. Fish and Loaves.
- That's right! That's right!

5
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:09,622
No matter what the resources,
I would make it work.

6
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:11,943
- Dad!
- Oh!

7
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,765
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

8
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:20,066
It's Mom. I think this
place is starting to get to her.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,397
You've been going out there
for weeks now,

10
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,003
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

11
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,368
Help your Mom get everybody
secured, tucked away.

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,074
And when I get home tonight, we
will talk.

13
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:29,394
I promise.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,482
The only way for us to go home

15
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:41,857
is to wake everyone up.

16
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,639
Abby, stop!

17
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,993
I found something, s-something
I think is gonna help us.

18
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:47,511
Mom!

19
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,315
No, no!

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,361
They're in the house!

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,431
We have to go.

22
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,686
Go where? Where are we going?

23
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,369
You go first.

24
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,195
I'll follow you down.

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,910
We need to get to town.

26
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,177
No. We have to go to the trees.

27
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,432
You have to get inside.

28
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,532
The tree? No!

29
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:09,676
You'll be safe!

30
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,238
- What?
- I promise.

31
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:12,679
- Go, go!
- No, wait!

32
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:15,436
Find your brother.
I'll be right behind...

33
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:19,389
You went through a Farway tree!

34
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,720
- Honey...
- What is going on?

35
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:22,282
What's happening?

36
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,933
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

37
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:27,595
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

38
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,036
Is anybody out there?

39
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,688
All I got was some static,
but it worked.

40
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:34,536
I think if we get it up
over the tree line,

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,812
and we get it enough power,

42
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:37,308
I think we could get a signal out.

43
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:39,244
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

44
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:41,213
We start by going
to the high ground.

45
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:43,083
If these voices are real,

46
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,953
if something here is
communicating with you,

47
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,251
then that means you're
connected to this place

48
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,286
in a way that no one else here is.

49
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,287
But we need proof.

50
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,783
What is this?

51
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:53,060
They said they
watched you bury the bag

52
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:55,986
and that this is proof
that they're real.

53
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:58,461
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

54
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,902
Tell me you're joking.

55
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,937
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

56
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,995
That girl may be
the way we all go home.

57
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,470
Let's take a walk.

58
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,494
Where are we going?

59
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,771
Find our way home.

60
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,628
How do you know this
is the right way to go?

61
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,586
I don't.

62
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,821
I'm just following my best hunch.

63
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,459
Based on what?

64
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,466
Based on that.

65
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:05,055
What is that?

66
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,859
I don't know.

67
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,818
No idea.

68
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:12,722
But it's, uh...
It's where I found these.

69
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,867
Okay.

70
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,671
We're gonna camp out
here for the night.

71
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,827
But it's not dark yet.

72
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:22,017
Hey, look, this right here
is as far as I've ever gotten.

73
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,678
Once we go beyond this point,

74
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,922
we're in completely
uncharted territory,

75
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:28,584
and I'm not about to do
that two hours before dark.

76
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,312
We camp here. Go inside.

77
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,061
Will you at least take these off?

78
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:34,711
No.

79
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:37,252
I have to go to the bathroom.

80
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,727
Well, that's why I cuffed you in front.

81
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,026
Don't go far.

82
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,379
Hey, you.

83
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,414
Hey.

84
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,877
I, uh, finished Chapter 6.

85
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:42,988
Ah.

86
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:43,967
You're up.

87
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,331
What do you think so far?

88
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,926
Well, it's not exactly my favorite,

89
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,972
but I'm interested to see
how things turn out.

90
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,436
You think there's
gonna be a happy ending?

91
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,801
I don't know. I guess we'll find out.

92
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,891
Get home safe, Sheriff.

93
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,596
You, too.

94
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,111
Great work today, everybody.

95
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,047
Come on in.

96
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,578
Hey, you okay?

97
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,459
Looking a little long in the face.

98
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:17,649
Oh, uh, that's genetic.

99
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,465
Get a good sleep tonight.
The real work starts tomorrow.

100
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,291
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,627
So, livin' in a jail cell now,
that's quaint.

102
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,003
It's temporary.

103
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,699
Right. Until we get
this miraculous tower set up

104
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,185
and send our radio signal
out to Neverland.

105
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,177
Hey. Cut the shit, all right?

106
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:42,883
Some of the folks in there need
something to feel good about.

107
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,875
Great. Let's play
make-believe. I'm game.

108
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:00,560
Tabby, are you hungry?
I made some dinner.

109
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:02,166
I'll be right up.

110
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,966
Ethan, I told you to pick up the toys!

111
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,684
Can somebody grab that, please?

112
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,459
Jim?

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,632
Grab the kids.
There's something's wrong.

114
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:17,307
Jim, answer me!

115
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:20,376
Jim?

116
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,780
Oh, my God.

117
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:23,218
He kept saying he was fine.

118
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:26,826
He was making jokes about the tower.

119
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:30,665
He...

120
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,961
Oh, that's backwards. Flip it.

121
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,996
Yeah. Just make sure it's flush.

122
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,690
That's it.

123
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:57,593
Hey, Kenny.

124
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:59,705
Hey. Jade's all set up
in the kitchen, uh,

125
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,476
with the batteries, and, uh,

126
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,841
I think we've got enough wire
and cords now for the cable.

127
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,008
All right, well,
we're gonna need more material

128
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,648
if we wanna get this
tower up high enough.

129
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:10,881
Right. I'll send
people down to the barn.

130
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,652
I think there should
be plenty of wood there

131
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:13,719
for them to scavenge.

132
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:15,545
- All right.
- Cool.

133
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,108
Hey, how you doing?

134
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,452
Had a rough morning.

135
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:23,322
Is, uh... Is Eric with you?

136
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:25,546
I need him to go on a supply run.

137
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,220
Eric's not coming.

138
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,732
Hey.

139
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,299
Mind if I join you?

140
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,014
I would not mind at all.

141
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,274
Hey.

142
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,984
You hear about Eric?

143
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,458
Yeah.

144
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,352
Yeah.

145
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:06,454
I-I didn't see that one coming.

146
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:15,539
It's weird, you know, this
radio might actually work,

147
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:19,444
and as amazing as that is...

148
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,446
I think part of me...

149
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,179
I think the idea that it might work

150
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,918
is scarier than the idea that it won't.

151
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:35,086
What do you mean?

152
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,891
I keep thinking...

153
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,566
"How do we go back now?"

154
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,616
After everything we've seen,
some of the things we've done,

155
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
how do we just...

156
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,941
And even if we can go back, how do...

157
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,578
I'm not sure we can
ever really go home.

158
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,854
We're not the same people anymore.

159
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,465
You know, when my dad...

160
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,798
came back home from Afghanistan,

161
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,671
he said that that
coming home from war is like...

162
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:25,334
it's like traveling
from another planet.

163
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:26,951
And then when you come back,

164
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,075
you can't tell if
everything is different

165
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,375
than it was when you left it or... or...

166
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,951
...or if it's you,

167
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:40,186
if you're the one that's changed.

168
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,024
What's it gonna be like for us?

169
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,232
This is the only place
we've ever known together.

170
00:13:56,873 --> 00:14:00,039
I'll be right back.

171
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,645
Where you going?

172
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:05,473
Go find a sharper knife.

173
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:07,575
This one's just taking forever.

174
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,890
Hey. Hold up a sec.

175
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,449
What are you doing?

176
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:26,298
Making sure we find our way back.

177
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,032
All right, let's go.

178
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,997
How do you know
it's not just like the road?

179
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,823
What's that?

180
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,759
It just goes in one big loop

181
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:52,762
and then brings you back to town.

182
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:55,864
How do you know this isn't the same?

183
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:00,165
How do you know we
won't just walk and...

184
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,002
walk and walk,

185
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:05,115
and then end up right back
in town where we started?

186
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,843
I don't.

187
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:10,549
Guess we'll see.

188
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,542
Let me ask you a question.

189
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:16,885
You say those voices told you

190
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,219
that killing those people
would get everyone home.

191
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,397
You ever stop to think
that maybe they were lying?

192
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,685
I don't want to talk about that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

193
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,909
I think, if we're gonna start
second-guessing

194
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,934
each other's decisions,
then that seems like

195
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:34,936
a fair question to ask.

196
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:37,268
So, what is it? What exactly

197
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:41,335
did they tell you that made you
willing to kill that little boy?

198
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:43,153
You wouldn't understand.

199
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,408
Try me.

200
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,411
They told me...

201
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,919
that those people were coming.

202
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,592
They told me that there
would be two cars!

203
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:56,958
And they said that if
I didn't do what they said...

204
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,730
Then what?

205
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,644
If you didn't do
what they said, then what?

206
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:06,264
Hey, let me explain to you
again how this works.

207
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,497
I say jump, you jump.

208
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,576
I ask you a question,
then you goddamn answer...

209
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,008
They said my brother would die, okay?!

210
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,783
They said that if I didn't do it,

211
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:22,786
that he would die,
that everyone would die!

212
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,369
Why didn't you just put me in the box?

213
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,196
I don't know! I thought...

214
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,674
Hey.

215
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:58,382
I've seen this town make good people...

216
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,025
do bad things.

217
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,197
Let's keep moving.

218
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:29,578
I don't understand.

219
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,030
Ethan said he thinks it's a puzzle.

220
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,647
No, not a puzzle.

221
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,385
A story.

222
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,068
They all fit together and tell a story.

223
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:38,730
And once we figure out the story,

224
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:41,029
we'll know what to do next.

225
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,900
That's how it works.

226
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,837
Yeah, um, I think
we should stop seeing these.

227
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:48,839
But we have to.

228
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,754
We can't finish the quest unless
we figure out the story.

229
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,943
I'm not scared, I promise.

230
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,538
I know.

231
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,685
Do you think Dad's tower's gonna work?

232
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:03,101
I don't know. I mean, we'll just
have to wait and see.

233
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,681
Where do you think this one goes?

234
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:08,562
Oh, yeah, this is super healthy.

235
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:10,234
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.

236
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:13,259
Okay. We should... We should stop.

237
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:15,602
Um, maybe we should play another game.

238
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,494
What kind of game?

239
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:20,200
Um...

240
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,532
Okay.

241
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,634
A game called "When I get home, I..."

242
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,790
And we just say whatever
we're looking forward to

243
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,649
the most about getting home.

244
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,541
I'll start.

245
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:35,116
When I get home, I...

246
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:39,054
I will go to Giovelli's

247
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:41,793
and I will order...

248
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:43,652
everything on that menu.

249
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:46,094
Maybe two of everything on the menu.

250
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:47,755
Your turn, Jules.

251
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,131
This is stupid.

252
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,407
Oh, come on, Jules.

253
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,837
Fine.

254
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:56,137
When I get home, I'm going to, um...

255
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:03,309
I'm gonna call my friends and...

256
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:06,378
I'm just gonna call them.

257
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,987
What about you?

258
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:14,188
When I get home, I...

259
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:17,026
I want us to be happy,
like we are here.

260
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:20,458
We never play games
around the table at home.

261
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:29,533
Okay, look,

262
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,603
most of these batteries are way
past their expiration date.

263
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,957
All right, we've got the
newer batteries from my car

264
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:39,629
and that giant lunchbox that
you guys were driving, but...

265
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,162
even those'd drain
in a couple of hours.

266
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:46,066
We need something that'll
keep this running for days

267
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,355
or weeks, right? Not hours.

268
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,170
What we do is we-we take the batteries,

269
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:52,974
we put 'em in the cars
and then we just run the cars

270
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:54,239
to recharge them.

271
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:55,702
And then what? Burn how much fuel?

272
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:57,704
Look, the point is,
you're either burning out

273
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,343
one vital resource or another,

274
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,675
which would be fine if this
was guaranteed to work,

275
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,545
but let's be honest,
man, it probably won't!

276
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,536
Hey. Keep it down.

277
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:17,053
Has anyone seen Victor?

278
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:19,561
Look, if you would just
take a look at the symbol.

279
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,585
Open the book!

280
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,225
What is wrong with you?

281
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,844
We have a legitimate chance here
to go home and you're...

282
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,763
You know what? Just go.

283
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,436
Go. Go, go find Victor.

284
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:39,438
Do whatever you want.

285
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,672
I'll stay here, and I'll
figure this out myself.

286
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:46,163
There's nothing to figure out.
There's no power source.

287
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,623
Jim, this isn't Gilligan's Island.

288
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,296
You're not gonna build a radio
with palm leaves and coconuts.

289
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,264
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

290
00:20:58,426 --> 00:20:59,931
Whatever.

291
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:17,107
What do you want?

292
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,223
I, uh... I heard what happened.

293
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,357
You okay?

294
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:24,426
Not my bathroom
the asshole hung himself in.

295
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,430
Shouldn't you be out there

296
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,872
rounding up supplies
or building a spaceship

297
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:32,302
or some shit?

298
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:33,644
I'm just saying, if...

299
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,868
if you want someone to talk to...

300
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,451
Oh, so, now you're sheriff,

301
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:40,486
you're gonna start
doling out words of wisdom?

302
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,412
One thing I always
appreciated about Boyd

303
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:45,447
is he minded his own business.

304
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:50,826
Well, I'm gonna take a few
people down to the barn,

305
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,828
salvage some more wood for the tower.

306
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:54,137
Maybe if you want to...

307
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,623
come with us or... I don't know.

308
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:58,163
You want wood?

309
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,932
We got plenty of wood.

310
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,762
Where are you going?

311
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:05,764
Let's get wood!

312
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,306
Donna!

313
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:10,472
Come on!

314
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,342
I'm saving you a trip!

315
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:14,179
Donna!

316
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:19,349
Donna! Hey!

317
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:23,617
Hey!

318
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,421
Donna!

319
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:26,818
Donna! Hey!

320
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:28,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

321
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:30,305
- Hey!
- Donna, wait, wait, wait!

322
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:32,373
Oh, calm the fuck down!
I'm not a fuckin' psycho.

323
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:34,771
You said we needed wood?
Let's get wood.

324
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:36,201
Wha...? Okay.

325
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:41,129
Donna, please.

326
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:43,351
Better here than any of
that half-rotten shit

327
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,442
you're gonna pull off the barn.

328
00:22:47,313 --> 00:22:49,489
You gonna get her to stop
or you want me to?

329
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:51,722
Donna, stop! We need...
we need this place intact.

330
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,812
For what? Huh?

331
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:55,781
We're all going home, right?

332
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:58,223
We don't need this place anymore.

333
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:01,391
Your glorious tower's
gonna get us all home.

334
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:04,856
No need to keep this place standing.

335
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:08,893
It's not a home anymore.
It's a fucking tomb!

336
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,204
The fuck!

337
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,535
Fuck!

338
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,325
Look, can we please...

339
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,393
Can we please just take
a minute and let's...

340
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,581
Fuck off!

341
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,050
Aw, fuck!

342
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,362
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

343
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,717
It was nice that Ellis came
to see you before you left.

344
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:06,485
I'm sure he appreciates
what you're doing.

345
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:11,934
I heard the story about what
happened with your wife,

346
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,562
what you had to do.

347
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:15,927
We're not gonna talk about that.

348
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:18,028
That's okay.

349
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:19,743
We don't have to. It's...

350
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,705
It's just, in some ways...

351
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,741
you remind me of Nathan.

352
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,657
I mean, you're a lot
more gruff than he was.

353
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:35,386
But you always put other
people's needs before your own.

354
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,784
That's how he ended up here.

355
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:40,468
I don't think he'd like
what we're doing now.

356
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:41,931
And why is that?

357
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:45,297
Nathan had a theory about this place.

358
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:49,466
If we tried to leave,
if we pushed too hard,

359
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:51,732
then something would push back.

360
00:24:57,938 --> 00:25:00,004
What is that?

361
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,317
I don't know.

362
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:19,155
Are you sure it was
coming from this direction?

363
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:23,500
Let's go.

364
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:39,219
I thought you said no one
had been out this far before.

365
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:43,014
No.

366
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:50,472
What are you doing?

367
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:53,189
Look, there's something inside them.

368
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:55,290
We gotta get one down.

369
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:56,467
Just, uh...

370
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,844
Are you sure that's a good idea?

371
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,241
Maybe we should...

372
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,145
Hey, what's wrong?

373
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:05,300
Ow!

374
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:07,170
Ow!

375
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:08,205
Whoa, Sara.

376
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,876
Ow!

377
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,813
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you're okay.

378
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:14,188
- You're okay.
- Ow!

379
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:15,431
Look at me, Sara. You're okay.

380
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:17,048
No! No!

381
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,665
Look... What's going on?

382
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:19,820
Sara! Sara!

383
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:23,362
I can hear them! I can...

384
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:24,737
No, no. Talk to me.

385
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,266
Talk to me. Talk to me.

386
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,740
No, no, no, no!

387
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:29,599
No! No!

388
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,206
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't, don't! No, no!

389
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,406
No. Sara? No, no, no. Okay.

390
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,636
No, Sara! Sara! Hey!

391
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:44,382
How's the magic tower coming?

392
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:52,226
You know, all the time I've been here,

393
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,117
this is first you've
set foot in this place.

394
00:26:57,464 --> 00:27:01,961
Because you serve piss water.
Your distilling is for shit.

395
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,162
At least here, I can be alone.

396
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:07,637
Oh.

397
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:09,551
Kinda feels like a banner day today.

398
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,872
Feel like I'm holding court.

399
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:14,270
You mind giving us a second?

400
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,910
Yeah.

401
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:19,451
I'll leave this here.

402
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:22,353
Give me a holler
if you need anything, okay?

403
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,956
Are you okay?

404
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:34,136
Donna, I know you're upset about Eric,

405
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,808
but there's nothing you could have...

406
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:38,499
Oh, for fuck's sake,
it's not about that.

407
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:43,838
Eric punched his own ticket.

408
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:48,139
Kid's got a right to
go out the way he wants.

409
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,493
Why don't you just
fuck off and leave me be.

410
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:54,618
Go back to your little fantasy land.

411
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:58,083
You don't think the tower's gonna work.

412
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:00,657
Do you?

413
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:05,354
I think it might.
I think it's worth trying.

414
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:07,456
And what happens when you fail?

415
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,502
Then we try again.

416
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:11,635
No!

417
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,330
No, ya stupid little shit.

418
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,937
That's the point. You don't try again,

419
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:19,269
because you got people's hopes up,

420
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,820
you made them believe.

421
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:23,444
You take that away now
and they're lost,

422
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:27,013
they give up,
and then they fucking die.

423
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:33,184
'Cause it isn't some
grade-school softball game

424
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:35,461
where everyone gets
a participation medal.

425
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:37,562
You don't know!

426
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:40,004
You don't remember
what it was like before

427
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:42,391
because you weren't here.

428
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:48,232
You wanna know what I'm grieving?

429
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:53,138
I'm grieving the loss of what
we almost made this place.

430
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:56,339
I'm grieving the fact that,
for a little while,

431
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:58,891
this place almost felt like
something that could work.

432
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:02,510
I am grieving the fact that
you guys are so caught up

433
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:05,491
in playing Mr. Fucking Wizard
that you can't see

434
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:08,415
what this place is
gonna become when you fail.

435
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:21,903
So, what are we supposed to do?

436
00:29:21,938 --> 00:29:23,872
What are we supposed to do?

437
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,687
Just sit here and not try to go home?

438
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,218
Live in a place where
those things come to hunt us

439
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:30,252
every single night?

440
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:33,178
Oh, God, the fuck...

441
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:34,850
Why not?

442
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,094
At least here,
the monsters have the decency

443
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,723
to show you what they are.

444
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,634
I know you guys from town
look at Colony House

445
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:54,364
and figure it's all just
drinking and fucking.

446
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,367
But it was more than that.

447
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:59,743
It was special.

448
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:04,143
All those people from
all those different places,

449
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,982
different lives,
everyone living together.

450
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:09,984
For all the fear

451
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,416
and all the
monsters-in-the-forest bullshit,

452
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:15,451
there was something,

453
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:17,629
there was a joy in that house.

454
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:24,262
For a little while, anyways.

455
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:27,771
And, like most things,
none of us appreciated it

456
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:31,582
nearly as much as we should
have, and now it's fucking gone.

457
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:40,718
I'm sorry.

458
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:45,514
Yeah.

459
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:46,955
Me, too.

460
00:30:56,164 --> 00:31:00,001
Look, I'm gonna put my game face

461
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:02,201
back on tomorrow,

462
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:05,303
and we'll give that tower a shot.

463
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:13,344
But you have to be prepared for
the fallout if it doesn't work.

464
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,654
And if it does work...

465
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,737
I think you'll find there's
more you're gonna miss

466
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:24,028
about this place than you thought.

467
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,374
That kinda day, huh?

468
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:50,183
Just ironing out a few wrinkles,
that's all.

469
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,228
Yeah.

470
00:31:51,252 --> 00:31:53,450
Where's Jade?

471
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:58,994
He's, uh... I don't know.

472
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:00,391
Okay?

473
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:02,559
Donna did a number on the floor.

474
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:04,230
Yeah.

475
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:07,401
She knows how to wield an axe,
I'll give her that.

476
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,409
Well, better get back to it.

477
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:21,918
So, we got that coil
for the CB that you needed,

478
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,294
and we should have enough
wire stripped for the cord.

479
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,450
That's great.

480
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:27,682
Is it?

481
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:30,388
Well, yeah. I mean, look,

482
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:33,138
I'm not gonna stand here and
pretend that it was a great day.

483
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:36,768
These are setbacks, nothing more.

484
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:39,210
Look, you got what we
need for the radio,

485
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:42,774
tower's almost finished,
and I'm gonna figure this out.

486
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:44,435
How?

487
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,877
Well, that I don't know.

488
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:50,752
But one thing you learn as an
engineer: there's always a way.

489
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,609
We will figure this out.

490
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:25,883
Hey.

491
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,580
Hey.

492
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:33,517
Are you okay?

493
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:39,193
Eric was a friend.

494
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:42,625
Oh God, I'm... I'm sorry.

495
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,327
I-I didn't know that
you guys were close.

496
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,204
He had celiac disease,

497
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,767
so he came to the clinic a lot.

498
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:56,474
He was always bloated and dehydrated.

499
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,784
I kept telling him
to stop eating bread.

500
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:02,810
But he always said things like,
"I'm already in shitsville,"

501
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:05,989
"now you want me to give up carbs?"

502
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:08,233
He just had this way
about him, you know?

503
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:12,061
He was one of the people that,
when I first got here, he...

504
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,161
just made it a lot easier.

505
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:23,171
And now he's gone, so...

506
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,840
Hey, Kristi...

507
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:37,020
Look, I know you've had
a hard time lately,

508
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:40,353
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody,

509
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:43,460
and you feel like it's
your responsibility now...

510
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:48,394
But I just need you
to promise me, okay?

511
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:53,036
If it falls apart, if you fall apart,

512
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:57,370
just promise me, you'll come to me,

513
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:59,405
you'll talk to me,

514
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,407
you'll let me help.

515
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:06,742
I promise you.

516
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:13,353
Hey, I promise you.

517
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:16,928
Come here. Come on.

518
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:24,793
It's okay.

519
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,216
People just don't
understand what it's like.

520
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,703
I mean, it's not like
you can take a nickel

521
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:37,278
and suddenly make it worth 10 cents!

522
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,160
Aw, it doesn't matter. You know why?

523
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:45,055
Because Jade is a genius.
Jade'll figure it out. You...

524
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,430
Let me tell you something,

525
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:48,971
you have no idea
how much pressure that is,

526
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:50,335
to be the one that everybody

527
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,394
just assumes can fix a...

528
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:56,297
an unfixable problem!

529
00:35:56,332 --> 00:35:59,630
Oh, and then...

530
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:01,742
then, you've got
Mr. Tea Cups sauntering in

531
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:06,769
with his big white horse
and his blue eyes and his,

532
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:11,147
"Oh, don't smoke weed, you degenerate."

533
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,821
Fine, fine. You know what? Fine.

534
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:16,790
You think you can fix this?
Go ahead! Fix it!

535
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:19,947
I'm just dying
to see how it's done. Ha!

536
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:23,203
You so much complain!

537
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:25,755
Complain, complain!

538
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,361
Stop complain!

539
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,825
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

540
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,696
You need electric?

541
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:35,303
Yeah.

542
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:52,485
The problem is you can't
plug anything in.

543
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,168
I mean, it'd be one thing
if it was just,

544
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:58,062
you know, like a pan we
could throw on the stove.

545
00:36:58,097 --> 00:36:59,789
God knows,

546
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:03,088
whatever's coming up through
those wires is still...

547
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,672
Holy shit. I know how to do it.

548
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,149
Hello?

549
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:22,647
We're down here!

550
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:26,849
Hi.

551
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:28,818
How did it go with the tower?

552
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:30,358
Uh, good.

553
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:32,404
I think things are really shaping up.

554
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:35,165
You're a pretty bad liar.

555
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,333
Thanks. I'll add that to the list.

556
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:40,731
It's gonna work.

557
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:47,606
The tower, it's gonna work.

558
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,916
What's got you feeling so optimistic?

559
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,512
I don't know.

560
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:55,097
I was just thinking about
something Ethan said.

561
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:57,121
What was that?

562
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,431
What if we were supposed to come here?

563
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:01,059
I don't know, it's weird, but...

564
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:05,019
back home, we never talked anymore.

565
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,295
We just...

566
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,759
And now, we're together again,

567
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,267
like, we're really together.

568
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:14,028
And it's...

569
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:16,151
it's like Fatima said to me
on my first night,

570
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:18,901
"If you climb up high enough,

571
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:20,947
even a nightmare can
look like a dream."

572
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:22,971
Wise words.

573
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:30,154
So, how about you forget about
your tower for a little while

574
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:32,167
and come help us dig our hole?

575
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:35,753
Deal.

576
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:06,113
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

577
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,490
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Come on.

578
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,594
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

579
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:16,178
There. There, there you go.

580
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:18,499
There you go.

581
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:20,401
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.

582
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,440
Where are we?

583
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,409
Don't worry. We're safe.

584
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:32,678
Is that...?

585
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,042
Oh, yeah.

586
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:37,848
I, uh...
finally managed to get one down,

587
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:41,555
and, uh... this was inside.

588
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:45,196
What does it say?

589
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:47,198
1864.

590
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,234
That's it.

591
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:53,402
And, from what I could tell,

592
00:39:53,437 --> 00:39:55,547
every bottle up there seems
to have a slip of paper

593
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,505
just like this.

594
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:00,307
I think we should go back.

595
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,644
What?

596
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,481
The voice I heard,

597
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:09,484
it was different this time.

598
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,015
It was a woman and...

599
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,182
and she was screaming.

600
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:16,953
She said...

601
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:21,925
She said that she was wrong,

602
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,896
that we shouldn't have come,
that there are things out here

603
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:28,569
that are worse than the monsters.

604
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:31,539
She kept saying...

605
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:33,706
What? She kept saying what?

606
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:36,577
I don't know.

607
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:39,844
It doesn't make any sense.

608
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,087
She kept saying,

609
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:43,254
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

610
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:44,915
that I was wrong."

611
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:49,854
What?

612
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,466
What is that?

613
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,632
I don't know.

614
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:16,298
What's happening?

615
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:17,948
I don't know.

616
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:35,801
There's drawings of scarecrows

617
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:37,836
and bogeymen, giant spiders.

618
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,168
This is definitely a quest.

619
00:41:45,142 --> 00:41:46,614
What is it?

620
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:48,462
Keep digging, keep digging!

621
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:50,123
I think I hit the bottom.

622
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:51,355
Oh, my God.

623
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,598
Here, here. Let me help.

624
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:54,424
Hey!

625
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:59,121
Get in!

626
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:07,536
Are you... are you...

627
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:21,814
Hey, where's the talisman?

628
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:27,149
W-where's the talisman?

629
00:42:27,184 --> 00:42:28,184
Here!

630
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,881
We shouldn't have come here.

631
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,300
Shh!

632
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:49,039
We're okay. We're okay.

633
00:42:49,074 --> 00:42:51,305
No.

634
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,274
I don't think we are.
