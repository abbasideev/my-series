1
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:25,646
Mom?

2
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:27,856
Mom?

3
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,065
Present.

4
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,317
What?

5
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,152
Like when the teacher
calls roll call,

6
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,239
you say "present." Mom is
ready, so reportin' to duty.

7
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:37,782
How come you only
have one sock on?

8
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,743
I couldn't find the other one.

9
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,871
You can't go to
school like that.

10
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,922
Mom, can Alisa come over
Friday for a sleepover again?

11
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,798
Yeah, if it's okay
with her mom, sure.

12
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,801
Sweetie, are we not
combing our hair now,

13
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,346
or is this just a new fashion
thing that they got by me?

14
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,806
- I combed it.
- Well,

15
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,017
maybe we have ourselves a
wind tunnel in the house.

16
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,478
Why don't you go back and
comb it again, please?

17
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,313
What kind of mother
will people think I am

18
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,899
if you are a mop-head and
your brother's half sockless?

19
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,277
Alisa said you worry too much
about what other people think.

20
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,488
Excuse me?

21
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,617
Alisa said that? Now
why would she say that?

22
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,830
<i>She's never said that to me.</i>

23
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,042
Well, she must have got it from
somebody, so that leaves Betty.

24
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,670
I've never heard Betty say that.

25
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,672
I know she doesn't like me.

26
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,050
- What are you talking about?
- I get a feelin'.

27
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,427
Betty adores you, Candy.

28
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,224
You think she'd be trusting you
to look after our kids if she...

29
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,897
The feeling you're
getting is just her usual

30
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,691
depression stuff.

31
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,360
Yeah, how is that goin'?

32
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,989
Well, much better, actually.

33
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,327
This Marriage Encounter
was really a miracle.

34
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,914
What exactly do they do there?

35
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,419
Well, mostly get us to talk
about our feelings and...

36
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,673
Well, they're big into writing
everything down in a notebook.

37
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,383
Sounds a little silly.

38
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,387
I know. That's what we thought
at first, too, but it...

39
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,471
It really works.

40
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,433
For the first time in
I don't know how long

41
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,559
we were

42
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,770
unflinchingly honest
with each other.

43
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,108
Exactly how unflinchingly
honest could you be, Allan?

44
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,696
Well, except for that.

45
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,366
And it was an issue for me.

46
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,204
Betty would bring up sex
and my lack of interest.

47
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,956
And I'd go quiet.

48
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,333
I couldn't exactly say I
was less interested in sex

49
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,128
because I was having it
with Candy Montgomery.

50
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,422
We finally opened
up to each other.

51
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,507
Well, that's good.

52
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,927
I'm glad. So...

53
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,097
where does that leave us?

54
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,935
Well, it doesn't necessarily
change the way I feel about you.

55
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,439
But I do feel strongly

56
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,322
that I should be giving my
full resources to my family.

57
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,243
And my relationship
with you is taking away

58
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,789
some of my emotional
availability and

59
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,043
energy and attention that I
could be directing towards

60
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,547
Betty and the kids.

61
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,551
So you don't wanna
see me anymore?

62
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,096
I don't know. Yeah.

63
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,725
They said an awful lot of
things at the Encounter but

64
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,187
they never said you couldn't

65
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,107
see someone else.

66
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:02,822
Allan, you seem to be leaving it
up to me, so I'm just deciding.

67
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm not gonna call. I'm
not gonna try to see you.

68
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,913
I won't bother you anymore.

69
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,876
Okay.

70
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,962
Ok... Wow.

71
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:22,507
Well, you certainly unleashed
your feelings there.

72
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,302
Well, I'm not sure how
you want me to respond.

73
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,305
Do you remember
what you told me?

74
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,475
That the days you spent
with me at the Como,

75
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,561
that they were the only
hours of your week where

76
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:37,106
you didn't feel responsible
for other people's emotions.

77
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,734
Meaning Betty. The burden
of making her happy.

78
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:46,282
The burden of keeping
her from being miserable.

79
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,283
Now,

80
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,286
have you ever

81
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,582
felt any responsibility
for my emotions?

82
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,626
Do you now?

83
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,509
Candy...

84
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,139
Yeah.

85
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:14,976
Okay.

86
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,599
You realize that every
time you feel a hole,

87
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,184
you paint the kitchen?

88
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,770
That's not true.

89
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,146
Okay, fine. Maybe
it's a little true,

90
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,191
but also, you know,
it is good therapy.

91
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,778
- Well, it looks really good.
- Thank you.

92
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,113
I keep saying that we should
start our own business.

93
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,283
There's a lot of people in Wylie that
are looking to remake their lives,

94
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,119
and some of which would settle
for a spiffier breakfast nook.

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,623
You know, it's not even
like I'm gonna miss the sex.

96
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,083
It's the friendship.

97
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,544
Allan's been like
my best friend.

98
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,671
Hello? What about me?

99
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,675
I just wish I could
talk like that with Pat.

100
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,386
Okay, I'm serious.

101
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,930
Why don't we start
our own business?

102
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,724
At a minimum, it'll get us out
into other people's kitchens.

103
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,435
That's where the real life
happens anyway, right? Kitchens?

104
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,604
God, I'm feelin' angry.

105
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,732
I don't necessarily want him but

106
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,735
I don't like feeling rejected.

107
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,281
You're gonna have to put that in
the fridge, honey, for it to keep.

108
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,657
Or the garage.

109
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:56,202
- The garage is nice and cool.
- Why does it have to stay cool?

110
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,329
The weather this warm,
I'm afraid it'll rot,

111
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,625
and we still have two whole
weeks before Halloween.

112
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,593
<i>I think it's just a
benign fibrous mass.</i>

113
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,305
You can't possibly know
that. Not for sure.

114
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,807
Betty, this is likely harmless.

115
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,851
How dare you be
impatient with me.

116
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,353
It could be cancer.

117
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,980
I don't think it is.

118
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,898
But you can't know that!

119
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,568
I actually can know it.

120
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,738
It's my business to know it.

121
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,531
And the mammogram confirms it.

122
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,074
So it's nothing?

123
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,495
It's a mass, yes.
But it's benign.

124
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,415
You should stop
taking birth control

125
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,292
and also control
your caffeine intake.

126
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,377
It could be from
drinking too much coffee?

127
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,881
Betty, you're fine.

128
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,842
Honey, I'm just saying

129
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,178
that you were Luke
Skywalker last year,

130
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,139
and there are other
characters in "Star Wars."

131
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,224
No, he wears a mask for
the other characters.

132
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,769
He gets claustrophobia.

133
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,687
- You puked in your Batman mask!
- Hey.

134
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,691
- No, I didn't!
- Alright! Okay!

135
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,907
Jenny! Wait your turn!

136
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,368
Okay!

137
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,119
Thank you. Thank you.

138
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,749
- Wait up!
- Ian, stop following me!

139
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,304
- Hello?
- <i>Hey!</i>

140
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,306
Candy?

141
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,184
Sorry. I know I promised
that, that I wouldn't call,

142
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,396
but this is just
for some advice.

143
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,482
I'm sorry. Bad manners.

144
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,067
How are you?

145
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,655
I'm good. Good. How are you?

146
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,198
You don't sound great.

147
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,119
Well, I said good, not great.

148
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,829
What's the matter?

149
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,833
<i>Betty found a lump
in her right breast.</i>

150
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,589
She's fine. At least that's what
the doctors are telling her.

151
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,591
She's already been to two.

152
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,385
I'm sure she's
looking for a third.

153
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,763
They think it's benign,
but she's a wreck.

154
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,059
Well, I should go over
there. Is she home now?

155
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,187
She is, but you don't have to.

156
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,483
No, I should go check
on her. If it were me...

157
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,235
<i>You're a good friend, Candy.</i>

158
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,962
- Betty.
- Hi!

159
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,965
Hi. I just heard

160
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,676
and I know in my heart

161
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,221
that you're fine.

162
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,640
Thank you.

163
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,099
Thank you so much.

164
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,269
You have nothin' to worry about.

165
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,981
- I hope you're right.
- Hey, now, you listen to me.

166
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,275
Doctors are so scared
today about bein' sued

167
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,070
that if you go to them
with a growth of any kind,

168
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,239
the last thing they're gonna do
is say, "Go home, it's nothin',"

169
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,035
unless they are pretty
damn sure it's nothin'.

170
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,622
I am sure that you're right.

171
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,624
How did you find out?

172
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,459
Allan told me.

173
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,461
- Allan did?
- Yeah, he was concerned.

174
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,589
You know how worried
husbands can get.

175
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,841
Oh, wait. No, I
got that wrong.

176
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,427
Husbands never worry enough.

177
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,138
That's it.

178
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,645
Well, you didn't have to
drive all the way down here.

179
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,982
But I cannot tell you how much
it means to me that you did.

180
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:40,945
These doctors, they think I
am the biggest hypochondriac!

181
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,780
They tell me it's nothing,
convince me it's all in my head,

182
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,658
then write me prescriptions
for anxiety and depression,

183
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,868
of which I'm on a gazillion.

184
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,121
- Hi, honey!
- Hi.

185
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,873
Can you believe Candy drove
all the way down here?

186
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,960
She is just the sweetest.

187
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,755
- You feeling better?
- Yes.

188
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,678
Yes. She helped lasso
my runaway brain.

189
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,266
Look at us making
you stand out here.

190
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,684
- Come in, come in.
- Oh, no! No, no, no.

191
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,688
I gotta get back and make
dinner. It's Meatball Tuesday.

192
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,692
This is just one of those hug-and-runs,
now that I see that you're fine.

193
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,570
- And you are.
- Yes.

194
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,822
Walk Candy to her car.

195
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,072
- Sure.
- Would you, sweetheart?

196
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,034
Thank you again.

197
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,952
So much.

198
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,455
And let's get the kids together

199
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,998
for some trick-or-treating.

200
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,043
Sure, yeah. Perfect.
I'll call you!

201
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Okay.

202
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,674
That is not the same person.

203
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,093
You're saying Marriage
Encounter did that?

204
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,929
I'm telling you, she's
like a flower blossoming.

205
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,515
Yeah, and she was actually warm.

206
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,727
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to...

207
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,520
Yes, you did.

208
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,649
But it's alright.
You're not wrong.

209
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,277
- But now, she's...
- Just like a normal person.

210
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,616
Hey, do you think that Pat and I
should get into Marriage Encounter?

211
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,910
'Cause that's actually
why I called earlier.

212
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,497
- Well, I'm not sure.
- Well, I gotta try somethin'.

213
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,500
He doesn't know
how to communicate.

214
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,462
The thing is Marriage Encounter
is definitely not for couples

215
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,965
who are having serious problems.

216
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,886
From what you told me about
your feelings for Pat...

217
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,890
I do love him.

218
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,059
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

219
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,396
But it really...
It worked for you.

220
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,606
So far.

221
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,982
So far, it's really worked.

222
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,777
She insists on doing the
homework every night.

223
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,489
The dialog sessions,
the love letters.

224
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,952
She wants to become a
group leader in the area.

225
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,163
Very committed.

226
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,750
- Well, that's good.
- But thank you for checking on her.

227
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,878
Yeah. It was good to see you.

228
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,424
Good to see you, too. Alright.

229
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,224
<i>My pleasure.</i>

230
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>You're all very special people.</i>

231
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,519
<i>Thank you. We're coming back.</i>

232
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,480
<i>Oh, well, in that case,
I'll double our insurance.</i>

233
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,281
<i>- Thanks for everything.
- Yes. Wonderful.</i>

234
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,408
<i>So long.</i>

235
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,534
<i>Well, what's your prediction?</i>

236
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,037
<i>Oh, definite marriage.</i>

237
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,622
<i>Think they'll have children?</i>

238
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,124
<i>Whether they want to or not.</i>

239
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,085
Hey.

240
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,670
I was watching that.

241
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,090
Yes, I can see that
you were watching that.

242
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,258
I bet you'd love to be a
passenger on <i>The Love Boat,</i>

243
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,594
wouldn't you, Pat?

244
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,388
Well, guess what? So would I.

245
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,852
I feel like I'm in trouble.

246
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,104
I don't know why.

247
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,107
I wanna go to
Marriage Encounter.

248
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,275
What?

249
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,904
It's not just the
Garlingtons. Allan and Betty.

250
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,949
Betty, I mean, she's just
like a whole new person.

251
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,284
It's a cult though, Candy.

252
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,412
It's not a cult!

253
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,498
And even if it is...

254
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,125
Why are we here, Pat?

255
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,546
And I don't mean
on the sofa. I mean

256
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,713
on Earth.

257
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,716
- Yeah.
- Why are we here?

258
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,847
That's a huge question, Candy.

259
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,809
And I'd like an
answer. Your answer.

260
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,854
Well, I mean

261
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,649
why is a tree here?

262
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,568
What?

263
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,862
You know how I hate you answering
my questions with questions.

264
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,989
- Yeah, I have...
- Why is a tree here?

265
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,491
- Seriously?
- Look, Candy.

266
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,703
I'm not going to have this

267
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,704
cosmic grasp

268
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,332
that you're looking
for, I think, but

269
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,335
a tree, it grows its roots.

270
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,589
It sprouts fruit.

271
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,176
The fruit spreads its seeds,
and then more trees grow,

272
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,845
and it goes on and on like that.

273
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,764
And I don't think we're
much different, you know?

274
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,685
We grow our roots.
We raise our kids.

275
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,480
I think that's a good
reason to be here.

276
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,357
Or anywhere.

277
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,568
Well, what's your answer?

278
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,988
Why are you here?

279
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,160
I don't know.

280
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,877
You know

281
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,088
you always want more.

282
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,966
You do, Candy.
Whatever you have,

283
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,676
- you always want more.
- Yes, I do.

284
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,887
I do want more.

285
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,931
And I'm not gonna
apologize for it.

286
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,685
I want more from me.
From you. From us.

287
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,314
You want to go to
Marriage Encounter?

288
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,904
Okay. Let's go.

289
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,246
So he has agreed, and we're
gonna just give it a try.

290
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,000
- This is great.
- Well, you know, it's hopeful,

291
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,504
and every day should have a
sprinkle of hope in it, so.

292
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,131
You should put that in one
of your Sunday parables.

293
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,716
"Every day should have
a sprinkle of hope."

294
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,759
That is lovely.

295
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,594
And you know what else?

296
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,429
And this could be
the best part of all.

297
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,640
Just that Pat is willing to try,

298
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,433
I don't find myself
thinking of Allan as much.

299
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,602
And when I do, the first
thing that comes to my mind

300
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,646
is that his eyes are
too close together.

301
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,649
That's what I've been sayin'.

302
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,859
Here's my new mantra.

303
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,947
It's called, "rediscover me."

304
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,200
With my marriage,
with our new business.

305
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,995
And I thought of the
perfect name already.

306
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,830
The Covergirls.

307
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,999
- The Covergirls.
- It's what we do, right?

308
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,335
I paint, you wallpaper.
The Covergirls.

309
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,212
I love it. "We
got you covered."

310
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,423
Yes.

311
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,886
And thank you, Sherry
girl, for covering me.

312
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,770
So that's 10 windows,
and price per.

313
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,232
Plus saving time on
construction, right?

314
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:24,783
Don Crowder! Church
grounds on a weekday?

315
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,411
My, my, whose wrath
have you doth incurred?

316
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,706
Just my normal pillar and
beacon of the community stuff.

317
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,875
Trying to figure out
some budget challenges.

318
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,545
Yeah, buildings and maintenance.
That's why I'm here.

319
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,464
Let's see.

320
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,341
What's this?

321
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,553
Now, if you're serious about
sprucing up the parsonage,

322
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,888
Sherry Cleckler
and I have started

323
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,474
a new little boutique
home improvement business.

324
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,933
It's mostly paint and polish,

325
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,852
but it's good work at
a price you won't beat.

326
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:52,895
Thank you.

327
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,147
I'll certainly consider it.

328
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,483
And references upon request.

329
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,069
Well, how would you have
references if you just started?

330
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,073
Why, Ron, I make 'em up.

331
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,202
I'll leave you to your
pillaring and beaconing.

332
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,332
You wanna get in tighter
with the congregation,

333
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,293
straightest line might
be Candy Montgomery.

334
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,796
Folks love her.

335
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,216
Yeah. Meaning they
don't love me.

336
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,220
Ron, a little friendly advice.

337
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,182
Here at Lucas,

338
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,392
people just wanna
raise their kids,

339
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,019
love their family, love God.

340
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,105
Doesn't call for heavy
lifting on your part.

341
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,149
Just don't be a dick.

342
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,914
Okay.

343
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,834
Is that a moose?

344
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,045
Yep.

345
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,548
- Should we go check in?
- Okay.

346
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:09,264
When you give yourself, and I
mean give all of yourselves,

347
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,142
I'm gonna make it real simple.

348
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,811
When you give,

349
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,814
you beget.

350
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,276
Let's say it all
together, shall we?

351
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:26,447
When you give, you beget.

352
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,907
Well done.

353
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,871
And look inside. How
does that make you feel?

354
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,667
Pat?

355
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,547
Should I read yours first?

356
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,884
- Okay. Yeah. Yes.
- Okay.

357
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,430
- "When I think of you..."
- Now, I'm a mathematician,

358
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,267
not a writer. So.

359
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,268
Okay.

360
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,816
"When I think of you,
I feel the earth move."

361
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,611
That is so sweet.

362
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,614
"I feel it under my feet."

363
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,824
Pat.

364
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,411
"I feel the sky tumbling down."

365
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,711
Pat, this is a Carole King song.

366
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,423
She's one of your favorites.

367
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,217
Honey, I told you
I'm not a writer.

368
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,427
- Oh, my God!
- They're good words.

369
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,262
No, but they're not your words!

370
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,807
Words are not my thing!

371
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,935
I love you more than
I could ever express.

372
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,562
More than I could ever write
down in some stupid notebook,

373
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,274
at some stupid cult workshop.

374
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,820
I went with Carole King

375
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,282
because you said she always
wrote close to your heart,

376
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,576
and that's where I wanna be.

377
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,287
Close to your heart.

378
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,042
Why couldn't you have put that
down? That was really beautiful.

379
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,670
It was?

380
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:06,588
Yes.

381
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,847
I wanna be close
to your heart, too.

382
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,685
Why are we here, Candy?

383
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,814
I don't mean on Earth,
I mean at this place,

384
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,316
and

385
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,276
I...

386
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,697
I don't know what
you're looking for.

387
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,158
Do you know what
you're looking for?

388
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,039
The song "Tapestry"
by Carole King.

389
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,167
I've listened to
it a zillion times,

390
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:51,050
and I still have no idea what it's
about, but it speaks to me just the same.

391
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:57,557
"My life has been a tapestry
of rich and royal hue.

392
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,186
A wondrous woven magic."

393
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,818
Now, I haven't a clue what
she's talkin' about...

394
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,739
But I want it.

395
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,077
Yeah, I want it. I want

396
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,497
my royal hue.

397
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,918
Oh, honey.

398
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:27,879
Pat.

399
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,929
<i>I'm not saying that it
wasn't a little goofy</i>

400
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,556
but, you know, we did connect.

401
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,016
That's fantastic.

402
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,226
Yeah. And we've fallen
off with the assignments.

403
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,646
There's the daily
10-and-10 and so forth.

404
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,357
What's the daily 10-and-10?

405
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,693
Well, you pick a topic, and you
write about it for 10 minutes,

406
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,821
and then you spend another
10 minutes talking about it.

407
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,283
We did do that for
about three days.

408
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,662
But overall, you know, our sex
life has definitely improved.

409
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,665
And I hardly ever think about

410
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,502
you-know-who's
perfectly shaped penis.

411
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:12,048
- Well, this is all very positive.
- Yeah, I think so.

412
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,386
Sorry.

413
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,766
- Hello?
- <i>Candy. Betty Gore.</i>

414
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,394
Betty, hi! How are you?

415
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,062
I'm fine.

416
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,691
And I'm told that you are.
Marriage Encounter went well?

417
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,860
I think it did, yes.

418
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,278
<i>That is so good.</i>

419
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,031
You know I'm the
local Flame leader.

420
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,699
<i>I think I heard that.</i>

421
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,202
Yes, that's fantastic.

422
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,122
<i>Yeah. One of my duties</i>

423
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,082
is I host other couples

424
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,251
who have been Encountered and,

425
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:52,755
well, I would love to have
you and Pat over on Saturday.

426
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,382
She wants me to come to dinner.

427
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,259
No.

428
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,928
And you said yes?

429
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,222
<i>Well, I felt on the spot.</i>

430
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,142
Well, it's this Saturday?

431
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,936
Yep. What are we gonna do?

432
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,022
I guess it'll be fine.

433
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,483
Will it be a problem for you?

434
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,570
I don't know. It might be.

435
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,241
To see you in that context
might be painful and

436
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,828
I don't know. What if I
start wanting you again?

437
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:33,712
I'm so sorry, Candy. I feel so guilty
for messing up your life like this.

438
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,507
No, no. You didn't. Maybe...

439
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,344
Maybe this is just the
best way for us to move on.

440
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,721
Because Betty and I,
we should be friends

441
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:46,559
and maybe this will be
kinda like a good closure.

442
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:50,313
Yeah. Good. Okay, good. Good.

443
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,692
It'll be great. I
think it'll be fine.

444
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,028
The best part is the
capsule will be reusable.

445
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,530
So, I mean, you think of
all the wasted technology...

446
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,534
- What a waste.
- Such a waste.

447
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,624
- This looks delicious.
- So delicious.

448
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,251
You know, pot roast
is my favorite.

449
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,921
Well, I did know.

450
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,673
Allan let the cat
out of the bag.

451
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,345
It didn't take you
two scientists long

452
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,890
to start talking about
rocket ships and so forth.

453
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:32,437
No, but actually, we were talking about
something new called the space shuttle.

454
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,441
Which is a capsule which can
be used for repeated travel.

455
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,570
What did you say, Pat?
A couple of years?

456
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,155
1981. Yeah.

457
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,617
Pretty soon, it'll be easier
to go to the moon and Mars

458
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,370
than to get in
and out of Dallas.

459
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,629
So, you two enjoyed, you
enjoyed the Encounter.

460
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:58,964
Yeah.

461
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,092
You been keeping up
with your 10-and-10?

462
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,510
Well, we're trying.

463
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,803
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

464
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:08,473
Well, that's wonderful.
Isn't that wonderful?

465
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,101
It's wonderful. Yeah.

466
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,645
Yeah.

467
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,277
Candy, I heard about
you and Sherry Cleckler

468
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,280
are talking about a

469
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,992
rediscovering yourself. A
kind of a "rediscover you."

470
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,077
- Wait, did I hear that correctly?
- Yes, you did.

471
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,662
And what does that entail?

472
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,415
Well, Sherry and I are
starting a business together.

473
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,500
Home improvement.

474
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,881
And then, I'm still taking
my writers' workshop classes.

475
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,217
I'm actually moving on
to an advanced level.

476
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,469
That's wonderful.

477
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:49,849
Some kind of wonderful.

478
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,186
You know

479
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,149
sometimes, the best way to
rediscover yourself is to

480
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,485
look inside you.

481
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,531
Deep inside.

482
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,034
That makes sense.

483
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,037
We all have stuff

484
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,832
buried deep within.

485
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,918
Things we never knew were there.

486
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,633
Yep.

487
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,015
Wonderful.

488
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,271
My God, you must have
been dyin' inside!

489
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,107
- A little, but mostly, I was just bored.
- Bored?

490
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,653
At a couples dinner with your
lover, his wife, and your husband?

491
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,738
He is not my lover anymore.

492
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:50,492
And you know what? The best
part is I was bored with him.

493
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,910
Allan.

494
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:55,664
I thought that it would be hard to see
him or that old feelings would bubble up,

495
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,041
but nothin'. It's over.

496
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:01,002
And Betty, love her to death,
but she's a little weird.

497
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,129
You're just now
figurin' that out?

498
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,257
But she's also nice. You know,
she's odd because she's odd,

499
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,469
not because she's mean
or unkind or uncaring.

500
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,513
And I'll tell you
somethin' else.

501
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,015
I think she's way more
interesting than Allan.

502
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,810
Why does she have to go to
some lake to study the Bible?

503
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,604
- She could just study it here.
- Yep.

504
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,607
Yeah, we have a lot of Bibles.

505
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,945
Maybe she's really
going fishing.

506
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:27,863
Nope.

507
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,739
No, she's definitely studying.

508
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,992
Your mother is taking
some special time

509
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:36,414
to further her commitment to our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

510
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,998
And I'm very proud of her.

511
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,834
I think you guys should
be proud of her, too.

512
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,460
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

513
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,713
Okay.

514
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,339
It's time for us to pray, right?

515
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,427
- Can we talk after?
- Yeah. Yeah, you can talk after.

516
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,681
Now I lay me down to sleep. I
pray the Lord my soul to keep.

517
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:59,061
And if I die before I wake, I
pray to God my soul to take.

518
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,225
- Hey, Pat.
- Hey.

519
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,810
Can I talk to you for a sec?

520
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,270
It's important.

521
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,522
Sure.

522
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,482
You can just let that dry.

523
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,236
- Hey. Yeah. Sorry.
- Hi. It's okay.

524
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,029
Alright.

525
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,412
So

526
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:29,003
I found a love letter
from Allan Gore to Candy.

527
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,882
I was looking for a letter she'd
written me just after we married

528
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:37,094
and found a different letter.

529
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,390
I need to know something.
I know she would tell you.

530
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,268
Is it over?

531
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,981
- Pat...
- Is it over?

532
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:56,906
It is.

533
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,366
And it won't happen again.

534
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,327
It was just a brief
thing and, honestly,

535
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,330
it was more friendship
than anything.

536
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,373
It was just a stage
that Candy went through.

537
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,251
We were just over at
their house not long ago.

538
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,254
- The Gores, all four of us...
- She told me, and you know what she said?

539
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,507
She said the best part about that night
was that she felt nothin' for Allan.

540
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,052
That it's over-over.

541
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,597
Pat.

542
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,849
She really loves you.

543
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:30,188
Candy is a good mother,
and she's a good wife,

544
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,981
and she is a good friend to you.

545
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,317
She just made a mistake.

546
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:38,280
And it was just a brief thing
and it didn't mean anything.

547
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,409
And it's totally over?

548
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,789
It's been over for a long time.

549
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,879
I wanna talk to Candy
about this in my own way.

550
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,257
I don't want you to tell
her that I talked to you.

551
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,220
- Promise me I can talk to her first.
- I promise.

552
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,806
I promise.

553
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,758
- Mommy!
- Hey.

554
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,429
- Hey, baby! Hi!
- Hey, Mom!

555
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:47,181
Hi! Oh, my gosh, you grew!

556
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,352
I thought we had a deal.
No growing when I'm gone.

557
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,441
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey, Mom.

558
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,277
- Good trip?
- Oh, yeah.

559
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,195
Yeah, we learned so much.

560
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:04,033
I better not be hearing that
you grew, too, young lady.

561
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,908
Hello?

562
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,368
<i>It's me.</i>

563
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,372
<i>- Don't change your expression.</i>
- What?

564
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,002
Pat found Allan's letter.

565
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,004
What?

566
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,966
<i>He found one of Allan's love letters,
and he came by the salon this morning</i>

567
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,093
<i>to make sure that the
affair's really over.</i>

568
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,763
<i>And he made me promise not
to tell you that he knows.</i>

569
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:30,017
So, this is me not
telling you that he knows.

570
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,312
Well, I'll call you later, okay?

571
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:37,066
- <i>Okay. I'm so sorry.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

572
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,832
Everything alright?

573
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,252
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, it's good.

574
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,506
I think I should
start fixin' dinner.

575
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,259
And since I have been
gone, it is kids' choice.

576
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,512
- Chef Boyardee!
- Chef Boyardee!

577
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,389
That is my best work.
Straight out of a can.

578
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,892
Raise your hand if you
love Chef Boyardee's.

579
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:13,935
I do.

580
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,897
Chef Boiardi is the French
version of Chef Boyardee.

581
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,402
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

582
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,742
<i>Now, Travis, let him tell his
story the way he wants to.</i>

583
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,995
<i>But, Mama, I just seen that
old yeller dog catch this fish!</i>

584
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,957
<i>Arliss is just a little
boy with a big imagination.</i>

585
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,334
<i>Won't hurt him to
let him use it.</i>

586
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,462
<i>We keep that old
yeller dog much longer,</i>

587
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,423
<i>it's gonna make Arliss
the biggest liar in Texas!</i>

588
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,444
I know I failed you.

589
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,910
I tried to write down
how I feel in a letter.

590
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,915
I'm gonna go downstairs
while you read it.

591
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,586
Come down whenever
you feel like it.

592
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,278
<i>- Take it, Tom!
- No.</i>

593
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,832
<i>It just stands right
up. It's American...</i>

594
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,835
<i>I agree, agree! It felt...</i>

595
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,224
<i>You read the book? Right?
Did you read the book?</i>

596
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,184
<i>Yes, I read the book.</i>

597
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:00,936
<i>Okay, then you read the
Folk Singers' Credo.</i>

598
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:37,347
I am so ashamed.

599
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,313
I don't ever wanna
hurt you or the kids.

600
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:46,857
I know.

601
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:53,322
Maybe we could get away together.
South Padre Island for a bit.

602
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:57,492
Just you and me.
Could make it like a

603
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,496
second honeymoon.

604
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,834
That would be nice.

605
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:33,045
I trust you'll agree that the
added expenditure is well worth it.

606
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:36,132
They really are the most beautiful
rose-colored cushions I've ever seen, Ron.

607
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,676
They really do make a
wonderful statement.

608
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,970
We'll have the best
pews in the county.

609
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:43,557
Now, if we could just find
some folks to fill 'em.

610
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:50,271
Maybe we should just
invite Jackie Ponder back

611
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:51,939
to give a guest sermon.

612
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,525
That would fill the
seats, wouldn't it?

613
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,652
I think you're being a
little sensitive, Ron.

614
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:59,197
No! I'm not.

615
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:07,246
He's feeling sensitive
about the attrition.

616
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:10,541
Maybe if we can get the Gores
back, and the Garlingtons.

617
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,044
Y'all are friends
with the Gores, right?

618
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:17,339
No, not so much. No. Just
our kids play together.

619
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,593
You and Allan are in
the same line of work.

620
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:24,431
We don't need the Gores.

621
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:57,379
<i>Pryor remained in critical
but stable condition today</i>

622
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,549
<i>at the Sherman Oaks Community
Hospital in California.</i>

623
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:02,176
<i>Pryor continues his
steady improvement.</i>

624
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:06,055
<i>Surgery to remove scorched dead
skin could begin next Tuesday,</i>

625
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:08,224
<i>with skin grafting starting
three or four days later.</i>

626
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,768
Honestly, Pat, can
we not have that on?

627
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,812
- He was doing drugs, they say. Cocaine.
- Well, even so,

628
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,272
this is a day of celebration.

629
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:20,444
We shouldn't be hearin' talk of
comedians lightin' themselves on fire.

630
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,531
Dad, did you take
my elephant puppet?

631
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,491
- Why would I do that?
- He's missing.

632
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,285
And Noah's ark has
to have an elephant.

633
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,789
We'll find him, honey. Now, can
you please just eat your cereal?

634
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,502
And a cleaner shirt will be nice.
Could somebody call the girls?

635
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,879
- Why are you using that voice?
- What voice?

636
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,589
Your stressed voice.

637
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,258
This is my
zillion-things-to-do voice.

638
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:43,884
We have Bible camp graduation,

639
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,636
I have to do my parable,
we have the puppet show,

640
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:49,139
and then I have five different errands
to run in five different towns.

641
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,392
Hey! No, you don't.

642
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,726
- Three Trees?
- What?

643
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,395
Your parable. Are you
going with Three Trees?

644
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,690
Well, yeah. Do you
think I shouldn't?

645
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,941
No, well, it's my favorite.

646
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:00,693
Kids'll love it.

647
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:04,072
Mom, can Alisa go to the
movies with us tonight?

648
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,283
I don't know, honey.
Alisa's mom didn't like it

649
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:09,577
when we took her
to see "Grease."

650
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:13,289
But she loves "Star
Wars." She wouldn't mind.

651
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,000
She would want me to go.

652
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,750
Oh, sweetheart.

653
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,003
Now, that was just the
most adorable little fib,

654
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:21,880
but if it is okay with your mom,

655
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,882
we would love to have you.

656
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,343
Pat, are you sure you
can't make the puppet show?

657
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,764
'Cause I saw the rehearsal
and it's gonna be great.

658
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,058
- I wish.
- Okay.

659
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:38,565
Doesn't that serve
you perfectly right?

660
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,987
You can't come back here first?

661
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:49,909
My flight's at 4:00, honey.
So, with Friday traffic,

662
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:52,911
I think I probably need
to leave for the airport.

663
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,915
Best to just go straight
from the office.

664
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,836
- Just two days, honey. Two days.
- Yes.

665
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,840
Two days can go more quickly
for some than for others.

666
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,306
Then, I'm home, and

667
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,353
we're packing for Switzerland and
we're going to have the best time.

668
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,318
I'm almost two weeks late.

669
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,783
I can't take care of
another baby. I'll break.

670
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,580
- I don't wanna be pregnant again.
- Honey, there's no reason to start...

671
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:37,957
No, please don't...

672
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,628
Do not handle me.
I beg you. Just...

673
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,423
be with me.

674
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:48,927
Honey, I am. I am with you.

675
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,971
If you are,

676
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,723
we'll deal with it.

677
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,350
We can deal with anything.

678
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,144
Right? We can.

679
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,272
We can.

680
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:20,458
You wanna say bye?

681
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:25,463
Bye, Dada. Bye, Daddy. Bye.

682
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,134
Bye, Dada.

683
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:40,812
<i>"Once upon a time, there were
three trees high up on a hill.</i>

684
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,189
<i>"The biggest tree used
to say to the others,</i>

"'This tree looks like it would
make a fine fishing boat.'

691
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,629
"And the big tree
cried and cried,

692
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,673
"but the wood cutters
cut it down anyway,

693
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,633
"and it became the very boat

694
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,513
that Peter used as his altar
to spread the good news."

695
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,556
Isn't this a wonderful
time we're having?

696
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:19,976
- Yeah!
- Yes?

697
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,754
Hey, Barbara. Let me help
you. I can get the Kool-Aid.

698
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:50,631
It is gonna be a scorcher today.

699
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:54,009
Oh, my God, I just wanna
drop and put my feet up.

700
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,762
- Do you ever do that, Candy?
- Well, it won't be today.

701
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:59,348
The kids all wanna see
the new "Star Wars."

702
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:01,767
And Jenny wants Alisa to
stay over another night,

703
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,937
which is fine, but Alisa
has her swim lesson today,

704
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,688
so that means I have to
drive all the way to Wylie

705
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,274
to pick up her swimsuit.

706
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,820
I suppose if I do leave soon enough,
then I can swing by the Target

707
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,739
- to get a Father's Day card for Pat.
- Oh my... Go.

708
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,075
Go. I can do this.

709
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,159
And you better get a move on

710
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,369
if you're gonna make it back
in time for the puppet show.

711
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,787
And I can't miss that.

712
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,790
- Ian made the elephant.
- Bail.

713
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,627
- Hey. Listen to Miss Barbara, okay?
- Okay. Bye, Mom.

714
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:32,257
Hi!

715
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:33,675
Hi.

716
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,349
Candy! I finished with
your cassette recorder.

717
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,183
Okay, well, I'll be right back.

718
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,269
I just need to run over to
Betty Gore's and then to Target.

719
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,687
Gotcha. Bye.

720
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:48,189
Yeah. See you.

721
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:49,125
Candy.

722
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:51,419
Sorry. Why call when you
can barge right in, right?

723
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,545
I hope I didn't disturb.

724
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,590
No. No, no, no. No,
I just put the...

725
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,800
Put the baby down and then
poured myself a cup of coffee,

726
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:02,179
getting ready to watch
a little "Phil Donahue."

727
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,181
Sounds like heaven.

728
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,184
- Come in. Join me.
- Okay.

729
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:08,810
Well, I can't stay long.

730
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,355
Noah's ark is leaving
port within the hour.

731
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,690
But the reason I came is we're
seeing "Star Wars" tonight,

732
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,692
and Alisa wants to come,

733
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,195
and Jenny's just
desperate for her to join.

734
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,906
And I said it was okay with
me if it was okay with you.

735
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:23,076
Which is to mean her
spending another night.

736
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,205
And I'm happy to take her to her
swim lesson to save you the trip.

737
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,208
No, sure. That's fine with me.

738
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,918
Well, I thought it would be,

739
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,921
so I just came from Bible
school to pick up her suit.

740
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,203
- You sure you can't stay for coffee?
- No, no. Thank you.

741
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:42,970
Remember, she doesn't like to
put her face underwater. Alisa.

742
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:44,346
So, if she does put
her face underwater,

743
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:45,847
be sure to give her
peppermints afterwards.

744
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:48,059
That's the reward that we have.

745
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:50,687
- Okay!
- Okay.

746
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,732
I'm just so busy getting
ready for our trip.

747
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,360
- Switzerland! I heard!
- Kansas first.

748
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,738
We're gonna drop the kids and
the dogs off at my parents.

749
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,781
- Dogs?
- Yes.

750
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:04,533
We got another one. A
puppy, six months old.

751
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:06,660
He's right out there.

752
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:09,913
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

753
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:13,000
What is his name?

754
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:15,585
- Cheeto.
- Cheeto!

755
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,505
Oh, my gosh. Your
name is Cheeto. Hi.

756
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,507
Alisa can't bear
to leave him alone.

757
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:25,096
Well, I can see why. You're
just the sweetest little boy!

758
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:28,432
You're a good boy! Yes, you are!

759
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:30,351
Come, come. Just
sit for a second.

760
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,603
Okay.

761
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,357
- Okay, outside. Outside. Good job.
- Oh, my goodness.

762
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,413
- Nothing?
- No. Thanks.

763
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:52,749
Well.

764
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,425
Gonna be a scorcher today.

765
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,428
Scorcher.

766
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,223
I almost forgot. Sherry and
I actually incorporated.

767
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,975
We're lining jobs
up for the fall,

768
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:17,022
so if you need any papering or
painting done, here is our card.

769
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,816
The Covergirls.

770
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:22,445
- It's cute.
- It's so exciting.

771
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,030
Well, I should
probably get goin'.

772
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:29,785
I'm hopin' to swing by Target and
get a Father's Day card for Pat,

773
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:31,828
so should I just go
grab Alisa's suit or...

774
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,829
Candy.

775
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,376
Are you having an
affair with Allan?

776
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,212
No.

777
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:42,340
No, of course not.

778
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,802
But you did.

779
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:49,138
Didn't you?

780
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,268
Didn't you?

781
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,274
Yes.

782
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,238
But it was a long time ago.

783
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,831
Did Allan tell you?

784
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,381
Can you wait a minute?

785
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,050
Betty?

786
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,348
Betty.
