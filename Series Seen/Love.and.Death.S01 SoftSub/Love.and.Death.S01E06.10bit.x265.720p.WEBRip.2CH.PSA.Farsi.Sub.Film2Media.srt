on a business trip.

353
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,565
And that would
always unsettle her.

354
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,610
-(Candy sighs deeply) -Unsettled.
Agitated. Was she depressed?

355
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,403
Perhaps.

356
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,072
She'd battled depression before.

357
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,284
She had some postpartum.
Plus, as I said,

358
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,244
when I would... When
I would travel...

359
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,454
Don: And on the
morning of June 13th,

360
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,182
did she seem agitated or
depressed over anything,

361
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,209
besides your goin' away
on a business trip?

362
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,711
Yes, she...

363
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,340
She thought she
might be pregnant.

364
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,343

state of mind that day.

367
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,060
So much so that,
as you testified,

368
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,104
you made repeated calls

369
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,164
to check on her.
From the airport,

370
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,274
your hotel. You
repeatedly called.

371
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,485

372
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,945
on the night of
your wife's death,

373
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,423
when you called the
Montgomery house,

374
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,701
did you tell Mrs. Montgomery
that you were very concerned

375
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,912
that your wife had
committed suicide?

376

entered my mind. Yes.

dark thoughts, your wife.

390

wanna harm your wife?

We became very good friends.

This was not any torrid
love thing, was it?

399

away from your families?

401

- Don: Never talked about gettin' divorced from your spouses?

402
