1
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:44,832
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

2
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,070
Pat, I swear, your voice just
seems to get better and better.

3
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,740
You sure you didn't go to
Juilliard or something?

4
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,951
I did use to have a
friend named Julie

5
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,955
when I was a kid, and
we did play in her yard.

6
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,873
Sometimes we would sing.

7
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,334
Oh, my God! Patrick
Montgomery, I swear,

8
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,670
if there was an Olympic
competition for dorky jokes,

9
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,338
I'd be married to
a gold medalist.

10
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,674
Your voice has gotten better.

11
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,592
Well, how about me? I
sing like a swallow.

12
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,054
No need to get competitive.

13
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,724
Life is a competition,
don't they say?

14
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,143
Don't you like to say
that, Pastor Jackie?

15
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,812
Never. I don't believe
I ever even thought it.

16
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,314
We should all be
thinking about it

17
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,675
if we're serious about winning
the church volleyball league.

18
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,697
And maybe we should consider opening
our doors to the Congregationalists.

19
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,867
Don Awrey is 6'5" and
spikes like a madman.

20
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,035
He is great.

21
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,162
Well, you know, I dated
a Congregationalist once,

22
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,540
and he insisted on prayin'
before goin' car parking.

23
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,834
No, wait! No, he's Episcopalian!

24
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:54,962
What about you, Don?

25
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,796
Are you ever gonna
join the team?

26
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,591
- Volleyball's not my thing.
- Not enough mayhem.

27
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,072
He gravitates towards viciousness.
That's why he went into law.

28
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,096
Didn't you play
professional football?

29
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,223
- For the Washington Redskins.
- Yes!

30
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,601
Nah, I tried out, I
didn't make the team.

31
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:11,812
And it kills him to this day.

32
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,065
I'm gonna go get
some potato salad.

33
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,192
I'll race you.

34
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,986
We should really get going
soon because the chart says

35
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,239
that I'm going to reach peak
fertility around 1:00 PM

36
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,116
today, so.

37
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,243
Oh, right.

38
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,872
Little bit slower.

39
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,333
Little bit slower!

40
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,588
And be sure to emit as
you propulse forward.

41
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,300
- Evidently, that's helpful.
- Really?

42
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,178
- Here. Try to go deeper.
- I'm going as deep as I can, Betty.

43
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,639
No, you have been deeper before.

44
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,685
If you can squirt rather
than drip, that helps, too.

45
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,271
But, slower.

46
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,481
Deeper!

47
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,525
And squirt!

48
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,044
- Keep going, honey. You're doing great.
- Do I have to sing it?

49
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,171
Yes.

50
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,551
If you wanna keep filling that sweet
little heart of yours up with joy!

51
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,145
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

52
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,437
- Come in!
- All right.

53
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,940
<i>And why do I have the pleasure</i>

54
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,945
of a house call from
my favorite pastor?

55
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:44,822
Well.

56
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,409
It's not exactly pleasure,
I'm afraid. And...

57
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,328
I might stop being
your favorite pastor.

58
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,500
What's goin' on?

59
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,336
Bill's gone.

60
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,006
He wants a divorce.

61
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,677
It's been comin'
for a long time.

62
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,679
I know that you've
been struggling some.

63
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,931
Sweetie, sing louder.

64
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:15,977
That's good.

65
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,316
You will get through this. I
will drag you through this.

66
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,194
- I'm scared. I'll admit it.
- What about?

67
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,780
For starters, how will
I lead the congregation?

68
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,993
You're gonna lead us the
same as you always have.

69
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,455
And being single, after
23 years of marriage.

70
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:40,210
I'm not sure I even know how to
put one foot in front of the other.

71
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:45,049
So you just need to look
at this as a new beginning.

72
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,928
A new destiny.

73
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,307
- It's not fair.
- It's my job, Betty.

74
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,685
The whole point of that new job was
that you wouldn't have to travel.

75
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,730
As much. And I don't.

76
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,066
Well, it's not normal for a
husband and wife to be apart.

77
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,109
That's all I'm saying.

78
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,278
Right, but we're talking
about four days here.

79
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,449
Four critical days
during peak fertility.

80
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,790
Didn't the doctors say that you might
get pregnant easier if you stress less?

81
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,418
- So it's my fault.
- I didn't say that.

82
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,588
- Of course, you did. You did.
- No, I didn't.

83
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,219
And you might consider that it's your
traveling that's causing my stress.

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,322
Okay.

85
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:56,035
So, the thing is,
Jackie, our minister,

86
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,788
she's not just out of
town on church business.

87
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,749
She chose not to be here today.

88
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,751
Because I'm on the
church council,

89
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,756
she felt it better that
I break the news first.

90
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,719
Jackie and her husband
Bill are getting a divorce.

91
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,472
It happens.

92
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,810
Get over it. Pastors are
people like everybody else.

93
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,730
I see some of you
squirming in your seats,

94
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,816
like you suddenly got
pine cones up your butts.

95
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,736
Well, I tell you, if you ever did
get a pine cone up your keister,

96
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,071
you'd be squealing like a pig.

97
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,035
And Jackie Ponder would be the
first one runnin' to your aid.

98
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,912
So let's run to hers.

99
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,709
Not the time to be
high-horse, moral dopes.

100
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:49,464
Let's just get on with
being good Methodists.

101
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,257
We can start tonight

102
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,802
by kicking some Lutheran
butts at volleyball.

103
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,558
I got it!

104
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,358
Betty, hey. Hi.

105
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,985
Thought you'd be
playing tonight.

106
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,613
Sitting this one out.

107
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,034
Understood.

108
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,286
Yeah. Makes sense.

109
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,287
I got it!

110
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,375
- What makes sense?
- What?

111
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,377
My sitting this game
out makes sense.

112
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:30,339
- Why does it make sense?
- Well, if you are expecting,

113
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,092
it makes sense that
you'd steer clear of any

114
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,219
intense physical activity.

115
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,013
What makes you
think I'm expecting?

116
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,143
No, no, I'm sorry.

117
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,104
I just heard you and
Allan were trying.

118
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,731
I...

119
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,276
I apologize. I overstepped.

120
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,637
- Betty, I'm really sorry.
- It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

121
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,495
You really do have a
wonderful singing voice.

122
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,331
Thank you. Thank you.

123
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,211
Got it, got it, got it!

124
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,839
Are you okay?

125
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,466
I'm fine. I'm fine.

126
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,886
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

127
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,597
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

128
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,975
- Good. Okay.
- You don't wanna sit for a bit?

129
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,769
No, I'm fine, Allan.
I'm fine, thank you.

130
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,479
- Alright.
- Thanks.

131
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,023
Sorry. I gotta communicate.

132
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,752
What do you mean he
smelled like sex?

133
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,380
I mean he smelled like sex.

134
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,552
- Are we talkin' about the same Allan Gore?
- Oh yeah. I know.

135
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,682
I know, but how a man looks and smells
can be two totally different things.

136
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,518
And plus.

137
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,395
Plus what?

138
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,106
Well, I was kind of

139
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,484
gettin' the sense that he was
likin' the smell of me, too.

140
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,125
Like it could maybe
go in that direction.

141
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,987
What direction?

142
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,200
- I'm not sayin' that I would ever...
- Candy!

143
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,708
It's just this whole
thing with Jackie.

144
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,713
Maybe it's just kind
of opened up a can.

145
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,841
What can?

146
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,679
The "content is not all
it's cracked up to be" can.

147
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,349
You know, my father,
he used to say to me,

148
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,728
"Candy, if you ain't
growing, you're dying."

149
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,271
And he would also say,

150
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,274
"If you ain't searching

151
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,945
you're lost."

152
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,074
Allan Gore?

153
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,411
I mean, he'd be
"fall-in-love-proof," anyway.

154
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
Just take a look at him.

155
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,291
Who could be more
"fall-in-love-proof" than that?

156
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,036
Gary, would you like
to share your poem?

157
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,330
Okay. It's short.

158
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,708
That's fine. Some of my
favorite poems are short.

159
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,669
Haikus are quite
wonderful, in fact.

160
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,049
"On my brand new toilet

161
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,177
I did the same thing."

162
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,228
It's about the folly
of materialism.

163
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,067
God, I totally get it.

164
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,695
We all think that we can change
our lives with stuff, you know?

165
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,365
I do it all the time
with shoes or whatever.

166
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,046
If I could just have that or just
get this things will be different.

167
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,828
Mine's actually got a similar
theme about "wanting."

168
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,913
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

169
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,666
- Let's hear it, Candy.
- Okay.

170
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,920
- It's called, "My Heart Asked."
- What a lovely title.

171
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,718
"My heart asked,
'What's the answer?'

172
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,722
"I said, 'What answer?'
It said, 'You know.'

173
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,602
"I said, 'I don't know. I
give up. What's the answer?'

174
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,563
"And the heart said,

175
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,484
'The answer is don't give up.'"

176
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,672
- Good night, Sherry.
- See you at home.

177
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,467
- Bye, Candy!
- See ya.

178
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,014
Allan! Hi!

179
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,892
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey.

180
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,270
I want to talk to
you sometime about

181
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,200
something that's been
bothering me a little.

182
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,028
How about right now?

183
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,656
Sure.

184
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,959
I've been thinking
about you a lot,

185
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,962
and it's really been
bothering me, and I'm not

186
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,174
sure whether I want you to
do anything about it or not.

187
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm very attracted to you.

188
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,774
And I'm just tired of thinkin' about
it, so I wanted to tell you that.

189
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,442
<i>You seriously got in his car?</i>

190
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,193
I did.

191
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,489
- And told him you were thinking about him?
- I did.

192
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,241
And what did he say?

193
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,493
He said, "Oh. Okay."

194
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,330
- That's it?
- Pretty much.

195
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,665
Are you sure this is
really about Allan Gore

196
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,377
and not about you
wantin' to be reckless?

197
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,713
Maybe a little of both.

198
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,508
But also men, they get
to go to their jobs

199
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,345
and live in their careers and

200
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,681
we just stay home and

201
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,352
God, that's supposed
to be enough.

202
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,815
Look at our kids right
now on that jungle gym.

203
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:55,361
It is human nature
to take risks.

204
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:59,783
To go for somethin' with a little
thrill at the risk of falling.

205
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,035
I mean, look at their faces.

206
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,038
They are more alive than we are.

207
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,169
It's not appropriate.

208
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,340
- Why?
- Because it's not.

209
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,718
Where did you even
get all of this stuff?

210
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,761
Jenny's mom.

211
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,263
You're gonna have to
pick another costume.

212
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,223
- Why?
- I told you, it's not appropriate,

213
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,600
- especially for a girl your age.
- Dad!

214
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,143
No, no! Never mind.

215
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,396
I will not have you out on the streets
trick or treating as a trollop.

216
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,856
We will find something better.

217
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,818
This is why I did not want
her seeing that movie!

218
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,320
- "Grease"? That's a family picture, honey.
- No, no.

219
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,199
It's a bunch of talk
of girls putting out.

220
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,086
- You're judging me.
- I am not judging you.

221
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,923
Allan, you do some of your
best commentary with silence.

222
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,387
One of the reasons

223
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,390
why I go silent is because
when you get like this,

224
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,934
I don't know what to say.

225
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,124
I don't know what
you want me to say.

226
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,070
<i>The first time I took my wife
out, I knew she wasn't smart.</i>

227
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,031
<i>Why's that.</i>

228
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:22,531
<i>I took her to a drive-in
movie, you know,</i>

229
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,575
<i>and I asked if she wanted to
go in the back seat, you know.</i>

230
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,256
<i>She said she'd rather
use the ladies' room!</i>

231
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,248
<i>But the day I got married,
that was something.</i>

232
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>Everybody was crying.</i>

233
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,252
<i>During the ceremony, her
mother cried, you know?</i>

234
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,379
<i>All the way to the
hotel, my wife cried.</i>

235
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,507
<i>And when she got undressed,
I cried, you know?</i>

236
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,889
Did you read my short?

237
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,224
Sorry?

238
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:53,021
My short story from writing class.
I asked if you would read it.

239
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,607
I did. Excellent.

240
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,527
Yeah? What was it about?

241
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,447
It was about swans.

242
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,533
What about swans?

243
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,704
Wow. If I knew there was gonna be
a test, I would've studied harder.

244
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,248
Then study harder, Pat.

245
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,125
You have a Ph.D.

246
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,795
Yep. Not in swans, though.

247
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,799
Yep.

248
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,805
- Let me read it again.
- <i>My car, I tell you, Johnny.</i>

249
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,932
<i>- Bad car?
- I got the only car</i>

250
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,142
<i>dogs chase it, they catch it.</i>

251
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,025
<i>I told the graduating class...</i>

252
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,728
It's not about repainting or
redoing. We need a new sanctuary.

253
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:01,398
Well, a church is more about its
parishioners than its hardscape, Jo Ann.

254
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,358
That may be well and
true, but this church

255
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,402
isn't gonna be anything if we
don't grow the congregation.

256
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,820
And for that, we
need a new facility.

257
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:09,324
It's not just that it's
old, Jackie. It's crappy.

258
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,452
Nobody looking for a new
house of worship wants crappy.

259
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,537
It should make a statement.

260
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,207
Especially if we wanna
draw the younger couples.

261
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, aren't we supposed
to be the younger couples?

262
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,502
Where's your head, Allan?

263
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,298
I'm sorry? What?

264
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,718
Where's your head? You think
we need a new sanctuary?

265
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,682
- Well...
- You know, the thing about

266
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,685
religion and life and love

267
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,313
is that there's renewal in it.

268
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:44,484
And, to me, nothing
sells renewal better than

269
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,195
you know, something new.

270
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,199
I agree. We need
a major building.

271
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,327
So if we look at our finances

272
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,206
year-to-date, and we see

273
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,959
that we are already...

274
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,024
Well, you would think the teams themselves
would have to clean up, not the referees,

275
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,860
but I suppose that would just
make too much sense, wouldn't it?

276
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,029
Well, are we still on
for coffee tomorrow?

277
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,699
Is the sun still
planning to rise?

278
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,034
Well, I'll call you!

279
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,498
So is Betty not
feeling too good again?

280
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:46,712
Some headaches and so forth.
Probably stress-related.

281
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:51,342
You haven't got any tricks up your
sleeve to relax your bride, Allan?

282
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,721
Betty's seen all my tricks.

283
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,350
Well, this is me.

284
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,644
You tell her that I hope
she's feeling better and

285
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:06,273
she can always drop Alisa
off if she wants to rest.

286
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,276
- I'll tell her that. Thank you.
- Yeah.

287
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,154
You sure I can
trust you two alone?

288
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,995
Well, good night.

289
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,081
Candy.

290
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,841
Before, in the car.

291
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,679
What exactly was it
that you had in mind?

292
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Get in.

293
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,701
Would you be interested
in having an affair?

294
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,708
It's just something
I've been thinkin' about

295
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:10,046
and so I wanted to say it, so I
don't have to think about it anymore.

296
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,636
Okay. Well, I got my answer.

297
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,305
No, no, it's just.

298
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,351
I don't think I could.

299
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,853
You know, I love Betty.

300
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,526
And when we were living in
New Mexico, she had an affair.

301
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,028
Betty did?

302
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,405
Well, I can't believe that.

303
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,365
I know. I couldn't
believe it either.

304
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,659
It hurt me a lot and I wouldn't
want to do that to her.

305
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,786
That's fine, Allan.

306
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,955
I love Pat, too, and I
wouldn't wanna do anything

307
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,040
to hurt him either.

308
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,043
- I like Pat.
- Yeah.

309
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,965
He has the best
voice in the choir.

310
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,596
- Also, Betty just got pregnant again.
- Really?

311
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,142
Just recently.

312
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,937
So that would really
be unfair to her.

313
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,315
Especially since I don't
feel the same way about you

314
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,026
that I do about her.

315
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,702
So, I probably couldn't
do something like that.

316
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,198
Okay.

317
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,951
I was just putting the option
out there because of how I felt.

318
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,997
But I certainly don't want
to hurt you or your marriage.

319
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,542
All I wanted to do was

320
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,502
go to bed.

321
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:36,090
But I won't mention it again.

322
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,056
Good night.

323
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,907
<i>I feel so humiliated.</i>

324
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,159
It's probably for
the best, sweetheart.

325
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,580
Well, I wasn't looking for what's best. I
was out for something more transcendent.

326
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:12,126
And he broached it! He
invited the conversation.

327
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,669
What exactly did he say?

328
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,842
He asked me what I had in mind when
he knew very well what I had in mind.

329
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,846
And then he climbed into
my car. I mean, come on.

330
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,850
And why did he kiss me?

331
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,018
Right on the lips.

332
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,147
It wasn't exactly passionate.

333
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,275
But it wasn't a
brotherly kiss either.

334
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,237
Well, men kiss all the time
when they don't mean it.

335
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:42,656
No, I think he's waitin'
for me to make it happen.

336
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:45,017
He doesn't wanna hate himself
for being unfaithful to Betty.

337
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,995
So he's waitin' for
me to make it happen.

338
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,624
Well, he can forget about that.

339
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,126
I played my cards,
and that will be that.

340
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,212
Mornin'.

341
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,393
<i>Well, my word in
Heaven, are you a bird?</i>

342
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,228
No, wait. You're a
plane, aren't you?

343
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,896
I'm Superman!

344
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,107
You're Superman!
You're a man of steel!

345
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,148
And you might be the super-est
one I have ever seen.

346
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,320
- Well, thank you.
- Well, you're welcome. Hey, honey!

347
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,281
- Hey, Mom.
- You're back already, huh?

348
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:27,325
- Just to drop off. I filled my pumpkin.
- Yes, you did.

349
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,996
I'm just gonna go dump
it and come back out.

350
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,039
Well, what do you expect to do
with all that candy, young lady?

351
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,042
- I'll trade with Ian.
- Okay.

352
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,546
- Thanks for walking with them.
- Sure, sure.

353
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,089
Did you see Pat and
Ian on your travels?

354
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,009
I did see a pretty scary Elvis.

355
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,345
Yep, that would be Pat.

356
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,139
Him and Elvis, it's kinda
hard to tell them apart.

357
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,267
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

358
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,977
- Okay. Bye.
- Trick or treat!

359
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,064
Oh, my goodness, look at
you! Buzz, buzz, buzz!

360
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,233
If I could only have a brain!

361
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,236
Look how cute you guys
look. And look at you.

362
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:06,532
Don't sting me! The
Wicked Witch of the West!

363
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,835
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

364
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,463
- Oh, my God.
- I brought you a confection.

365
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,464
Yes.

366
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,633
And at the bakery, they said
if we ate it before 10:00 AM,

367
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,051
it won't make our asses fat.

368
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,429
At least, not completely.

369
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,932
- Then, shall we? Hurry up!
- Yes, we shall!

370
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,270
This is why your
people follow you.

371
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,814
Yeah. I let them eat cake.

372
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,816
So, listen.

373
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,610
I don't like the sound of that.

374
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,446
Remember I told you about
that other job offer

375
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,615
I had at Midwestern University?

376
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,117
- Which you turned down.
- Yeah, well.

377
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:54,496
- It turns out I reconsidered.
- What do you mean?

378
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:58,751
It was pointed out that the bishop
doesn't make offers like this every day.

379
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:04,214
- But it's in Wichita Falls.
- I'll come back and forth.

380
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,007
What do you mean you'll
come back and forth?

381
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,593
It's, like, 200 miles away.

382
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,680
Candy, this is my next calling.

383
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,640
What am I gonna do?

384
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,100
- You're my best friend.
- Our friendship won't change.

385
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,435
No, but you won't be here.

386
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,230
- And who's gonna replace you?
- We'll find somebody great.

387
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:23,024
Somebody who can get
the new sanctuary built.

388
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,111
Oh, my God.

389
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:29,280
You are the only one I have
to talk to here, Jackie.

390
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,574
That is not true.
You have Sherry.

391
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,536
And you're the belle
of the ball at church.

392
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,289
I mean Sherry is Sherry but

393
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,543
honey, you're my heart.

394
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,930
Hello?

395
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,851
<i>Candy. Hi, it's
Allan. Allan Gore.</i>

396
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,980
- Hey.
- <i>Hey. Hi.</i>

397
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:08,987
I have to go to McKinney tomorrow
to get my tires checked and rotated,

398
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,197
<i>and I know it's a drive,</i>

399
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,994
but I was wondering if you might
like to have some lunch with me.

400
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:23,252
You know, to talk a little more about
what we were talking about before.

401
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:24,836
Okay.

402
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,590
Okay, fine.

403
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,050
Well, how's 12:00?

404
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,011
- I'll meet you there.
- <i>Okay.</i>

405
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,723
- Meet you there. Bye-bye.
- <i>Okay.</i>

406
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,233
- Where were we?
- Who was that?

407
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,279
- It's just somebody.
- Somebody?

408
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,201
Somebody I'm thinkin' about
having an affair with.

409
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,401
You told me that 'cause you
want me to talk you out of it.

410
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,251
Pat and I, we...

411
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,338
Well, we kind of hit a plateau.

412
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,215
Every marriage hits one of them.

413
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,425
Well, I suppose yours did
and you did nothing about it.

414
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:16,221
Meaning what? If I'd had an affair, Bill
would still be taking out my garbage?

415
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:22,978
I'm talking about my garbage right
now, and not wanting to settle for it.

416
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,315
Sorry, that came out
wrong. Pat is not garbage.

417
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,693
Candy, I got front-door
friends and back-door friends.

418
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,029
Front-door friends show up
when they have a reason.

419
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,783
They knock. They
say the right thing.

420
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:39,160
Back-door friends, they just
bang in through the kitchen door

421
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,163
and drop whatever's
on their mind.

422
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,832
You are my best back-door friend

423
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,043
so I am gonna drop my
mind on your table here.

424
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,130
This will come to no good.

425
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,885
Jackie, I have done all the
things a wife is supposed to do.

426
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,431
The house, the kids, the meals.

427
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,937
Where is the payback?

428
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:06,813
Honey.

429
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,401
This is the payback.

430
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,280
Take it from me.
Somebody who lost it.

431
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,161
I can see your mind's made up.

432
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,888
- Thanks again, Ronnie.
- You're welcome.

433
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,808
- Don't work too hard.
- All right.

434
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,270
Hi! You're here.

435
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:48,898
- Hi.
- Hey.

436
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:51,483
Brought you this little card.

437
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,161
That is so sweet.

438
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,206
There you are.

439
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,500
Thank you.

440
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,669
I just worry, you know?

441
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,881
Jackie is the church,
when you think about it.

442
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,467
I just hope she doesn't
become a stranger.

443
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:20,512
Well, how can she not?
At least a little.

444
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,432
Wichita Falls is a three-hour
drive last I checked.

445
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,741
And, frankly, I don't know how
we're gonna go about replacing her.

446
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,814
And I don't wanna belong to
some stodgy-podgy church.

447
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:34,276
- No, that would be awful.
- Awful.

448
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,284
Well, should we talk
about our kids now?

449
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,786
Or maybe more Pat.

450
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:48,290
He was a champion trumpeter in
high school. Did I cover that?

451
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,257
I'm sorry. I've never done
anything like this before.

452
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,260
I haven't either.

453
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,979
I would never be able to forgive
myself if Betty ever found out.

454
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:15,024
That would just be
devastating to her.

455
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,859
I feel the same.

456
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,657
We would have to be so careful that
no one would ever know except us.

457
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,284
That's right.

458
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,746
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said about

459
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,540
just wanting to go to bed,

460
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:36,129
not getting too emotionally
involved and so forth.

461
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,257
That would be very
important to me.

462
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,259
Me, too, Allan.

463
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,638
God, I just wanna enjoy myself.

464
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:51,687
Without hurting
myself or anyone else.

465
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,985
Well,

466
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,989
I think we should think
about it some more.

467
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,950
Think about the
hazards and decide

468
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,704
whether or not we're
willing to take the risk.

469
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,251
Fine. Yeah, I think we should.

470
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,633
So, that's the plan then?
Think about it some more?

471
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,426
I think so.

472
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:50,888
<i>I'm not sure how many more of
these strategy session I can take.</i>

473
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,765
Yeah, I know.

474
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:55,643
- We just can't be too careful.
- <i>You know,</i>

475
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:58,647
if you don't go to bed
with me pretty soon,

476
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,400
you'll never be able to live up

477
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:05,987
<i>to the expectations
I have of you in bed.</i>

478
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:09,783
Yeah, don't think I
haven't thought about that.

479
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,415
Maybe just one more
planning session.

480
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,334
- We can have it here.
- <i>At your house?</i>

481
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,547
Yeah, we can meet for lunch.
People need to eat, right?

482
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,392
How was work today?

483
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,605
It's pretty good.
Kind of the same.

484
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,947
Have you been going
over your list, Allan?

485
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,535
- I'm sorry, what?
- The list.

486
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,872
The list of
potential baby names.

487
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,083
- I will.
- You will?

488
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,586
Yeah.

489
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,087
Okay.

490
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:14,138
If either of us wants it to end
for whatever reason, then it ends.

491
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,224
Agreed.

492
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:21,104
If either of us get too
emotionally involved, then it ends.

493
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,565
We should make that
rule number one.

494
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,026
Sure. Okay.

495
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,156
Okay. And if we
start taking risks

496
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,325
that shouldn't be taken,
then the affair ends.

497
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,579
- And we should always meet out of town.
- Agree, agree, agree.

498
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:49,048
All expenses, gas, motel,
food, will be shared equally.

499
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:52,843
We'll meet only on weekdays,
and I'll be in charge

500
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,346
of fixing lunch on
the days that we meet,

501
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,807
so that we just have more time.

502
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:00,143
And I'll also be in charge
of getting the motel room.

503
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,104
Same reason. It just gives
us more quality time.

504
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:04,105
Shall we

505
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,860
set a date for the
affair to begin?

506
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,866
Let's go with December 12th.

507
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,534
December 12th?

508
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:18,996
This year.

509
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,790
Great.

510
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,168
December 12th it is.

511
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,339
<i>Oh, Margaret, you don't
know what it does to me,</i>

512
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,968
<i>being near you all day in
surgery, only able to touch...</i>

513
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,104
<i>You alright?</i>

514
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,315
<i>I'm good.</i>

515
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:51,110
<i>This song gives me goosebumps.</i>

516
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:54,239
<i>I'm the same way about
"Pennsylvania 6-5000."</i>

517
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,162
What are you doin'?

518
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:03,957
What am I doin'?

519
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:08,628
You once told me that your
favorite character was Snugglepuss.

520
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,922
Did you not tell me that, Pat?

521
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,925
Snagglepuss.

522
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,303
Hey, angel girl.

523
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,555
Come out smarter than you go in.

524
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,307
I will, Mom.

525
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,028
- And no talking to boys.
- You're so silly.

526
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,742
Okay, buddy. Next
stop, preschool.

527
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,327
Hello?

528
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,828
<i>I'm at the Continental Inn</i>

529
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,874
<i>on the Central Expressway
towards Dallas, room 214.</i>

530
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,878
I will be there
in a few minutes.

531
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,249
What am I doin'?

532
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,968
<i>And show our boys some
red and blue pride.</i>

533
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,013
<i>Time for a couple of calls.</i>

534
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:13,182
<i>Hello, Darcy. Welcome
to The Dan Ram Show.</i>

535
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:16,061
<i>Hey, Dan, thanks
for taking my call.</i>

536
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,023
I made lunch.

537
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,247
Well, you look beautiful.
Really beautiful.

538
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,697
Thank you.

539
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,869
- Well, we should eat.
- Excellent.

540
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:20,041
Wow. Looks delicious.

541
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,127
Sorry.

542
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,802
You know, I've probably driven
past this motel a thousand times

543
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,387
and hardly knew it was here.

544
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,931
Yeah, it's funny that way.

545
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,559
Life. You know, the

546
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,437
bland and innocuous can

547
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,899
suddenly take on
vivid hues and colors.

548
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,614
I take a creative writing class.

549
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:55,160
- Well, that was really good.
- Thank you.

550
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,956
I would love to read some
of your writing sometime.

551
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:01,624
Really?

552
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,959
Well, that would make one of you

553
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,711
'cause Pat has no interest,

554
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,213
and I read all of his stuff
on electromagnetics...

555
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,883
Are we talking about Pat now?

556
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:14,387
No, sorry. We're definitely not.

557
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,085
Are you just gonna stand there?

558
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:48,671
Yes.

559
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:29,670
Sorry.

560
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:32,423
Allan, have you never
been French kissed before?

561
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:39,139
You've never had a woman's
tongue in your mouth?

562
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,896
Well, I think you're
gonna quite like it.

563
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,656
- Are you okay?
- I am.

564
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,951
So okay.

565
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,373
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

566
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,375
Yeah.

567
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,711
That was wonderful, Candy.

568
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,508
You're wonderful.

569
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:44,972
We need to shower.

570
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:46,807
I probably should have
added that to the list.

571
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:49,393
Always shower after

572
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:52,813
and that way, we won't
smell like each other.

573
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:55,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, and Allan.

574
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,735
Allan.

575
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:00,530
That was

576
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,574
wonderful.

577
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:11,999
Okay.
