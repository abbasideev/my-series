1
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>The scripture says that
he who is without love</i>

2
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:53,279
<i>does not know God,
for God is love.</i>

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>And we commend to His mercy
all who have loved and died.</i>

4
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,330
<i>That Your will for
them may be fulfilled.</i>

5
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:08,294
<i>As in baptism, Betty Gore put on
Christ, so in Christ, may Betty Gore</i>

6
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,839
<i>- be clothed in glory.
- Candy?</i>

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,675
<i>Clothed in glory.
Clothed in glory.</i>

8
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,510
<i>- Candy?
- Clothed in glory.</i>

9
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,846
Candy.

10
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,392
Are you ready?

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,441
Did you hear me?

12
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,944
I'm as ready as I'm gonna get.

13
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,407
Do not hold anything back.

14
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,910
If it even seems like
you're hidin', we lose.

15
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,916
It's time.

16
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,959
Mr. Crowder, are you
ready to proceed?

17
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,544
Yes, Your Honor.

18
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,588
The defense calls
Candace Montgomery.

19
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,055
<i>You heard Allan
Gore's testimony.</i>

20
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,642
<i>Was his description of
the affair accurate?</i>

21
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,270
<i>Yes.</i>

22
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,107
<i>It petered out into
nothingness? It was over-over?</i>

23
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,277
<i>Yes.</i>

24
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,281
<i>There was no burning ember that
made you wanna get back together?</i>

25
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,534
Definitely not.

26
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,996
Calling your attention to
the morning of June 13th,

27
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,999
why'd you go to the Gore house?

28
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,960
We had plans to see "The
Empire Strikes Back."

29
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,963
Alisa wanted to go, and Jenny
very much wanted Alisa to go.

30
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,049
Jenny is your
7-year-old daughter?

31
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,676
- Yes.
- And Alisa?

32
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,513
Alisa Gore, Jenny's best friend.
She had stayed the night.

33
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,181
Betty Gore's daughter?

34
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,601
- Yes.
- And you and Betty were friends?

35
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:10,727
Yes.

36
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,814
Prior to June 13th of this year,

37
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,236
had you and Mrs. Gore ever
exchanged any hostile words?

38
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,780
- No.
- Had you ever had

39
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,990
- any physical altercation?
- No.

40
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,743
When's the last physical
altercation of any kind

41
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:31,289
you can remember getting into
with anyone, other than June 13th?

42
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,042
I don't think
there ever was any.

43
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,294
How about a verbal altercation?

44
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,086
I can't think of any.

45
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,926
To the best of your recollection,
you have never fought with anyone,

46
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,930
either physically or
verbally, prior to June 13th?

47
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,640
That's correct.

48
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,935
So you went to the Gore
house that morning?

49
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,854
To get Alisa's bathing suit.

50
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,776
<i>She had a swimming lesson that day, and
if she was gonna stay another night,</i>

51
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,278
<i>I would have to take her.</i>

52
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,406
Did you call Mrs.
Gore prior to going?

53
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,242
- <i>No.</i>
- Candy.

54
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,702
Sorry, Why call when you
can barge right in, right?

55
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,163
<i>How did she seem
when you got there?</i>

56
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,165
She seemed a bit hurried.

57
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,459
Hurried?

58
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,839
She was planning for a big trip,
and she seemed anxious about it.

59
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,173
- Did she invite you in?
- Yes.

60
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,760
And what happened after
she invited you in?

61
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,096
We

62
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,931
<i>Talked about the movie plans.</i>

63
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,184
<i>I asked her if it was
okay for Alisa to go.</i>

64
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,477
We talked about the
swimming lessons,

65
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,479
<i>her upcoming trip.</i>

66
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,440
<i>She introduced me
to the new puppy.</i>

67
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:41,652
It was a normal,
friendly conversation?

68
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,780
<i>Very.</i>

69
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,491
<i>Until I was gettin'
ready to leave.</i>

70
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,161
<i>And what happened then?</i>

71
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,331
Well, I said that I should

72
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,877
get going as I had
an errand to run

73
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,671
and suddenly, she blurted out.

74
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,424
Are you having an
affair with Allan?

75
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,926
And what did you say?

76
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,138
Yes.

77
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,350
But it was a long time ago.

78
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,643
You wait a minute.

79
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,814
I thought maybe she had

80
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:24,068
found a card or a letter
that Allan or I had written

81
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,156
<i>and maybe she just
went to go get it.</i>

82
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,034
And when she reappeared?

83
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,664
She had an axe.

84
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,464
Were you in fear for
your life at that moment?

85
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,424
No.

86
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,093
Because I never dreamed
she would use it.

87
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,971
So what happened next?

88
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,140
Well, I said, under
the circumstances,

89
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,478
I should probably bring
Alisa home after Bible class.

90
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,898
<i>- And she said,</i> - No, I
don't wanna see you anymore.

91
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>And she put the axe down.</i>

92
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,903
<i>Had you ever seen that
axe before in your life?</i>

93
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,404
<i>No.</i>

94
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,864
<i>Did you even know
the Gores had an axe?</i>

95
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,741
<i>- No.
- What happened next?</i>

96
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,743
I went into the utility room

97
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,871
<i>to grab Alisa's bathing suit.</i>

98
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,748
And that was about the same time

99
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,377
<i>that Betty had returned from
the bathroom with a towel.</i>

100
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,336
And then what happened?

101
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,676
She just looked so hurt.

102
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,762
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to speak up.

103
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,849
Betty looked hurt?

104
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,352
<i>I put my hand on her shoulder.</i>

105
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,605
And that's when I said,

106
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,858
I am so sorry.

107
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,987
And she did not like that.

108
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,019
- You can't have him.
- <i>Then suddenly, she had the axe again.</i>

109
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,165
You can't have him.
You can't have him!

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,416
I'm gonna have another baby.

111
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,833
- You can't have him.
- Please. I don't want...

112
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,920
- You can't have him!
- I don't want him!

113
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,006
Betty, don't do this.

114
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,467
What are you doing?

115
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,761
Did you think, at that moment,
she was going to kill you?

116
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,097
I still didn't believe
she'd ever do that.

117
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,808
But, at some point,
your belief changed?

118
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,644
- Yes.
- When?

119
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,651
When she swung the axe up

120
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,490
and it hit me in
the side of my head.

121
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,537
Can you describe the
force of that swing?

122
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,498
It seemed with every
ounce of her strength.

123
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,459
Were you now concerned
for your life?

124
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,046
I knew then that she
wanted to kill me.

125
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,423
And then what happened?

126
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,637
I grabbed the axe.

127
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,638
You...

128
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,247
I thought I'd killed her.

129
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,087
And then what happened?

130
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,383
I just went to leave, but...

131
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:38,888
But what?

132
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,365
Let go of me!

133
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:06,750
Please, I don't want him.
No, I don't want him!

134
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,340
Please, I don't want him.
I don't want him! No!

135
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:32,169
<i>Do you recall how many times you
hit her when she was upright?</i>

136
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,504
No.

137
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,590
What about when she was down?

138
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,803
I just remember being afraid
that she'd get back up again

139
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,931
so I kept hitting her.

140
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,313
When you got to the Gore house,

141
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,359
did you have it in your
mind to kill Betty Gore?

142
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,485
No.

143
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:59,112
After she hit you in
the head the first time,

144
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,739
did you have it in your mind
then to kill Betty Gore?

145
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,658
No.

146
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,910
After she hit you the second
time, did you have it in your mind

147
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,287
- to kill Betty Gore?
- No.

148
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,538
When, if ever,

149
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,373
did it enter your mind that
you had to kill Betty Gore

150
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,294
to keep from being killed?

151
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,421
I never thought about it.

152
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,840
It just happened.

153
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,595
After you stopped hitting her,

154
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,181
what did you do?

155
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,895
<i>I walked around.</i>

156
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,814
<i>I stood back and</i>

157
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,816
<i>I looked at myself and I was</i>

158
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,236
<i>covered with blood.</i>

159
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,908
<i>What were your feelings
at that moment?</i>

160
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,874
<i>I just felt so dirty.</i>

161
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,586
<i>I had to get the blood
off. It was making me sick.</i>

162
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,714
I got into the shower.

163
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,318
I just wanted to make it
all go away, but I couldn't.

164
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,702
<i>And I kept thinking,
I have to be normal.</i>

165
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,457
<i>One thing at a time.</i>

166
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,086
Father's Day cards.
Swimming lessons.

167
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,296
Movies.

168
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,048
One thing at a time. Normal.

169
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,803
<i>And when you left the house
and started to drive home,</i>

170
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:51,517
what thoughts were running
through your mind at that moment?

171
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,146
That it was all a mistake.

172
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,983
Then it never happened.

173
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,905
It just never happened.

174
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,908
But it did happen.

175
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,541
You killed Betty
Gore with this axe.

176
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,294
- Sorry, please don't make me look at that.
- You killed her with this axe!

177
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,630
- Stop. Stop.
- You can look at it. Look at it!

178
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,258
Do you need a break?

179
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,806
No, I'm okay.

180
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,268
I'm okay.

181
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:40,900
Pass the witness.

182
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,285
When you left the house,
the baby was there.

183
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,247
Alone. With her mother dead.

184
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,044
I wasn't thinking
about the baby.

185
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,422
My mind wasn't thinking at all.

186
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,258
Well, it was thinking

187
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,219
should get in the shower.

188
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,555
It was thinking should
wash the blood off.

189
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:14,975
When you left the house,

190
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,229
you knew you had killed Betty
Gore with an axe, didn't you?

191
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,564
- I knew.
- And when you arrived back at the church,

192
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,650
you told no one?

193
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,401
I wanted to pretend
it didn't happen.

194
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,197
Wanted to "pretend"
it didn't happen.

195
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,868
You "pretended" with your friends
and fellow congregants at the church?

196
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,663
- Yes.
- You "pretended" with your close friend

197
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,082
and former pastor,
Jackie Ponder?

198
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,334
- Yes.
- You "pretended" with your husband?

199
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,254
You especially "pretended"
with the police.

200
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,715
I was not truthful at first

201
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,677
but I was lying to myself just
as much as I was lying to them.

202
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:53,097
But you're not lying today?

203
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,100
No.

204
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:02,730
You said Betty Gore went
to the utility room,

205
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,191
then appeared with the axe?

206
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,111
- Yes.
- You didn't try to flee?

207
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,446
As I mentioned earlier,

208
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:12,157
I didn't think my life was
in danger at that time.

209
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:14,993
But later, you did? Why
didn't you run then?

210
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,536
At that point, I was blocked.

211
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,538
What about the, the
door to the garage?

212
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,582
It was closed.

213
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,587
Your Honor, may I approach?

214
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,756
I'll show you exhibit 13.

215
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:33,845
You recognize this?

216
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,139
It's a lens to my sunglasses.

217
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,975
- Sunglasses you were wearing that day?
- Yes.

218
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,727
This lens was found

219
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,731
in the garage. Did
you go in the garage?

220
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,108
- No.
- Never?

221
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,444
I have never been
in the Gore garage.

222
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,571
Then how do you explain
the lens to your sunglasses

223
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,865
being in the garage?

224
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,786
Maybe during the struggle, it
somehow got kicked in there.

225
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:01,623
It got kicked in? While
the door was closed?

226
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:05,211
No, as I was trying to get out,

227
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,879
I had opened the door slightly

228
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,590
before Betty came back at me.

229
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,384
And so maybe it got
kicked into the garage

230
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,638
while the door was ajar.

231
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,598
That's the only explanation
I can come up with.

232
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,517
I bet you wish you could
come up with another.

233
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,769
- Objection.
- First, you said the door was closed.

234
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,938
Now, you amend it
to "slightly ajar."

235
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,816
Mrs. Montgomery.

236
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,317
Are you pretending
again with us now?

237
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,444
- Objection.
- Overruled.

238
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,780
Do you consider yourself
to be a good liar?

239
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,533
- Objection!
- Overruled, and stop your nonsense.

240
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,201
When you told your
fellow congregants

241
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,161
back at the church that nothing
happened at the Gore house,

242
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,580
did they believe you?

243
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,166
Yes.

244
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,877
When you told Jackie
Ponder, she believed you?

245
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,629
Yes.

246
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,798
When you told your
husband, he believed you?

247
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,219
- Yes.
- All these people believed you.

248
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,262
You must be a very good liar.

249
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:58,972
- Objection!
- And I would imagine if you could fool

250
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,098
the people that know you best...

251
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,101
- Objection!
- Oh, alright.

252
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,524
He did damage.

253
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,609
I should have done more with
that fuckin' sunglasses lens.

254
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,903
We had a pretty good day.

255
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,156
Nobody's buying
Candy's testimony.

256
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:18,533
- We don't know that.
- Are you listenin' to what's being said?

257
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,161
The media doesn't get a vote.

258
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:24,038
I was watching the jury
during Candy's testimony.

259
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,874
They were hanging on every word.

260
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,585
They seem to be with her.

261
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:29,920
What about Dr. Fason?

262
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,714
I'm not sure Judge Ryan will
find hypnosis admissible.

263
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,091
Yeah, well, we have to try.

264
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,678
Self-defense doesn't
account for 40 whacks.

265
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,430
We need Fason.

266
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,321
Honey.

267
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,784
Mom?

268
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,120
What are you doing here?

269
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,915
Why are you here?

270
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,126
You need to defend
yourself, honey.

271
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,378
Here, take this.

272
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,487
Candy, what's wrong?

273
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,797
Don, it's near midnight.

274
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,966
I tried calling. Why's
the phone off the hook?

275
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,552
We're getting prank calls.

276
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:02,804
Well, I need to be able
to contact you both.

277
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,181
Put the phone back on the hook.

278
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:05,808
Why? What's wrong?

279
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,353
Little change of plans.

280
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,689
I'm puttin' you up next.

281
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,982
Me? Why?

282
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,526
This is Texas, Pat.

283
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,319
Folks might be able
to forgive murder.

284
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,072
Adultery, not so much.

285
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,200
I did forgive her. And do.

286
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,370
In fact, I blame myself.

287
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,706
- Why?
- The relationship with Allan

288
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:32,917
was really more about
having someone to talk to,

289
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,171
and I wasn't

290
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,715
open enough with Candy.

291
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,384
I wasn't sharing myself enough.

292
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:43,220
Mr. Montgomery,

293
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:47,057
when you learned what
happened in that utility room,

294
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,852
you continued to
stand by your wife?

295
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:51,436
Of course.

296
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,273
Yes. She is not violent.

297
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:59,486
In fact, once the horror
passed, I felt some gratitude.

298
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:00,696
I thanked God.

299
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:02,782
You thanked God?

300
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,034
Betty is a much larger woman.

301
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:08,621
Add to that, she had an axe.

302
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:11,394
Could have easily
gone the other way.

303
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,460
Candy is loving.

304
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:17,337
She's not violent.

305
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,006
For this to have happened,

306
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:20,757
Betty came at her.

307
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,110
Did your wife tell
you what she'd done?

308
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,678
I think she blocked it out.

309
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,199
She lied to you. She
kept it from you.

310
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,580
I don't think she
really remembered.

311
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,103
She forgot about it, you think?

312
00:22:33,646 --> 00:22:35,022
<i>It's not that she
didn't remember.</i>

313
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:41,444
She knew she had swung the axe but
she suffered a dissociative reaction

314
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,323
which can induce a form of
amnesia to suppress anger

315
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,784
- and, in this case, shame.
- Hold on.

316
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:50,079
Are you sayin' she suffered
from a mental illness?

317
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,164
I'm saying she could not
reconcile her actions

318
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,624
with who she believes
herself to be,

319
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,460
so she, in a sense,
blocked it out.

320
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:00,088
Can this explain why after,
when she went back to church,

321
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,299
and then to Target to
buy Father's Day cards,

322
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:05,593
it was as if this incident
had never happened

323
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,388
in Mrs. Montgomery's mind?

324
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,472
She knew that it had happened

325
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,350
but by forcing herself to
go about her normal day,

326
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,396
it was as if she were trying
to erase the reality of it.

327
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,275
A portion of her personality was
split off from her consciousness.

328
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:23,612
Dr. Fason, I admit I
am no medical doctor

329
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:28,200
but when a personality gets portioned
off from somebody's consciousness,

330
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,452
that sure as hell sounds
like mental illness to me.

331
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,537
Approach, Your Honor?

332
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:42,173
I don't recall you jumping in with
the prosecution's medical experts.

333
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:46,051
I can pose questions to
witnesses, <i>sua sponte.</i>

334
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,929
You know what <i>sua
sponte</i> is, counsel?

335
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,639
It's Latin for "my courtroom."

336
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,976
We would like the record to
reflect your obstruction.

337
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,188
You don't have to introduce
what I say into the record.

338
00:23:57,897 --> 00:23:58,980
You know why?

339
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,399
'Cause if I said it, it's
already in the record.

340
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,526
I'm representin' a
woman who may go to jail

341
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:07,489
for the rest of her life, so
I'm going to perfect the record

342
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,910
so that it accurately
reflects your prejudice.

343
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,372
For that remark,

344
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,333
this court holds
you in contempt.

345
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,918
You're already holdin'
me in contempt.

346
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,294
Well, I'm doin' it again.

347
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,880
Another $100

348
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,216
and 72 hours in the
Collin County jail

349
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:29,929
effective immediately today
once we stand in recess.

350
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:41,523
Doctor, I'd like you to elaborate on
my client's dissociative reaction,

351
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:45,069
if you possibly can without
being abruptly interrupted.

352
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,279
Mrs. Montgomery couldn't fathom

353
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,697
that she was capable
of this kind of rage.

354
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,368
In fact, this woman has
an anathema to violence.

355
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:57,122
Candy Montgomery is also a person
who is excessively concerned

356
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:58,707
with what other
people think of her.

357
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,876
This is a common personality
pattern with individuals

358
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,129
who struggle with
dissociative reactions.

359
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,297
Doctor, I'm going to
instruct you to refrain

360
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,466
from narrative responses.

361
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,135
Answer only what
Mr. Crowder asks.

362
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:13,721
Is it common for individuals who
suffer dissociative reactions

363
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,599
to be excessively concerned
with how others perceive them?

364
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Yes.

365
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,645
It's partly why Mrs. Montgomery

366
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:24,274
emotionally walled herself off
from the events of that day.

367
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:27,026
It was only when
I hypnotized her

368
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,571
that she was fully able
to access her memory.

369
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:30,823
How so?

370
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:36,494
I was able to age-regress her to
the time when she first experienced

371
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,247
a dissociative reaction.

372
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:41,125
It happened when
she was 4 years old.

373
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:47,839
She was involved in a race of some sort
with a little boy who was older than her,

374
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,593
and the winner got to pump
some water into a jar.

375
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,804
She was mad because she lost and
she threw the jar into the pump

376
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,390
and it broke.

377
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,975
A piece of glass
from that broken jar

378
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:02,061
came back and hit her in the forehead
and she was bleeding down her face.

379
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,189
When she was taken
to the hospital,

380
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,067
<i>she was very frightened about
what was going to happen to her.</i>

381
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,656
<i>And she was screaming.</i>

382
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,409
Her mother said...

383
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,703
What will they think of
you in the waiting room?

384
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,789
Stop crying.

385
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,964
She relayed this to you
while under hypnosis?

386
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,302
Correct. She had no
conscious memory of it.

387
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,554
<i>Even under hypnosis,
she was very frightened</i>

388
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,224
<i>of expressing the
feelings that she felt.</i>

389
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:42,268
It took a very definitive suggestion
that when I counted to three,

390
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,729
she would express
those feelings.

391
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,273
I counted to three. One,

392
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,985
<i>two, three.</i>

393
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:01,831
Honestly, it was a scream

394
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:07,002
a sound, that I had
never heard before.

395
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:10,589
- Triggered by her mother saying "shh"?
- Yes.

396
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,843
Is it any coincidence that
Betty Gore also said...

397
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:16,929
It is not.

398
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,140
I look at that explosion
of violence with Betty Gore

399
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:24,144
as being the result of the anger
that had been buried within her

400
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:27,565
and blocked off all that time
since she was 4 years of age.

401
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,819
- When I told her that, she said...
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

402
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:34,155
Do you mean I killed my mother?

403
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:38,450
Was she killing her
mother in a way?

404
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:41,996
No. She was defending herself
against an attack by Betty Gore.

405
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:47,125
But, the depth of rage and violence,
that did in part come from something

406
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:48,418
that happened with her mother.

407
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,421
Let me ask you one
final question.

408
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:55,592
Did Candace Montgomery, at any
time during June 13th, 1980,

409
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:59,096
knowingly, that is
on a conscious level,

410
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:02,599
intend to kill Betty Gore?

411
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,602
I do not believe so.

412
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,899
Your Honor, we pass the witness.

413
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:19,324
Defendant hit the victim
41 times with an axe.

414
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:22,745
She pulverized Betty Gore's
face into a soft mulch.

415
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:28,166
Your testimony is that she did
so because Betty said "shh,"

416
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,793
reminding the defendant
of her mother?

417
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:34,088
My testimony is that she
was defending herself

418
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,591
against Mrs. Gore's
attack, and the violence

419
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:39,552
unleashed a rage that had
been within her for decades.

420
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:44,098
A rage caused by her mother saying
"shh" when she was 4 years old?

421
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,143
Not necessarily caused
by, but fueled by.

422
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,395
So she's sane enough
to argue self-defense,

423
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,356
but not sane enough
to be responsible

424
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:53,150
for chopping Betty
Gore into bits?

425
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,779
Again, her initial impulse
was to defend herself,

426
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,533
but during the struggle,
she lost control.

427
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,453
Just so I'm clear.

428
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,164
She knew she was
hitting Betty Gore

429
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,792
- over and over with an axe?
- Yes.

430
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:13,212
And she was swinging
it out of rage?

431
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:15,381
- Yes.
- Thank you.

432
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,056
So is it okay for
us to talk now?

433
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:26,851
Now that my testimony is over?

434
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:29,144
It's okay.

435
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,482
Why did you make me look
at the axe like that?

436
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,694
I needed emotion.

437
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,322
Our case is you had
an emotional break.

438
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,701
I needed the jury to
see a flicker of it.

439
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:54,294
So what now?

440
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:56,839
Betty Gore had it coming.

441
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:59,132
I need the jury to see
a flicker of that, too.

442
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,133
You're jokin'.

443
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,346
We can't risk her
being too sympathetic.

444
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,393
<i>I wouldn't say she
was mean, Betty,</i>

445
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,313
but she could be ornery.

446
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:14,815
Snappish is how
I'd describe her.

447
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,650
I'll say she was mean.

448
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,820
Betty Gore could be
quite confrontational.

449
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:22,739
Can you give us an example?

450
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,575
She would let out dismissive
snorts during my sermons,

451
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,161
right out there in front where
everyone could see and hear

452
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,413
'cause she was in the choir.

453
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:35,753
And not long after I arrived at Lucas,
she told me to go back where I came from.

454
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,131
- Betty Gore didn't like you?
- She hated me.

455
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:41,966
Candy didn't like
me much either.

456
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:42,967
At least, not at first,

457
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,386
but Candy was cordial.

458
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,971
Betty could be vicious.

459
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:50,559
You eulogized this woman. You
called her a beautiful person.

460
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:54,647
She was beautiful, as
are all God's creatures.

461
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:56,565
But she had a streak.

462
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:00,276
I pass the witness.

463
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:03,571
As the hour is late,

464
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,698
seems like a good
time to take a break.

465
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,992
For the day.

466
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,834
<i>What made him change his mind?</i>

467
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:03,131
Robert made an emergency call to
the Court of Criminal Appeals.

468
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,967
Honestly, I wish he hadn't.

469
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:09,930
If I did time during trial, more
ammo with the appellate court.

470
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,269
Thank you.

471
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:33,329
What are you doin'?

472
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,456
We knew Betty Gore.

473
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,125
Were friends with her.

474
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,127
For you to just throw
dirt on her like that.

475
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,254
I didn't do that.

476
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,589
Yes, you did.

477
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,050
You called her pastor to
the stand, to say what?

478
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,052
That God was okay with this?

479
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,847
I just established

480
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,601
that Betty could
be antagonistic.

481
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:57,477
Which is the truth.

482
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:59,604
This case is gonna
be your legacy, Don.

483
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,190
Oh, balls.

484
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,192
Legacy is you live, you die.

485
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:07,321
With any luck, it'll have mattered
a nick you did the former.

486
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,658
This whole thing is
gonna eat at you.

487
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,411
It may rot at you.

488
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,875
I got enough on my plate
without this shit, Carol.

489
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:40,687
<i>Basically, the doctor said
she acted out of self-defense,</i>

490
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:45,192
<i>and then transformed into an
unconscious killing machine.</i>

491
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:48,528
<i>Even the victim's pastor
weighed in with a shot,</i>

492
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,530
<i>along with other parishioners.</i>

493
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:55,119
<i>God loves everybody.
And he loved Betty Gore.</i>

494
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,290
<i>All I said, she
could be a handful.</i>

495
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,417
<i>I have never seen Betty
be unkind to anyone.</i>

496
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:05,629
<i>She was a wonderful
human being. Excuse me.</i>

497
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:16,932
It cannot be healthy for
you to be watching all this.

498
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:22,855
I can't be in the room until
closing arguments, so this is

499
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,275
the only way I know
what's going on.

500
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,113
I put all of this in motion.

501
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,033
Betty's dead

502
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,743
because I cheated on her.

503
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:39,205
You couldn't have
possibly foreseen.

504
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,836
You won't survive if you continue
to punish yourself this way.

505
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:49,507
I'm so grateful
for your support.

506
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,304
I just feel so alone.

507
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,932
You're not alone.

508
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,309
You're not.

509
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:19,012
I'm not about to
presume what you know

510
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:22,140
but I think I can safely figure
that all of you can figure

511
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,685
Candy Montgomery didn't
wake up on June 13th, 1980,

512
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,062
with a plan to kill Betty Gore.

513
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:31,441
She didn't cook her kids breakfast,
head off to Bible school,

514
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:33,735
perform a parable
in the sanctuary,

515
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:36,946
drive out to Wylie to pick up
Alisa's swimsuit, and then say,

516
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:40,659
"Hey, while I'm at it, let's
kill Betty Gore with an axe."

517
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,870
That makes zero sense.

518
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,206
Zero.

519
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:49,209
What happened here is not just
the most plausible scenario.

520
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,045
It's also exactly
what Candy told you.

521
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:55,006
She got there. Betty
was in a dark place,

522
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,966
agitated that she
might be pregnant,

523
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,636
upset that her
husband had left town.

524
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:02,555
Then, after some odd
perfunctory conversation,

525
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:05,851
Betty suddenly confronted
Candy with the weapon.

526
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:07,852
A struggle occurred.

527
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,854
Candy reacted in self-defense

528
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,691
after being struck with the axe.

529
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:15,027
And durin' that violent struggle

530
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,530
she snapped.

531
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:22,118
Dr. Fason confirmed that Candy
was truthful in her account.

532
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,580
He also found that the violence
triggered a childhood trauma,

533
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:32,837
rendering Candy into a rage that
caused her to go outside herself.

534
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:36,882
Candy's testimony was not
contradicted, not once, not by anyone.

535
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:39,592
Nor was Dr. Fason's
medical opinion.

536
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:42,011
All the police investigators,
the medical examiner,

537
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:46,851
the pathologist, none of them,
none could rule out self-defense.

538
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:49,186
So, how can you?

539
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:55,567
None could exclude that it was Betty Gore
who first came at Candy with that axe.

540
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:56,902
So, how can you?

541
00:37:57,695 --> 00:38:00,488
What they all did agree on,

542
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:03,867
a tremendous
struggle took place.

543
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:06,327
And if this were
a planned thing,

544
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:09,414
it was maybe the worst
planned crime ever.

545
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:13,169
Candy told people at the
church that she was headed

546
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,463
to Betty Gore's house.

547
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,548
Nor was there any motive.

548
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,717
As both Allan Gore
and Candy testified,

549
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:24,054
my client would stand nothing
to gain from killing Betty.

550
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,598
The affair would not
have been resumed.

551
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,185
Neither Candy nor
Allan had any interest.

552
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:30,852
It was over.

553
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:39,110
In Candy's mind, when
Betty Gore came at her

554
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,864
and struck her with that axe,

555
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:45,951
Betty was no longer human.

556
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:49,746
She had turned into an
animal in search of prey

557
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:52,165
and what ensued in
that utility room

558
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,417
was a violent death fight.

559
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,669
Betty Gore was a
much larger woman.

560
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,756
Adrenaline had to take over
Candy in order to survive.

561
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:05,136
Adrenaline did take over,
and human life was lost.

562
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,222
When a person gets killed,

563
00:39:07,223 --> 00:39:10,725
it's natural to wanna
hold someone accountable.

564
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:14,312
It's natural for you
to wanna fix things.

565
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,855
To make it right.

566
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:18,149
It may even cause some
of you to wanna believe

567
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,943
the police version of this.

568
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:21,444
But I remind you,

569
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:24,740
the police version itself
cannot rule out self-defense.

570
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:28,702
John Steinbeck

571
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:30,913
once wrote that,

572
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,916
"There are those among us who
live in rooms of experience

573
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,669
that you and I cannot enter."

574
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,088
If you're worried about
whether or not Mrs. Montgomery

575
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:41,632
has been punished in this case,

576
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:43,843
don't.

577
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,720
She lives in that
room of experience.

578
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:52,476
She lives in it and she's locked in
it and it now constitutes a cell.

579
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,354
A jail cell.

580
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:59,649
There won't be a day in
the life of Mrs. Montgomery

581
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,736
where she'll ever put out of her
mind that she committed this act

582
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,739
on June 13th, 1980.

583
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:12,663
There has been an American tragedy
played out in this courtroom.

584
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,166
But a conviction is
not a proper solution

585
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,794
to this particular tragedy.

586
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,631
The state has not
proved its case.

587
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,719
Reasonable doubt exists.

588
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,014
Good luck to you.

589
00:40:51,786 --> 00:40:54,120
Mr. Crowder hits the point

590
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,415
that Mrs. Montgomery's
testimony was not refuted.

591
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:01,295
The person to refute Candy
Montgomery's testimony isn't here.

592
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:04,215
She's dead. Chopped to bits.

593
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,883
See, that's the thing, when
two people are in a room,

594
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,262
and one ends up murdered, you only
get a single version of events.

595
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,710
Let's look at
Candy Montgomery's.

596
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,936
I suspect it quite helped
her that all the evidence

597
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:21,106
was available to her before she
formed her irrefutable testimony.

598
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:22,690
- Objection.
- Overruled.

599
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,610
Sit down, Mr. Crowder.
He didn't interrupt you.

600
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:33,119
Mr. Crowder argues none
of this makes sense.

601
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:36,955
I won't ask you to
make sense of it.

602
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:38,999
I'll just ask you to
look at what happened.

603
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:43,587
Candy Montgomery struck Betty
Gore 41 times with an axe.

604
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,631
Murdering her, disfiguring her,

605
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,925
breaking bones,
severing arteries,

606
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:51,302
obliterating her skull and face.

607
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:54,014
That is not consistent
with self-defense.

608
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:57,351
Mr. Crowder had the temerity

609
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:01,605
to say Betty Gore
stopped being human.

610
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:05,443
I ask you, who stopped
being human here?

611
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,070
Who was the animal?

612
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,156
He wants you to believe her.

613
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,658
To find her testimony credible.

614
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:15,076
Seriously?

615
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:16,744
She's lied at every turn.

616
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:19,914
To the police, to her
friends, to her own husband.

617
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,709
It was only after she was caught

618
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:24,210
cold with a thumbprint match

619
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,922
that Candy Montgomery
decided to become truthful.

620
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,302
Self-defense.

621
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,137
That's a lie.

622
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:37,474
Hitting an unconscious woman over
and over and over with an axe

623
00:42:37,475 --> 00:42:41,520
as she lay there in her blood,
that's not self-defense.

624
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:49,820
Because Betty said "shh," just
like my mother did when I was 4?

625
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:53,031
It insults this
court's intelligence.

626
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:54,616
It insults yours.

627
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:57,160
Candy Montgomery knew she
couldn't possibly explain

628
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,536
her actions on June 13th,

629
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:00,830
so she chose to deny them.

630
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,207
She chose to lie.

631
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,168
On June 14th, on the
15th, on June 16th,

632
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:08,797
the 17th, the 18th, she
stuck to the same story.

633
00:43:08,798 --> 00:43:10,799
With the police, her
friends, her husband.

634
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,551
She left Betty alive

635
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:15,429
went to Target to get
a Father's Day card.

636
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:19,433
Then, as the truth
catches up to her,

637
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:23,771
she pivots. Self-defense.

638
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,445
As for 41 whacks.

639
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:44,291
You deserve better.

640
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:48,254
Betty Gore deserves better.

641
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:00,181
Both lawyers were strong,
both made their points,

642
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,267
and both were not above
playing to the emotion.

643
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:04,602
This case stirred up such
strong and visceral feelings,

644
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,355
and neither attorney
shied away from them.

645
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,026
Hey, what do you think?

646
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,177
It's closer than
I'd like it to be.

647
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:15,823
We just have to wait.

648
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,703
Well, whatever happens, I'm
sure it'll all be for the best.

649
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:36,135
- Sherry's keeping the kids?
- For now.

650
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:38,220
Till there's a verdict.

651
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,270
You know, my mom always said

652
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:50,274
that there's no better comfort food
than Salisbury steak and macaroni.

653
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:57,573
You talk to her recently?
Other than the, the dream?

654
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:01,076
This mornin'. She
sends her prayers.

655
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,205
And her prayers usually take.

656
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,294
She's not mad at you, you think?

657
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:14,924
She can't be thrilled.
Especially after she reads that.

658
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,139
No, I just told her to stay
away from the newspapers

659
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,558
or anything like that.

660
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:28,395
Right.

661
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,688
Well, I just can't wait
for all this to be over

662
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:34,400
and I can go back to
having a normal life

663
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,238
and go to the market without
people staring at me.

664
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,951
Candy, I think no matter what
happens, this will never be over.

665
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:44,453
Well, if they find me innocent.

666
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:47,206
The jury can't
find you innocent.

667
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:50,500
They can only find
you not guilty.

668
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,420
And there's a difference.

669
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,756
We have no chance at
a normal life here.

670
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,093
We're going to have
to leave McKinney.

671
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:05,808
Let's just pray we
get that chance.

672
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:10,327
Well, I thought your
testimony was good.

673
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:12,815
Thank you.

674
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:16,110
I don't know if I
deserve you, Pat.

675
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:18,434
But I'm sure lucky to have you.

676
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:22,991
We're both lucky.

677
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,872
I think I wanna go back
and wait it out with Don

678
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:31,916
'cause I just am feeling a
little too anxious sittin' here.

679
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,503
Yeah. Okay.

680
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:43,429
Don! Don!

681
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,056
They're back.

682
00:46:47,016 --> 00:46:48,225
The jury. They have a verdict.

683
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,227
- Already?
- The judge just called.

684
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,022
I've got the car
ready to take us back.

685
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,858
We'll meet you there.

686
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:28,390
Gentlemen, comin' through.

687
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:38,776
All rise!

688
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:50,871
You may be seated,
ladies and gentlemen.

689
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:56,960
I have some instructions for
the attorneys, the parties,

690
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:59,046
the spectators.

691
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:01,355
When I read the verdict
into the record,

692
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,593
I want no reaction from
anyone in this courtroom.

693
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:09,223
Whatever that verdict might be, no
vocal reaction, no physical reaction.

694
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:13,394
And now don't think I'm picking
on y'all. That's standard.

695
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:15,475
Alright, bring the jury in.

696
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:27,615
Be seated.

697
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:36,499
Alright then, Mr. Foreman, has
the jury reached a verdict, sir?

698
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,543
Your Honor, we have.

699
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,720
Will the defendant please rise?

700
00:49:05,196 --> 00:49:06,196
We, the jury,

701
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:11,025
find the defendant not guilty.

702
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,663
Each member of the jury that
concurs with this verdict,

703
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:18,917
will you indicate it to me
by raising your right hand?

704
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:21,669
The court will accept the
verdict and order it filed.

705
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,922
This case is adjourned.

706
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:35,810
Congratulations, Candy.

707
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,507
How do you feel about
this? Were you shocked?

708
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:27,986
What about our beds and stuff?

709
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:32,365
Well, the movers will come for that,
baby. We just take what we need for now.

710
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:34,909
The movers will bring it
all the way to Georgia?

711
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,996
Yep. That's why we
call them movers.

712
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:52,677
Why don't you guys go say
goodbye to Miss Sherry?

713
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:54,304
- I forgot something.
- Hi, hey, bud.

714
00:50:54,305 --> 00:50:56,806
Hey, how you doing?

715
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:59,852
Good? You're gonna be good,
right? Okay. See you guys.

716
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:10,028
I promise I'll call as
soon as we get there.

717
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:12,573
Okay. You better.

718
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:18,871
Are we all set?

719
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:21,415
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

720
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:39,433
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

721
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:15,261
I would've called, but I was
afraid you might say don't come.

722
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,181
Anyway.

723
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:23,726
Pat, me, and the kids
are leavin' McKinney

724
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:25,813
and we're gonna go
try and start anew

725
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,400
near my folks in Georgia.

726
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,447
So, I just wanted to
come by and say goodbye.

727
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,953
- Okay.
- Also, Allan.

728
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:44,248
I'm sorry.

729
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:48,878
For everything that
happened. I never meant...

730
00:52:53,466 --> 00:52:54,884
Me, too. I'm sorry, too.

731
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:57,595
Betty and I, we
were good friends.

732
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,014
You know, she was a...

733
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,933
She was a good person.

734
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:07,813
We were a lot alike
in some ways. Just a

735
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:11,025
good, good person.

736
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:15,696
Anyway,

737
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,742
I wish you a good life, Allan.

738
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:22,912
Yeah. I wish you
a good life, too.

739
00:53:26,624 --> 00:53:27,624
Well.

740
00:53:30,753 --> 00:53:32,004
Okay.

741
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:34,172
Bye-bye.
