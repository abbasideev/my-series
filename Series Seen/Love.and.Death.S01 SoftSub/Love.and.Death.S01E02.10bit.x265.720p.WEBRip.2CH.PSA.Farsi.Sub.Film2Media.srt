1
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,604
- Candy?
- Yeah?

2
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,857
I'm due back at work soon.

3
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:29,858
Sure. Come on in.

4
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,362
Well, I think under
the circumstances,

5
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,532
God won't bat an eye at
us showering together.

6
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,120
Probably not.

7
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,169
- Is there enough room?
- Oh yeah, plenty.

8
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,546
Are you sure? 'Cause I...

9
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:56,552
No, we're fine. See? It's not
the best water pressure, but...

10
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,104
Allan.

11
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,399
Thank you.

12
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,903
For what?

13
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,073
Just thank you.

14
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,662
Oh, my dear heaven.

15
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,667
The idea that this may be the
last day I listen to that choir.

16
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,169
Well.

17
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,214
It's not gonna be the
last time. Simple as that.

18
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,259
I may not be your
minister going forward,

19
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,304
but I want you all to know
that you are in good hands.

20
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,848
My replacement,
Pastor Ron Adams.

21
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,392
Stand up, Ron.

22
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,520
You will be lucky to have
him and his wife, Mary.

23
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,023
Please stand, Mary.

24
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,818
And, my God,

25
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:23,282
they will be so lucky
to have all of you.

26
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,202
He's gonna be a disaster.

27
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,538
- Now, we have to give him a chance, Betty.
- Look at him.

28
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,333
Look at him.

29
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,169
Who wears an orange
coat to church?

30
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,171
- Or to anywhere?
- Honey, hey.

31
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,965
We're to take spiritual
guidance from him?

32
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,176
Plus, where's our
loyalty to Jackie?

33
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,470
Betty. She wasn't fired.

34
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,180
Yes, you keep saying that, Don.

35
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,099
Well, why would she
have been fired?

36
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,060
Because she got a divorce,
and it isn't acceptable

37
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,394
for a minister to do that.

38
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,897
He looks so stiff and rigid.

39
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,024
He looks like a child.

40
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,403
Always makes me nervous
when the choir clusters.

41
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,074
Betty thinks you're being forced
out on account of your divorce.

42
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:11,789
Well, it's all been so rush-rush.
And we end up with him?

43
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,624
- He's a child. In an orange coat.
- Betty.

44
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,585
You need to listen
to me. All of you.

45
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,673
You need to make
this church work.

46
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,676
I want you to get
along with this man.

47
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,721
Everybody here takes
their cue from the choir.

48
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,350
I saw that. What was that?

49
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,395
Excuse me?

50
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,276
You two just looked at
each other like you got a

51
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,274
big secret.

52
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,952
You're both on the council.

53
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,747
You would both know church
business. Was she fired?

54
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,416
- Were you?
- Betty.

55
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,126
God wouldn't just
call you away from us.

56
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,879
But a bishop would.

57
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:06,945
<i>Feels a little sleazy.</i>

58
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:09,114
Well, I think that's
what I like about it.

59
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,492
It's six and a half
dollars cheaper.

60
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,495
I kind of like being
cheap, too. It's sexy.

61
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,166
My goodness. This
looks delicious.

62
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,006
And so do you.

63
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,677
I'm finger-lickin' good, I am.

64
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,812
I found a few cookies on
my windshield at work.

65
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,689
That wouldn't be
your doing, would it?

66
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,943
Well, gee, I don't know. Were
they snowmen? Little angels?

67
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,279
There's all kinds of
Christmas cookies, you know.

68
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,616
I would need more detail
before I could answer for sure.

69
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,962
Can I ask you a question?

70
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:12,218
Is Betty okay? 'Cause she got really
riled up with that whole minister thing.

71
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,138
Betty doesn't love change.

72
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,850
She doesn't even
like contingencies.

73
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,227
I think if she had it her way,

74
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,980
everything would be
exactly how it is today,

75
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,357
tomorrow, and the next day.

76
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,484
Well, she got a little scary.

77
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,236
You didn't even see
the worst of it.

78
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,239
You know the little
angels that people made

79
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,320
- out of pipe cleaner and so forth?
- What about 'em?

80
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,122
- This kind of stuff has got to go.
- Why?

81
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,626
One of our goals will be to spruce
up our outward-facing appearance.

82
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,671
Homemade decorations
tend to convey

83
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,134
"parochial," which is not best
for attracting new parishioners.

84
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,304
Maybe it's you who should go.

85
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,431
She said that?

86
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,394
She got terrible postpartum
after Alisa was born,

87
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,979
which had started
during the pregnancy.

88
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,441
But I think it's
flaring up again.

89
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,278
I should take her out to
lunch or coffee or something

90
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,072
'cause I've been neglecting
her all this time

91
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:16,075
while I've been not
neglecting her husband.

92
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,208
That was a joke, Allan. I'm sorry.
It wasn't an especially good one.

93
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,294
I just feel like
an awful person.

94
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,089
Betty's the most

95
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,633
wonderful wife.

96
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,303
She's pregnant with my child and

97
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,891
here I am, in a
sleazy motel room

98
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:43,851
with a red velvet bedspread.

99
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,064
You know, we're not bad people.
We just have to stay vigilant.

100
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,526
We stick to our plan, and
we can never, ever allow

101
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,404
Betty or Pat to get hurt.

102
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,407
Never, ever.

103
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,909
Ever.

104
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:48,833
He has the most perfectly
shaped penis I have ever seen.

105
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,711
Candace Lynn Montgomery.

106
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,714
I'm not saying he puts it
to the best possible use.

107
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,966
I still don't get it.

108
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,886
I'm not sure I do either
'cause, you know, like you said,

109
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,889
he's a little paunchy, but...

110
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,307
God, I don't know. Maybe it's a

111
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,602
pheromone sort of thing?

112
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,230
I don't know. It's nice to be

113
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,274
noticed. You know, just
to be adored a little.

114
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,068
Pat doesn't adore you?

115
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,279
No, he does.

116
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,781
- Just in his own way.
- Well, I have to say,

117
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,160
part of me is a
little bit jealous.

118
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,289
I've got the imagination for
adultery, just not the guts.

119
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,083
You know, I'm not sure
it takes guts so much.

120
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,586
It's more like fear.

121
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,922
You need to be careful.

122
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,309
Everything looks normal. Fine.

123
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,810
I'd even say perfect,
with the baby.

124
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,562
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,066
Well, we need to pay attention
to your hypertension and stress.

126
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,485
That can affect the fetus.

127
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,196
You can sit up now.

128
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,076
So, how's everything at home?
Everything okay? Things good?

129
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,620
Everything's like home at home.

130
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,748
Raising one child, getting
ready to have another.

131
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,001
Betty, he's just
looking after us.

132
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,921
Sometimes, it feels like
I'm not doing right.

133
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,423
Not being right.

134
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,691
This may be the best
cookie I've ever eaten.

135
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,653
- It's so moist.
- The trick is to take 'em out early.

136
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,530
I got the idea to just
cook 'em for only half

137
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,408
what the recipe
calls for, and <i>voilà.</i>

138
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,952
That's French for "perfect."

139
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,206
- So, half-baked?
- The cookie is, not my idea.

140
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,420
Tell me something about
you that nobody else knows.

141
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,673
I'm not sure there is anything.

142
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,133
Oh, come on.

143
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,552
Something that you wouldn't
want other people to know,

144
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,555
but you would like me to know.

145
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,518
I don't think there is anything.

146
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,981
There must be something
about maybe something that

147
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,153
you're especially
proud of or ashamed.

148
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,703
Okay. This is something
I am proud of but

149
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,833
- ashamed to admit I'm proud of.
- I love that already.

150
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,959
In high school,

151
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,549
I was the Kansas State Grand
Champion in the wheat competition.

152
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,594
- The wheat competition. Yeah.
- The wheat competition?

153
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,723
You sort through all the
stalks with tweezers.

154
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,351
You pick out the best stuff.

155
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,496
I can tell you're
trying not to giggle.

156
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,231
I'm not.

157
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,732
Bob Dole

158
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:46,279
presented me with the silver
tray, which is the highest award.

159
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,533
You can laugh.

160
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,786
So sorry!

161
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,841
I've been thinking about

162
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,261
something a lot, and I'm trying
to wrap my head around it.

163
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,263
What?

164
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,226
Betty having an affair. It
just seems so unlike her.

165
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,602
I know.

166
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,693
I was getting ready to leave
on a six-week business trip.

167
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,363
She kind of went to pieces.

168
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,283
We were living near the state
college, and, one night,

169
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,869
she went home with
one of the students.

170
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,829
How'd you find out?

171
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,581
She confessed.

172
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,792
Almost right away. I didn't
even suspect anything.

173
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,630
She just broke
down in tears and,

174
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,799
blurted it out.

175
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,968
Part of me thinks

176
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,972
she came clean out of guilt.

177
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,351
- Another part.
- Another part what?

178
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,898
I think maybe she
meant to punish me

179
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,857
for traveling.

180
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,068
And the reason she told me.

181
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,448
It was calculated to control

182
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,491
my behavior.

183
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,916
That must've hurt you a lot.

184
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,251
It did.

185
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,467
I have another question for
you, and it's kind of important.

186
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,678
Okay.

187
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,427
Do you like roller coasters?

188
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,745
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

189
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,626
It's so cute. Will
you look at that?

190
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,588
That is so darling!

191
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,214
Thank you so much,
Candy. It's precious.

192
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,466
You can always exchange if
you don't like the color.

193
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,303
What? No. I love it. I love it.

194
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,305
- My heart.
- It looks so cute.

195
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,016
I cannot wait to meet her.

196
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,768
- Okay. Alright.
- Okay. Next one's from Sherry.

197
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,438
Here we go, thank you.

198
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,115
Oh God! Oh God!

199
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,618
"Oh, God.

200
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,871
"Our help in ages past.

201
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,749
Our hope for years to come."

202
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,169
The choir sings those words.

203
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,171
All of you,

204
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,465
sing those words.

205
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:37,886
But, what do they mean?
Let us think about that.

206
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,515
Well, God has helped us...

207
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,101
- From Pat.
- And those before us,

208
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,812
for ages past.

209
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,482
And He is our hope, is He not?

210
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,151
God, He's our...

211
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,152
our hope.

212
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,322
Our wonderful and eternal...

213
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,204
Anyway, it continues.

214
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,914
Our shelter from
the stormy blast.

215
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:11,126
I didn't expect him to be
good, just not that terrible.

216
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,254
Betty wants to leave the church.

217
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,050
- What?
- She's that put off.

218
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,677
What, and do what?
Just go back to Wylie?

219
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,680
I don't know. It's
like she's channeling

220
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,393
everything wrong with the world
and just making him to blame.

221
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:38,571
Listen, as we get closer to the day,
I'll have to stay close to home more.

222
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,909
The last thing I want is to be
here when she goes into labor.

223
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,413
So just for the next few weeks.

224
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,915
Of course.

225
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,088
You know, if she did go into labor,
and she couldn't get ahold of me,

226
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,798
she'd call you.

227
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,010
Well, and I would
be there in a flash.

228
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,263
I know you would. She knows it.

229
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,142
'Cause you're a good friend.

230
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,110
You okay?

231
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,202
I'm gettin' in too deep.

232
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,664
What do you mean?

233
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,547
I don't want to fall
in love with you.

234
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,548
I don't

235
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,552
wanna have to deal with
myself if we go too far.

236
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,680
I think about you too much.

237
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,229
You don't find yourself thinking

238
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,441
too much about me?

239
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,737
Well, I think about
you all the time.

240
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,324
It's gettin' too serious.

241
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,201
Well...

242
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,164
we just won't let it. Okay?

243
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,680
Kids! Dinner!

244
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,769
Mamma mia! That's
a spicy meatball-a!

245
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,729
Sweetie, can you please
go find your sister

246
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,564
and tell her we're about to eat?

247
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,817
Mamma mia!

248
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,986
That boy watches
too much television.

249
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:46,907
Hey, Pat! What did we say about
spit valves at the dinner table?

250
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,619
Hey, Jenny! Ian!
Come on, let's go!

251
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,996
Hey, did I tell you

252
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,117
that the Gores were thinking
about leaving the church?

253
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,793
What? Why?

254
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,712
Betty cannot stand
the new minister.

255
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,048
And, honestly, I don't
think she's being very fair.

256
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,552
Not everyone can be as
earthy and warm as Jackie.

257
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,805
Well, he did tell
me no more puppets.

258
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,639
Excuse me?

259
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,308
Put the kibosh on it.

260
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,311
He said no more puppets
during children's sermons.

261
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,149
I know.

262
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,987
<i>I've been telling you from the
start, the man is cold and unfeeling.</i>

263
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,947
And he treats his
wife like property.

264
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,032
- Have y'all noticed that?
- Alright, alright.

265
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,951
Why do you keep
defending him, Candy?

266
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:34,414
Because I promised Jackie
I would, truth be told.

267
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,626
And the way he snorts
at us sometimes.

268
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,715
That we can't hold against him. He
evidently had sinus cancer as a child.

269
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
What?

270
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,343
I just want Jackie back.

271
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,263
We all do, honey. We
all do. We all do.

272
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,975
Sorry, I'm a little late.
Shall we get started?

273
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,478
- Let's start with the services.
- Excuse me?

274
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,440
- They're boring.
- Betty.

275
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:07,030
And cold! And why? Why
would you ban Pat's puppets?

276
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,157
I did not ban them.

277
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,701
I just said no more
Peter Rabbit as Jesus.

278
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,382
A little spontaneity
might be a good thing.

279
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,290
Sometimes, I think you mistake
this for a social club.

280
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,209
This is a church, Betty.

281
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,460
Doesn't have to be a dull one.

282
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,837
Betty.

283
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,299
Transitions do call
for some patience.

284
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:31,512
I'm not a patient, Don.
Please don't treat me as one.

285
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,768
What is going on with her?

286
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,728
It's the stress
from the pregnancy.

287
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,147
Well, she got a
little Joan Crawford.

288
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,607
Once she has the baby,

289
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,527
the light will come back
on, and she'll be okay.

290
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,488
Allan... No, never mind.

291
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:52,951
- What?
- It's just what I said before.

292
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,664
I don't know if I can handle
the way I'm feeling about you.

293
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,334
And I know that we said that...

294
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,461
That falling in love
was against the rules,

295
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,743
but that's what's happening.
I'm falling in love with you.

296
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,300
And I get scared for me,
and I worry about Pat.

297
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:14,805
I mean, this would
be too hard on him.

298
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,098
And...

299
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,185
I don't want to
lose our friendship.

300
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,396
I just don't want
anybody to get hurt.

301
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,022
I don't want this
to get outta hand

302
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,734
any more than you do,
Candy. But, honestly.

303
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,655
You and me

304
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,951
it's helped me
and Betty somehow.

305
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,913
- How so?
- I just feel

306
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,292
better.

307
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,213
I think it's because I have you.

308
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,466
We said that if we started to
get too emotionally involved,

309
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,469
that it... it's over.

310
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,099
That was our first rule.

311
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,453
I can see the head.

312
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,050
You have a beautiful girl.

313
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,511
She's 100% perfect.

314
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,496
She is so precious. I just...

315
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,582
- I can't speak.
- Thank you.

316
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,086
Princess.

317
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,548
Honey, think we might need to
get Princess a new playmate.

318
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,799
- A puppy?
- I want a puppy!

319
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,884
Me too!

320
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,262
She is so adorable.
Can I hold her?

321
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,514
Of course!

322
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,225
Alright.

323
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,688
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

324
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:12,232
Is there anything
like a newborn?

325
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,193
I don't think so.

326
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:19,030
You know, Bethany really is the
most beautiful little thing.

327
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,824
Oh, thank you.

328
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,911
Hey, Betty seems
good. Bright, even.

329
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,547
Well, she's doing better.
She's doing better.

330
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,333
You know, in spurts.
She still has her bouts.

331
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,836
But

332
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,881
we're we're headed to
Kansas in a few days

333
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:39,259
to introduce Bethany
to the grandparents.

334
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,179
So, you know, next week.

335
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,889
Oh, yeah. Got it. Yeah.

336
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,976
But we return that
following Thursday.

337
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,354
So, maybe that Friday.

338
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,900
Friday it is. I'll get a sitter.

339
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,152
- Great.
- Okay.

340
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,707
Well.

341
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,226
- Hi!
- Hey! You made it!

342
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,312
Hi, baby.

343
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,980
- How you doin', sir?
- Good to see you.

344
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,025
I'm so excited to
see you, little one.

345
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,194
Hello!

346
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,951
Mr. Mustard had just gone to
bed when his doorbell rang.

347
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,375
Hey.

348
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,340
- They are really loud tonight?
- Yeah.

349
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,509
Do you ever wonder what
they all say to each other?

350
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:30,264
Lord knows, but they
certainly sound chipper.

351
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,353
What?

352
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,563
Nothing.

353
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,398
Why the look?

354
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,110
Just looking at you and

355
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,447
looking and thinking.

356
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,033
About what?

357
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,413
Sometimes, I forget
how pretty you are.

358
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,002
Pat.

359
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,231
I'm sorry, honey.

360
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,650
I'm sorry. I'm just...

361
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,903
just really tired tonight.

362
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,332
Don't touch me.

363
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,252
Hey, honey.

364
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,175
You think I don't know.

365
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,970
That you're not
attracted to me anymore?

366
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,011
That you don't wanna touch
me, don't wanna touch me?

367
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,058
That's not fair.

368
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:39,769
That's not true.

369
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,561
You wanna have a discussion
about fair, Allan?

370
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,063
Why don't you start?

371
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,907
She just kept saying, "You
don't love me anymore.

372
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:57,118
- You don't love me anymore."
- Well, you did reassure her, right?

373
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,624
Yes. But she's convinced
that I'm not attracted to her

374
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,877
because she's fat
after having a baby.

375
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,837
Are you attracted to her?

376
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:09,215
Of course.

377
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,133
I was just spent.

378
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:15,137
My tank was empty because
I'd been with you all day.

379
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,850
The thing is, she
never initiates.

380
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,062
We haven't had sex since

381
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,774
before Bethany was born,
so for her to make a move

382
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,653
and to be rebuffed just...

383
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,322
What are you gonna do?

384
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,371
Candy, I think we should end it.

385
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,001
Us end it?

386
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,713
Us? No! What?

387
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,589
No! No.

388
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,716
- Okay.
- No, but now, you're being unfair!

389
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,134
- I'm not... Okay, shh.
- It's not... Do not...

390
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,805
No! Hey! Do not shh me!

391
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,017
You cannot just squelch another
person and their emotions.

392
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:07,148
Do not shh me ever.

393
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,824
I'm hurting Betty, Candy.

394
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:21,286
This affair is affecting
my marriage now.

395
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:24,999
You can't perform
with Betty one time

396
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,126
and, suddenly

397
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,295
you wanna end it?

398
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,755
I'm not saying that we
should definitely end it.

399
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,925
Then what are you saying?

400
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,888
Just that we should
think about it.

401
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,390
I don't wanna hurt her, or Pat.

402
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,061
No. Well, 'cause he's... He's
just the best singer in the choir.

403
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,564
We've become too close.

404
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,110
And I'm afraid that I

405
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,032
might not love her anymore.

406
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,870
And I can't let that happen.

407
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,999
We've both been using each other
to fill the gaps in our marriages,

408
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,793
and that's not right.

409
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:11,921
Right?

410
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,594
Let's just slow it down some.

411
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,860
Thank you all for
being here today

412
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,906
for the groundbreaking of
our wonderful new sanctuary.

413
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,284
Now, it's my honor
to cut this ribbon.

414
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,314
- Hello?
- <i>Hey</i>.

415
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,775
Hey, stranger.

416
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,153
- <i>How you doin'?</i>
- Yeah, I'm good.

417
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,281
I'm good. Yeah. You?

418
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,157
Pretty good.

419
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,662
Except for missing a few
of those special lunches.

420
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,207
Yeah. Me, too.

421
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,004
How's Betty?

422
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,173
You know.

423
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,510
Not too good, actually.

424
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:45,888
After that night when
I didn't respond,

425
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,517
she sort of went into a hole
and hasn't come out of it.

426
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,229
So, how are you doing?

427
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,858
Okay. Okay.

428
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,526
I'm taking a new job.

429
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,737
<i>ECS Telecommunication.</i>

430
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,989
I thought that you liked
working at Rockwell.

431
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,032
<i>Yeah.</i>

432
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,660
It's just if I want to
advance at the company,

433
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,412
that would mean
more travel, which,

434
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,750
<i>- you know, isn't an option for Betty.</i>
- Nope.

435
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,798
Why don't we get lunch
and talk face-to-face?

436
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:27,472
I'm not saying I want
us to end, Candy.

437
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,433
I don't. But, I need...

438
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:34,271
I need for me and
Betty to get better.

439
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,357
Stronger.

440
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,484
You said that being
with me helped.

441
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,527
Helped me, yes.

442
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,490
But, not me and her.
Certainly not her.

443
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,869
Is she feeling any better?

444
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,916
She wants to go to
Marriage Encounter now.

445
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,209
Really?

446
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,755
I think it'd do us some good.

447
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,009
The next one is in October.

448
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,471
What?

449
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,517
Marriage Encounter
will be the end of us.

450
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,645
Let's just see what happens.

451
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,565
Candy, let's just
see what happens.

452
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:32,538
I really hate to ask
you this right now.

453
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,414
But

454
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,917
it takes place over a weekend,

455
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:42,588
and Betty was wondering,
as was I, if you and Pat

456
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,299
could possibly take the kids.

457
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,635
Alisa loves you,

458
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,806
and Betty won't trust
anyone else with Bethany.

459
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,059
It would just... It would be.

460
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,812
Sure.

461
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,188
I'd be glad to.

462
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,051
You never mentioned a castle.

463
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,846
I did not know, honey.

464
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,191
I really don't know about this.

465
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,278
Well, let's hope the
food's good at least.

466
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,823
Spouses are expected to
be at each other's sides

467
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,617
at all times.

468
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,996
I should add at the
side of your own spouse.

469
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:02,335
Sometimes, we get couples from
California, so I always make sure.

470
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,880
Televisions are not to be
turned on in the rooms.

471
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:09,550
Not even a little. No
phones, no newspapers.

472
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,344
Nothing to get in the way

473
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:14,640
of couples communicating
about their feelings.

474
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,391
<i>I will take the
opportunity right now</i>

475
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:21,354
<i>to propose your first
Marriage Encounter question,</i>

476
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,606
<i>which you will each
endeavor to answer</i>

477
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,901
<i>in your individual Marriage
Encounter notebooks.</i>

478
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:31,031
<i>You'll find these in your room.
The question is as follows.</i>

479
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:39,289
Why did I come here this weekend,
and what do I hope to gain?

480
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,878
It says, in very bold letters,

481
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,925
that once we finish, we're to
exchange notebooks with a kiss.

482
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:57,140
Then read each other's answers
and discuss how it makes us feel.

483
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,200
<i>It's killing you, isn't it?</i>

484
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,787
I'm happy for them.
I'm glad for Allan.

485
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,747
It's killing you.

486
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:25,042
Well, it bugs me that he's
in some hotel room with her,

487
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,712
gettin' all gooey with her.

488
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,630
You know, I made
him a better lover.

489
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,925
He didn't even know how to French
kiss. I practically trained him.

490
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:36,137
And it seems like Bad Mood
Betty gets all the benefit

491
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:39,640
while I'm babysitting her kids.

492
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:40,766
Really?

493
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,061
You're the one who said
he was fall-in-love-proof.

494
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,982
I got an idea. Why
don't we go out tonight?

495
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,942
There's a new club
just opened up,

496
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,485
and everybody's
saying how fun it is.

497
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,112
I have to babysit the kids.

498
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,573
Oh, come on! Pat can watch 'em.

499
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:58,576
Couple of hours,
girls' night out.

500
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,578
It'll be fun.

501
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,332
You know, sometimes the
best path to happiness

502
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,000
is just to feign it.

503
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,544
Just to give in to
the illusion of it.

504
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,048
Well, I thought that's what
I was doing with Allan.

505
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,509
- Didn't even know how to French kiss.
- We're goin'.

506
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,889
"It's hard for me to
talk about sex, too.

507
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,683
"Sometimes, it's so hard
to feel calm and quiet

508
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,686
"as you need to be to enjoy sex.

509
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:29,106
"I guess the relaxation part
is the hardest part for me.

510
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,484
"That's why, in Switzerland,

511
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:35,030
"a little, or a
lot, of wine helped.

512
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,909
It relaxed me so I could really
be free to enjoy it all."

513
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,745
"Does this mean I'm not
comfortable with sex.

514
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,955
"if I need wine to make
love more pleasant?

515
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,458
I don't know."

516
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,801
How does that make you feel?

517
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,303
Well, I feel

518
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,681
more aware with
your insecurities.

519
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,976
I'm not sure that
awareness is a feeling.

520
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,270
There's no rule about what
constitutes a feeling.

521
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,106
Yes, it's in those
workbooks that they gave us.

522
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:11,858
It's not about what you think.

523
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,861
It's about how you
emotionally respond.

524
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,200
Being aware of my insecurity
over sex is not a feeling.

525
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:24,286
We're not supposed to judge
each other's reactions.

526
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,456
- It says that.
- I've said several things

527
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,835
specifically about sex

528
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,508
and you haven't really
responded. At all.

529
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,636
And I think I know

530
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:42,514
why, Allan.

531
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,398
You don't desire me.

532
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,944
- That is not true.
- No, you never touch me, and you...

533
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,613
Because you send the
message, "Don't touch me."

534
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,324
The core principle

535
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,329
of this Encounter is honesty.

536
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:14,087
Are you sexually
attracted to me, Allan?

537
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,717
I promise you I am.

538
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:26,099
I am. Hey.

539
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,394
What?

540
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:34,648
I've been so worried and
scared that you don't want me.

541
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,486
That you don't desire me.
That maybe you don't even

542
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:39,445
love me anymore.

543
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,615
Well, that's not true.
I do. I love you.

544
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,408
Betty.

545
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,535
I desire you.

546
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,080
We're here because I desire you.

547
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:51,958
Because I miss you.

548
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:03,845
I'd like to fornicate.

549
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,356
I'd like to.

550
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,918
Body of Christ, given for you.

551
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:23,173
<i>I realized that what I was feeling
was not, "I don't like you,"</i>

552
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,260
<i>but more like, "I don't
feel excited about you</i>

553
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,720
<i>because I'm too used
to the way things are."</i>

554
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,513
Body of Christ, given for you.

555
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,348
<i>I want to share a lot
more of your feelings,</i>

556
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,477
<i>and I want to be able
to share mine with you.</i>

557
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:43,819
<i>When I think of your being gone more,
I remember those times with dread.</i>

558
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,946
Blood of Christ, shed for you.

559
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,072
<i>The aloneness.</i>

560
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,866
Blood of Christ, shed for you.

561
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:52,786
<i>I never really felt fear
for my safety at home alone</i>

562
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,456
<i>but the feeling of being alone</i>

563
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,293
<i>is the worst
possible one to have.</i>

564
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,837
<i>It's like you're
in a dark tunnel,</i>

565
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,591
<i>and you've got a long
ways to go to the light.</i>

566
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:07,801
<i>The light isn't there
till you're home again,</i>

567
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,803
<i>safe and sound.</i>

568
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,725
<i>And sometimes, the times you are
gone made the tunnel very long.</i>

569
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:19,897
In the name of God, I, Allan,
take you, Betty, to be my wife.

570
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:25,527
To have and to hold,
from this day forward.

571
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:29,198
For better or worse,
richer or poorer.

572
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,201
<i>For better or worse,
richer or poorer.</i>

573
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:34,620
For better or worse,
richer or poorer.

574
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,122
To love and to cherish.

575
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:37,957
<i>To love and cherish.</i>

576
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:44,047
Until we are parted by death.

577
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:47,926
This is my solemn vow.

578
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:49,761
This is my solemn vow.

579
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,848
By the power vested in me
by Jesus Christ, our Lord,

580
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,725
it is my sincere pleasure

581
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,144
to re-pronounce you both

582
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,147
as man and wife.

583
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:39,394
- Hi!
- Hey!

584
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:45,859
Hi!

585
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:48,861
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie. You have fun?

586
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,446
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You did?

587
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:52,656
- Hey. Great.
- How was it?

588
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:55,827
- Pat, thanks again.
- Hey, Allan! Yeah, of course. Any time.

589
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:57,536
Hey.

590
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,050
There's my little angel!

591
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,011
How'd she do?

592
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:16,890
She was perfect. Like
little angels are.

593
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,142
Hi.

594
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,186
Here you go.

595
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:22,854
Thank you.

596
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:28,859
Thank you so much for taking
them. I am beyond grateful.

597
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,403
Are you kidding me?
I love having them.

598
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:34,532
Especially since Jenny is
sweeter when Alisa comes over.

599
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,703
I missed you, my little girl.

600
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,538
So, how was it?

601
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,291
It was amazing.

602
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,920
- Yeah?
- It was really great.

603
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:49,838
Great.

604
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,966
I was skeptical. I really was.

605
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,387
But, honest to God,
it was the best thing.

606
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,934
You and Pat, you
should think about it.

607
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:04,145
- Not that you need it or anything.
- All set, honey.

608
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,356
Alright. Here I come.

609
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:10,150
- Thank you again so much.
- Any time.

610
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,277
Any time.

611
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:15,490
Careful.

612
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,284
- Got it?
- Hey.

613
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:26,750
So, it was good, Betty says.

614
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:30,254
Better than I could
have imagined.

615
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,214
I'm glad to hear it.

616
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,925
- I'll call you.
- Yep.

617
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,344
Bye!

618
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,726
Alright. That should do it.

619
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,650
- Thanks again, guys.
- Yeah.

620
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,946
- Thank you for...
- Bye-bye!

621
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:00,910
- Bye!
- Bye, guys.
