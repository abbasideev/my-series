1
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,695
Betty.

2
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,205
What are you doing?

3
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,376
I don't want you to ever see
him again. You can't have him.

4
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,880
It's been over for a long time.

5
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay, I'm not seeing
him. I don't want him.

6
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,427
Well, don't see him again.

7
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,346
I'm telling you.

8
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,557
I won't.

9
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:29,942
Well, I think under the circumstances
that I should just bring Alisa home

10
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,236
and drop her off
after Bible school.

11
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,487
No.

12
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,532
No, I don't wanna
see you anymore.

13
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:40,661
Just keep Alisa.

14
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,664
Take her to the movie.

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,627
Because I don't wanna
look at you again.

16
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,881
You can bring her home tomorrow.

17
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,050
Sure.

18
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,886
Alisa's suit is on the washer.

19
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,684
I'll go get a towel
from the bathroom to...

20
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,729
to wrap it in.

21
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,548
Thank you.

22
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,177
Don't forget
Alisa's peppermints.

23
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:44,183
That's okay. I'm sure that
we have peppermints at home

24
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,602
- that I could give her.
- She likes ours.

25
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,739
I'll give you these.

26
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,298
Betty.

27
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,804
I am so sorry.

28
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
Betty.

29
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,147
You can't have him.

30
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,107
Betty.

31
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,692
You can't have him.

32
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,194
I'm gonna have another baby.

33
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,714
You can't have him.
You can't have him!

34
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,740
- You can't have him!
- Betty! What are you doing?

35
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,039
What are you doing?

36
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,374
I've gotta kill you.

37
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,789
Target.

38
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,819
I don't want him!

39
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,070
Don't want him!

40
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,247
Sorry. I'm sorry.

41
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,322
No. No. No.

42
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,532
Please, please,
please, please, please.

43
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,489
Nothing's changed.

44
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,625
Candy!

45
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,126
Oh, Barbara.

46
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,754
I went to Betty's and
we just got to talkin'

47
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,857
and I looked at my watch and
thought I had enough time

48
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,134
to go to Target to get Father's Day
cards, so I drove all the way to Plano.

49
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,578
But when I got to
the parking lot,

50
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,572
I realized my watch had
stopped, and so I was late.

51
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,098
I didn't even go
in. I'm so upset.

52
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,766
I wanted to see the
kids' puppet show.

53
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,643
And Jenny was just
asking about you.

54
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,105
Well, I'm just gonna have
to make it up to them.

55
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,948
- Candy, where have you been?
- I'm so upset.

56
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,026
I went to Betty's and,
well, we just got to talkin'

57
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,470
and I thought I had enough time
to go get Father's Day cards

58
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,863
at Target. But when I got there,

59
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:57,616
I realized my watch had
stopped and that I was late.

60
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,339
I had to get Alisa's
swimsuit from Betty's,

61
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,996
or I wouldn't have been
late. My watch stopped.

62
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,083
We're taking Alisa with us tonight
to see "The Empire Strikes Back."

63
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,043
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

64
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,979
Well, that reminds me, I
have to go check on the kids.

65
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,463
- Alright.
- Bye.

66
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,188
Hi, Mom!

67
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,690
Hi, Mom.

68
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:53,088
Mom, I like this one. "Hats off
for a wonderful Father's Day."

69
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,798
That sounds great, honey.

70
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,550
"To wish you a
happy Father's Day,

71
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,261
"and then to tell you, too,
there's always lots of love

72
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,054
and pride in every
thought of you."

73
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,515
Great.

74
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,022
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- Wait!

75
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,073
- Come on, Ms. Candy!
- Come on, Mommy!

76
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,306
Girls, can you get your suits on? We
don't wanna be late for Alisa's lesson.

77
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,945
- Hello?
- Pat, hi.

78
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,780
We just got back
from Bible school.

79
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,407
I need you to make sure you
get enough money at the bank

80
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,785
because Alisa is going
to the movies with us.

81
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,330
- You checked with Betty?
- I went to Betty's

82
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,040
to get Alisa's suit,

83
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,709
but we just got to talkin'
and I lost track of time.

84
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,379
And then, I got to the Target,

85
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,382
and I noticed my watch
stopped. And so, I just...

86
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,022
I missed the whole
Bible school program.

87
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,887
So, we'll just meet you at
the parking lot at 15 to 5!

88
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,394
Somebody's here, honey,
so we'll meet you there.

89
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,312
- Okay!
- Okay.

90
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,231
Bye.

91
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,991
- Hey!
- Hi. I'm so sorry.

92
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,450
The day just got away from me.

93
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,577
No worries.

94
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,457
Can I grab it?

95
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,167
What?

96
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,545
- The card table.
- Oh, yes! Yes, of course.

97
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,273
I swear, I don't know
where my head is at.

98
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,799
I got so busy that I even
missed the puppet show.

99
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,634
What's wrong?

100
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,764
Nothing. Nothin'.
I'm just, you know,

101
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,142
going in too many different
directions at once is all.

102
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,895
It's here.

103
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,604
Thanks for the card table!

104
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,402
- Talk to you later, baby.
- Bye!

105
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,780
Welcome to Dallas
International Airport...

106
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,407
Directory assistance,
please, in Wylie, Texas.

107
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,080
- Hello.
- Richard, hi. This is Allan Gore.

108
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,208
- Hey, Allan.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

109
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,835
I'm out of town

110
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,838
and I've been trying
to catch Betty all day.

111
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,716
I think the phones must be
out of order or something.

112
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,319
But would you mind knocking
on the door over there

113
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,845
just to make sure she's home?

114
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,806
Sure I can run over.

115
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,975
Yeah. Hold on a
minute. I'll go check.

116
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,144
Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

117
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,591
No answer, Allan.
She must be out.

118
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,343
Okay.

119
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,845
- Thank you for checking.
- No problem.

120
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,104
I really like your
mom's lasagna.

121
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,731
Thanks! I'll tell her.

122
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,444
- Remember that cute turtle I made?
- Yeah.

123
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,946
- Out of pipe cleaners?
- Yeah.

124
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,368
Hello?

125
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,702
Candy, this is Allan.

126
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,914
Have you seen Betty?

127
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,626
Allan!

128
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,671
- Hi, where are ya?
- I'm in Minnesota on a business trip

129
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,649
but I've been trying to
get ahold of Betty all day

130
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,675
and she's not answering.

131
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,053
And I thought maybe you
talked to her today.

132
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,431
Yes, I saw her this morning when
I went to get Alisa's swimsuit.

133
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,809
Do you happen to know
if she had any plans?

134
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,019
No.

135
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,729
No, but I still have Alisa

136
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,107
'cause there was a change
of plans this morning.

137
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,943
Jenny wanted Alisa to
stay over another night

138
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,445
so they could go to the movies.

139
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,073
Did she seem alright to you?

140
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,575
Yeah! Yeah, she was fine.

141
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,287
You know, I'd be happy to go to the
house and check on them for you.

142
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,164
No, that's okay. I'll
call the neighbors again.

143
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,124
Okay.

144
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,585
Okay, well, just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

145
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,170
- Okay. Thank you. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

146
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,591
What's going on?

147
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,509
Allan's out of town.

148
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,429
He can't get ahold of Betty,
so he's a bit worried.

149
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,313
I'm sure she's okay.

150
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,191
She could be out with friends.

151
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,281
I'm gonna go call her
again, if you'll excuse me.

152
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,483
Richard, I'm really
sorry about this.

153
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,427
Could you run out back
and look in the garage

154
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,804
to see if her car is there?

155
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,015
- Yeah. Yeah, just a sec.
- Okay. Thanks.

156
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,986
She never leaves that
garage door open.

157
00:19:55,403 --> 00:20:01,576
Can you please go back over there,
check all the doors and the garage again

158
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,413
and I want you to get in the
house any way that you can.

159
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,999
- Allan just called.
- Yeah, I guess he's calling everybody.

160
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,211
- Yeah, he called me, too.
- He sounded pretty upset.

161
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,296
Said we should get in
the house any way we can.

162
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,092
Got my realtor keys. We can
try 'em on all the doors.

163
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,110
Oh shit. Hey!

164
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,861
- Yeah?
- It's not locked.

165
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,114
What? Lester!

166
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,289
Betty?

167
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,001
Betty?

168
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,502
Betty?

169
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,890
Betty?

170
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,476
Oh, my God.

171
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,357
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

172
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,986
Hello?

173
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,537
There's nothing here.

174
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,633
The baby.

175
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,595
- Hey! Hey!
- Let's...

176
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,438
- let's get her outta here.
- It's okay. Yes.

177
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,474
I'll take her to my house.

178
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,355
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

179
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:58,735
It's okay. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

180
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,530
It's okay.

181
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,684
Oh God!

182
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,395
Don't go in there.

183
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,940
She's dead.

184
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,942
- What? What!
- She's dead.

185
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,119
What.

186
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,591
- Hello?
- This is Allan.

187
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,303
Oh God. I have to
make a decision.

188
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,556
What? What decision?
What's wrong?

189
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,932
- I don't know...
- It's okay.

190
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,686
Allan? Yeah, it's Jerry.

191
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,022
- What did you find?
- Oh, gosh, it's not good, Allan.

192
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,484
The little one's okay.

193
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,486
- The baby?
- Yeah, she's okay.

194
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,906
What about Betty?

195
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,119
- What about Betty?
- I'm so sorry, Allan.

196
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,792
What? What happened?

197
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,170
I don't know for sure,
but it... Oh God.

198
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,422
It looks like she's been shot.

199
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,051
I'm so sorry, Allan.

200
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,554
I wish there was a better
way to tell you. I do.

201
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,240
Stop. Stop.

202
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,743
- You kidding me?
- Hello?

203
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,286
Candy,

204
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,831
I have some bad news.

205
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,875
Betty's dead.

206
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,836
What?

207
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,424
What happened?

208
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,553
It looks like she's
been shot, apparently.

209
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,555
The neighbors found her.

210
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,225
Oh, my God.

211
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,687
What about Bethany?

212
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,689
We don't even own a gun.

213
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,362
I don't even own a gun.

214
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,324
I don't know what to say.

215
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,494
Could you please keep
Alisa for a while

216
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,497
and don't tell her what
happened? I wanna tell her.

217
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,836
Are you gonna be okay?

218
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,591
Yeah.

219
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,094
Thanks. I've gotta go.

220
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,195
This way, Chief.

221
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,721
Look there.

222
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,813
Looks like one of
them cult deals.

223
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,733
Call the sheriff.

224
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,321
We gotta have backup.
Then call Collin County.

225
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,782
In fact, call everybody.

226
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,786
Whoever did this could be crazy enough
to still be in the neighborhood.

227
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,640
This is Chief Abbott.

228
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,725
This is Allan Gore.

229
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,229
Mr. Gore. I'm Chief
Abbott of the Wylie PD.

230
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:30,024
Can you tell me what you know
about what happened here?

231
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,445
I understand that
Betty's been shot.

232
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,615
That's correct.

233
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:42,787
I've been trying to
reach her all day.

234
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,083
I left for Saint Paul
on business at about

235
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:52,713
4:30. I tried to call her before
I left. She didn't answer.

236
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,968
I kept trying her

237
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:02,306
right up until the
point that they told me.

238
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,518
I understand. And do
you know anybody else

239
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,187
that could have been
around the house today?

240
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:11,274
Well, Candy Montgomery.
She's a friend of ours.

241
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:16,154
She said she came by to pick
up a swimsuit this morning.

242
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,005
Serious?

243
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,300
The goal to contaminate as
much evidence as possible?

244
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,386
Start with the utility room.

245
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,725
Then the bathroom.

246
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,894
It's covered in blood.

247
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,849
Hello?

248
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,309
It's Allan.

249
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,812
My flight doesn't land
till about 10:00 or so.

250
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:35,983
I'm going to go home first. Can
you keep Alisa till 3:00 or so?

251
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,485
Of course.

252
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,031
- And she still doesn't know?
- No. No, we've...

253
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,076
we've kept her away from the
radio or anything like that.

254
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,202
Okay.

255
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,872
I talked to the
police last night

256
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:53,376
and I mentioned you were over there,
so they'll probably be calling you.

257
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:58,172
- That's fine.
- Okay. I'll call you later. Bye.

258
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,382
Okay.

259
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,223
- Hello?
- Have you heard?

260
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,225
Betty Gore's been shot.

261
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,060
She's dead!

262
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,688
Yes, we heard. Yes.

263
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,815
It's all over the news.

264
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,610
Honey, I have Alisa with
us. I should get off.

265
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,755
Listen, when I get all these
relations out of my house,

266
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,882
I'm gonna come over, and we're
gonna drink a pot of coffee

267
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,616
- and talk.
- That is just what I need.

268
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,410
Thank you, honey. I'll
ring if I hear more.

269
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,787
Jesus.

270
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,747
Hello?

271
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,750
It's me, Jo Ann. You
heard Betty's dead?

272
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,379
We heard last night,
yeah. It's so awful.

273
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,672
The police just left.

274
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,799
They say she was
murdered with an axe.

275
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,303
- An axe?
- Yeah.

276
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,347
Must have been some
very sick person.

277
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,022
It looks like from
the pinky finger.

278
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,231
Probably the victim's.

279
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,528
How we doin'?

280
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,739
It was not premeditated.

281
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,034
The weapon's too strange,
signs of a struggle everywhere.

282
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,412
It was a crime of circumstance.

283
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,872
Or sex crime, maybe.

284
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,667
That I can't tell you. The coroner
will have to make that call.

285
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,837
But those footprints in the utility
room do not belong to a man.

286
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,172
They're too small.

287
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,551
Think a woman did
this. A woman or a kid.

288
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:26,028
He's about to step out
of the cab right now

289
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,989
and this would be the first time
that he has been here after...

290
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,843
How'd it happen, Dick?

291
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,344
What all do you know?

292
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,890
Just that she was shot.

293
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,103
Well, that's wrong.

294
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,105
- What happened?
- The weapon was an axe.

295
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,399
And it was very brutal.

296
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,401
Crime lab was here
until 8:00 this morning.

297
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,611
It was all hell to clean up.

298
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,239
I wish there was another
way to say it, to tell you.

299
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,460
- I wasn't here.
- What?

300
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,006
I wasn't here.

301
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:32,970
Betty

302
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:36,557
was always afraid when I go

303
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,602
something would happen.

304
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,734
She always said I should
be here. A husband

305
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,362
should be home.

306
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,450
And I wasn't here.

307
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,569
Come on, sweetie.

308
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,823
Daddy!

309
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,449
Hi, sweetie.

310
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,535
Oh, Allan.

311
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,746
Allan. Oh, I'm so sorry.

312
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,748
I'm so sorry.

313
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,586
Princess! Cheeto!

314
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,090
Is there anything that
we can do for you?

315
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,093
Just please don't leave yet.

316
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,554
I'd like for you to be here

317
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,181
when I tell her. I
think that'd help.

318
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,683
Of course.

319
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,491
Sweetie, can I talk
to you for a minute?

320
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,625
Last night,

321
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,880
somebody very bad
came into the house

322
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,047
and

323
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,469
cut up Mommy very bad and
Mommy's not coming back.

324
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,182
Understand?

325
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,505
She was damn near dismembered
from what I'm told.

326
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,590
Can you imagine?

327
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,426
That's why I always
say, use the deadbolt.

328
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,553
Like she'd been put
through a Veg-O-Matic.

329
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,348
I'd just finished
seeing "The Shining"

330
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,558
when I got the news, if
you can believe that.

331
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:26,352
Talk about bad dreams.

332
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,937
Well, it had to be a drifter.

333
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,315
A weapon like that
during the day in Wylie?

334
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,944
Now, my bet is probably
either sex criminal

335
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,363
or a burglar caught in the
act. And whoever it is,

336
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:40,366
likely a thousand
miles away by now.

337
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,953
Honey, I'm gonna go speak
to Don for a second.

338
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,537
Okay.

339
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,873
It happened Friday,
today's Sunday.

340
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:51,335
After 48 hours, the odds flop.

341
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,922
- Hey, Don. Hi, y'all.
- Hi, Candy.

342
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,549
We're just talking
about it. Awful.

343
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:00,678
Oh, yes. It is.

344
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,473
Can I speak to you in
private for a second?

345
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,685
- Sure.
- If that's alright. Okay. Thanks.

346
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,315
Well, I guess you know that
I was there that mornin'.

347
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:16,694
I was probably the last
one to see her alive.

348
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:22,074
Well, I doubt the last.
Maybe second to last.

349
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,784
Well, yeah, you
know what I mean.

350
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,038
Anyway, I'm supposed to speak
to the police this afternoon,

351
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,541
and is there any reason
that I should be worried?

352
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,961
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

353
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,297
I was the last one seen at the
scene of the crime and everything

354
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,426
and those are always the people
they arrest on the TV shows.

355
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,637
Candy, they talk to everybody
in a case like this.

356
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,642
And the way she was chopped up.

357
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:56,942
Whoever did this had
to be a very big man.

358
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,195
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

359
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,241
- Thanks, Don.
- Sure.

360
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:07,786
Family and friends of the
Gores continue to gather...

361
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,293
My deepest sympathies.

362
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,503
I appreciate that.

363
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,882
Bob's got Bethany
in the bedroom.

364
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,218
I think they both need a
moment away from all this.

365
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,890
What about this Marriage
Encounter thing?

366
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,725
You and Betty went to that?

367
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,061
We did, yes.

368
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,604
Could it be someone from there?

369
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,065
- I'm hearing it's like a cult.
- I don't...

370
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:40,319
It wasn't anyone from Marriage
Encounter. It's not a cult.

371
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,322
Why did you two go there?

372
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,619
They're evidently
doing two services.

373
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:51,038
One here tomorrow and the
other in Norwich on Wednesday.

374
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,750
And get this. Ron will be
performing the ceremony tomorrow.

375
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,085
Ron Adams?

376
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,544
Betty hated him.

377
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,838
I know, but they hadn't
officially rejoined

378
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:04,259
the Wylie Church so, technically,
Ron is still her pastor.

379
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,304
- Oh, my God.
- Candy? Candy.

380
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,973
Some of this food needs to
be put into the freezer.

381
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,745
I'm afraid I can't get
myself to go into that room.

382
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,409
Would you mind taking
it in there for me?

383
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,480
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

384
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,101
Hey! Hey! Stop!

385
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,479
I'm sorry about those dogs.

386
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,482
Anytime anyone comes in this
room, they bark like that.

387
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:07,531
I'm Bertha. I'm
Betty's mother.

388
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,995
I'm so sorry for your loss.

389
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,539
Thank you.

390
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,499
Excuse me.

391
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,353
"Happy Father's Day, honey.

392
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,772
"It really means a lot to
have a husband like you.

393
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:46,403
"A lot of time, a
lot of frustration.

394
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,323
"A lot of headaches,
a lot of worry,

395
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,782
a lot of fun."

396
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:54,077
That's so great. Thank you.

397
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,246
You're welcome.

398
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:00,459
Wow. Look at you.

399
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,963
Oh, well, I'm not sure what one
wears to the police station,

400
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,715
so I figured I might
as well look nice.

401
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,189
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

402
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:13,305
Oh, yeah. I'll drive myself.
They said it shouldn't take long.

403
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,516
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

404
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,902
Well, let's just start
from the beginning.

405
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:12,155
The beginning would have
been vacation Bible school.

406
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,325
And that would have started
about 9:00 in the morning

407
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:21,290
with a service ceremony sort of thing,
where I told one of my parables.

408
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,083
"The Three Trees."

409
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,502
Would you like to hear that?

410
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,922
Oh, no. That's okay.
After the ceremony?

411
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,050
After the ceremony,
I left the church

412
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:36,930
around 9:45, and got to
Betty's around 10:00.

413
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:39,308
What was she doin'?

414
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,643
She'd just put the baby down,

415
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:45,147
and she was drinking
a cup of coffee and

416
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:51,236
sewing something out
of yellow material.

417
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,989
And she was about to
watch "Phil Donahue."

418
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,325
So, after you got there?

419
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:00,495
Yes. We got to chattin' about
what to do with the children.

420
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:05,208
And then, we went and played with the
dogs 'cause they just got a new puppy.

421
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,086
And then, I told her
about this new business

422
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:13,508
that I've started with Sherry Cleckler,
a wallpapering and painting thing.

423
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,595
And then I showed her one of my
cards and she thought that was cute.

424
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,764
And maybe I can leave
some for you all.

425
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,809
After you showed her
your business card?

426
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:27,689
I went into the utility
room to get Alisa's suit

427
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,984
and Betty went to grab
a towel to wrap it in.

428
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,781
And then she handed me
some peppermint candies

429
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:39,284
because Alisa doesn't like to
put her head under the water.

430
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:44,956
And so, she sort of just
bribes her with the candies.

431
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,543
What did you have
on, clothes-wise?

432
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,630
I was wearing a burgundy
blouse and blue jeans.

433
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,800
What about shoes?

434
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,219
We picked up some
footprints in the hallway

435
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,138
and we need to screen the
prints for people we know

436
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,973
who were in the house.

437
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,394
I was wearing my
blue tennis shoes.

438
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,646
- Rubber soles?
- Yes.

439
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:10,440
Do you have those shoes?

440
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:13,318
Not with me but I
could get them for you.

441
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:16,613
How long do you think you
were in there, in total?

442
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,409
About 15 minutes.

443
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,495
And after?

444
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,833
After, I went to Target in
Plano to get Father's Day cards

445
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,127
but I noticed my watch stopped.

446
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,212
It still said 10:15.

447
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,632
And so, I asked someone what time
it was, and they said it was 11:10,

448
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,634
meaning I was already
late for the puppet show.

449
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,137
And so, I drove
straight to the church

450
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,305
and got there around
11:30 for the luncheon.

451
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:47,644
And I didn't know that anything
was wrong until about 8:30

452
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,479
when Allan called me to tell me

453
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:52,274
that he was having a hard
time getting ahold of Betty.

454
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:11,585
I'm not saying cancel it altogether.
Just, you know, postpone it some.

455
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:16,131
Yes, I realize that they
wanna go and we will.

456
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,009
It's just under
the circumstances,

457
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:22,012
it's not the best time to
go to Six Flags, that's all.

458
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,853
Not just that she was a
popular school teacher,

459
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,022
but, bear in mind, this
is the first murder

460
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:35,358
of any kind in
Wylie in 25 years.

461
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,944
That it was committed with an
axe against an innocent woman

462
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:40,489
in her own home in
a nice neighborhood,

463
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,283
you can understand why this
whole community is on edge.

464
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:49,831
She was a loving mother, a loyal
wife, a committed person of faith.

465
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,293
How can a thing like this happen

466
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,671
to a person who is so
needed by her family?

467
00:45:58,215 --> 00:46:00,967
A mother so needed
by her children.

468
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,970
A daughter so loved
by her parents.

469
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,443
Perhaps there will be
those who look to God

470
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:10,811
and say that He has some
eternal purpose in all of this.

471
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,814
I cannot accept that.

472
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:18,485
The notion that God would will
something like this upon anyone.

473
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,489
This was not God's will.

474
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:28,078
His will has been thwarted by the
actions and behavior of humanity.

475
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,789
Humanity seems too kind a word.

476
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,250
A monster.

477
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,294
When things like this happen,

478
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:41,091
God's will and purposes then
change to His ultimate will.

479
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:44,302
This act was unnatural.

480
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,805
It was evil.

481
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:54,521
I'm sorry, but I feel
like we've been over this.

482
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:58,567
Well, with me, you have, but I
want these boys to hear it as well.

483
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:03,321
But we're trying to be as
painstaking as possible.

484
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,533
I appreciate that.

485
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,743
How were things
with your marriage?

486
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,413
- They were good.
- Yeah? She was secure in it?

487
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,460
There was a time
when she wasn't.

488
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,047
You know, we've

489
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:28,263
we had our issues,
specifically over the travel.

490
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:33,476
She battled postpartum
depression, which was a strain,

491
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,271
but things were
improving of late.

492
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:40,942
We'd gone to a church program
called Marriage Encounter

493
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:44,112
and things were improving.

494
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,866
So you can't think of anybody
that'd wanna hurt your wife?

495
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,077
No. She didn't have any enemies,

496
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,287
or...

497
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:57,667
She wasn't too popular at
her school with her students.

498
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:02,255
One time, our house was
vandalized, but I can't imagine

499
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,799
that.

500
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,303
If I could go back a second.

501
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:13,308
You said that on Friday evening,
and then again on Saturday,

502
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,061
you had several conversations
with Candy Montgomery?

503
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,104
Yes.

504
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:20,607
- She told you she was at the house?
- Yes.

505
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,984
What else she tell you?

506
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,364
That Betty seemed fine.

507
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:33,745
Now, I apologize for having to ask
this, but can you think of a time

508
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,539
where Betty might have had
an affair with another man?

509
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,256
Yes, in 1971.

510
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,093
We were living in Las Cruces.

511
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,805
It was a time when
I was traveling.

512
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:55,558
She had a one-night stand
with a college student there

513
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,352
at New Mexico State.

514
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,606
I don't believe she
ever had another affair

515
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:05,735
with any other man since then.

516
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:09,030
Pretty sure about that?

517
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,782
Yes.

518
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,575
You ever had an affair yourself?

519
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,369
No.

520
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:21,584
Have anything else you wanna tell us
that could help us in the investigation?

521
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,379
I can't think of anything
at this time. No.

522
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,697
Hello?

523
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:55,452
Chief Abbott? It is
Allan Gore calling.

524
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,997
I'm sorry to disturb you.

525
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:02,208
I was just calling

526
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,216
to let you know that there was one
thing I was not truthful about.

527
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,677
What's that, Allan?

528
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:18,391
I did have an affair.

529
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,439
With Candy Montgomery.
