1
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,620
Are the kids awake?

2
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,624
Are the kids awake? Candy,
it's 6:30 in the morning.

3
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,587
Are you alright?

4
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,285
Yeah, why wouldn't I be alright?

5
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,968
<i>Did Mrs. Montgomery ever
mention getting a divorce?</i>

6
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,972
She mentioned it once.

7
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,182
She said

8
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,727
maybe when her kids were
grown, that she still had

9
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:25,812
a life to lead and...

10
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,107
- A life to lead with you?
- No.

11
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,860
No, that was never...

12
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,195
We never contemplated a future.

13
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,824
I loved Betty, and
Candy knew that.

14
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,778
Did your wife ever find out
you were having an affair?

15
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,332
If she did, she never
let on. I don't think so.

16
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,252
Did you kill your wife?

17
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,754
No.

18
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,131
Do you know who did?

19
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,469
No.

20
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,596
Mr. Gore, at this
time, we're gonna have

21
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,932
to read you your legal
rights as prescribed by law.

22
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,934
You have the right
to remain silent.

23
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,186
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

24
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,480
in a court of law. You have
a right to an attorney.

25
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,899
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided to you.

26
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,153
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

27
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:38,844
Hello?

28
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,553
<i>Mrs. Montgomery?</i>

29
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,139
Yeah, Chief Abbott here.

30
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:46,267
- Oh, hi.
- <i>Sorry to bother you at home.</i>

31
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,560
<i>Listen,</i>

32
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,231
we had a couple more
questions and so forth.

33
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,899
Wondering if you could
just pop back in here

34
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,902
if it's not too much
of an imposition.

35
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,697
It's just routine.

36
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,908
We need to take your prints,
so we can screen out the prints

37
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,036
of family and friends who
were in the house that day.

38
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,122
Okay.

39
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,417
Sure are a lot of
folks here today.

40
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,919
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,553
So, you made mention of

42
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:22,888
a "Marriage Encounter"?

43
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:28,852
Yes, well, we mainly went because
Allan and Betty swore by it.

44
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,520
As did the Garlingtons.

45
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,024
Very big on communication,
expressing your feelings,

46
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,443
and so forth.

47
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,987
Yeah.

48
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,990
Do you know if Betty Gore
was having an affair?

49
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,411
No.

50
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,205
No, I wouldn't know about that.

51
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,747
Do you know whether Allan
Gore was having an affair?

52
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,753
No.

53
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,797
What about you and your husband?

54
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,425
Have either of you had
any outside affairs?

55
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,718
Pat wouldn't do that.

56
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,262
But you would?

57
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,142
I did.

58
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:09,976
You did?

59
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,688
With who?

60
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,903
I had an affair with Allan Gore.

61
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,872
You murdered Betty
Gore, didn't you?

62
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,832
No, I didn't.

63
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,959
I think you did.

64
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,755
You're wrong.

65
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,716
You seem pretty
composed in your denial.

66
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,052
Most people get
accused of murder,

67
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,555
they react with hysterics.
You're cool as a cucumber.

68
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,645
Betty Gore was your friend.

69
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,859
You slept with her husband and
then you cut her up with an axe.

70
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,697
You just chopped and chopped
and chopped and chopped on her

71
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,492
and then you sit here
and lie to us about it.

72
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,579
You make me so sick, I can't even stay
in the same room with you anymore.

73
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:17,752
Well.

74
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,145
You know, my grandfather
always used to say,

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,725
"Sometimes in a bad situation, all
you can do is make the best of it."

76
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,114
I think the best thing
that you can do here,

77
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,730
Mrs. Montgomery,

78
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,358
is tell us the truth.

79
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,570
I didn't murder her.

80
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,030
I didn't do it.

81
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,868
Well, I think you did.

82
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,288
And I think a jury
might think you did.

83
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,166
If I show 'em this fingerprint,

84
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,627
and I tell 'em it's your print,
and I show 'em the footprints

85
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,131
- in Betty Gore's house...
- They're gonna think I did it, too.

86
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,176
But, I didn't.

87
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,763
You care if we
looked over your car?

88
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,309
No.

89
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,034
You're tryin' to pin something
on me and that's not right.

90
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,411
You're tryin' to manipulate me
to admit something I didn't do.

91
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,872
Those sandals?

92
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,541
Mind if we kept those
shoes for a while?

93
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,127
No.

94
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,638
Appreciate if we could have
the shoes you're wearing, too.

95
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,822
This is not fair
what you're doin'.

96
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,712
<i>They actually came right
out and accused you?</i>

97
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,048
And they weren't very
nice about it either.

98
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,592
- Jesus.
- Honey.

99
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,221
Tell him about the affair.

100
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,557
Go ahead.

101
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,726
Hold on. Hold on.

102
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,980
Before we say anything else,
you need to retain me as counsel

103
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,148
so we have
attorney-client privilege.

104
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,609
Pat, write me out a check.
Doesn't matter what it's for.

105
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,612
- $100, and put the date and time on it.
- Okay.

106
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,115
And do it outside
in the outer office.

107
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,492
- I need to talk to Candy alone.
- Why?

108
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,910
Because I do.

109
00:08:55,911 --> 00:09:00,082
Just wait outside or drive
around for 10 or 15 minutes.

110
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,792
Okay.

111
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,555
What affair?

112
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,100
I had an affair with Allan Gore.

113
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:23,564
But it's over. It has been
over for eight months.

114
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,691
Did Betty know about that?

115
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,321
It seems she might have. She
brought it up. On the day.

116
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,537
Did the police read
you your rights?

117
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,830
No.

118
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,166
I'm gonna pay a little visit
to the police on process.

119
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,418
Meantime, I want you to call
all the women at church.

120
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,837
Everyone who saw you at
Bible school last Friday,

121
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,964
ask them if they remember
what you were wearin'.

122
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,633
What? Why?

123
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,134
For you to have done
what they're suggesting,

124
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,635
you'd have had
blood all over you.

125
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,305
I wanna establish a record
that you looked normal,

126
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,390
and you'd be surprised how
fast memories can fade,

127
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,392
- so do this today.
- Don.

128
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,477
Just do it, Candy.

129
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,896
And if you can pass a
private polygraph test,

130
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,982
we might be able to
clear this up right away.

131
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:14,364
And no communication whatsoever
going forward with Allan Gore.

132
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,784
We don't know what
he's saying or to who.

133
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,994
You do not talk to him.

134
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:24,416
He leaves for Kansas today anyway.
There's another service tomorrow.

135
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,394
Yes, sir.

136
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,939
No, I wouldn't...

137
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,942
I wouldn't have a
problem with that.

138
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,908
I don't have anything to say
that I haven't already told you.

139
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,537
I understand.

140
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,001
Yes, sir.

141
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,297
Thank you.

142
00:11:58,302 --> 00:11:59,761
What's going on?

143
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,764
Is there some place where we
can go and talk in private,

144
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,099
you, me, and Bertha?

145
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,436
Sure. Come over here.

146
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,276
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

147
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,197
I had

148
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,701
an affair with a woman.

149
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,830
And it wasn't

150
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,668
anything. She didn't
mean anything to me.

151
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,213
It's over now.

152
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,968
It's been over for
more than six months.

153
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,016
My God, Allan. How could you?

154
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,607
The reason I'm telling you this

155
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,486
is because I've
talked to the police

156
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,445
and...

157
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:04,701
they tell me she is a
suspect in the murder.

158
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,663
The woman you had
an affair with?

159
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,872
Yes.

160
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,088
Her name is Candy Montgomery,
and she was the woman.

161
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,966
They think she did it?

162
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,803
It seems so.

163
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,348
Has she been arrested?

164
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,392
No, I don't...

165
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,687
Honey, can you please just
give us a few more minutes?

166
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,280
From what I understand,
she is the main suspect.

167
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:50,454
<i>But these recent developments have
the quiet Dallas suburb on edge.</i>

168
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,248
<i>No evidence of a break-in,</i>

169
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,834
<i>you'll recall there was
no sign of forced entry.</i>

170
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,336
<i>And we've been told the police
consider it more than likely</i>

171
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>that Betty Gore was murdered
by someone she knew.</i>

172
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,843
<i>And now, an Eyewitness News
report on the recent...</i>

173
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:08,889
It's in the papers, too.
"Female friend of Allan Gore."

174
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,851
What are the
lawyers tellin' her?

175
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,646
She hasn't said.

176
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,939
She say anything to you?

177
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,317
No.

178
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,571
It's okay. I'll get it.

179
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,365
Thank you.

180
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,619
I'll get it.

181
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,752
- May I help you?
- Hi.

182
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm looking for
Candy Montgomery.

183
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,465
- A reporter from where?
- "The Times Herald."

184
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,134
And there's stuff on the
television, in the newspapers.

185
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,845
The police are clearly
talkin' to the media.

186
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,389
This is gonna get rougher
before it gets better.

187
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,516
I think a little media
prep would be a good idea.

188
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,935
Can you come to my house?

189
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,979
Yeah. When?

190
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,523
- Like, right now.
- I'm on my way.

191
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,490
<i>The police aren't
exactly sharing,</i>

192
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:53,245
but I can't believe they
really think you did it.

193
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,081
And I don't think you did it.

194
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,875
That said,

195
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,004
there are three people in the
world you should never lie to.

196
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,923
Your pastor, your doctor,

197
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,427
and your lawyer. So

198
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,929
don't lie to me, Candy. Okay?

199
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,473
Okay.

200
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,477
I think you know who did do it.

201
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,605
I think you're
covering up somethin'.

202
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,067
Who are you covering for?

203
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,528
No one.

204
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,782
Candy.

205
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:41,125
The truth has a way of comin' out,
and I need to be prepared for it

206
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,544
if I'm gonna do you any good.

207
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,131
Did you walk in on somethin'?

208
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,383
And get scared?

209
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,302
No.

210
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,262
Candy.

211
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:53,929
Allan didn't do it.

212
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,765
- You're sure?
- Positive.

213
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,017
How can you be positive?

214
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,400
Because I did it.

215
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
What?

216
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:09,987
I did it.

217
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,285
I don't believe you.

218
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,623
She came at me.

219
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,584
So, I did it.

220
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,767
Pat doesn't know?

221
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,978
Of course not.

222
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,564
What would he do
if you told him?

223
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,277
I don't know. He's a very

224
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,153
honest person.

225
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,281
He might tell the
police for my own good.

226
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,826
Then, you definitely
do not tell Pat.

227
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:00,079
You understand?
You tell nobody.

228
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,208
The only person you talk
to about this is me.

229
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,719
Also, you should know.

230
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,097
I talk a pretty good game
in the church parking lot

231
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:22,018
but I've never tried a
criminal case in my life.

232
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,437
I'm a personal injury guy.

233
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,401
You're gonna need an
experienced criminal attorney.

234
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,486
Now, I got a young kid.
His name is Robert Udashen.

235
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,904
Smart as hell.

236
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:37,242
But, we may need to get somebody

237
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,535
beyond that even.

238
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,038
Somebody big. 'Cause
this here is...

239
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,835
No, I want someone that
I can trust. I want you.

240
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,963
Candy, you need a real
criminal attorney.

241
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,090
I want you.

242
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,217
Do you know who caused
your wife's death?

243
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,845
- No.
- You went outside to pet the dog?

244
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,139
They just got a new puppy, yes.

245
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,683
On or about June 13th, 1980,

246
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,935
are you yourself the one who
caused your wife's death?

247
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:05,936
No.

248
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,521
After you pet the puppy,

249
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,566
you went into the utility
room to get Alisa's swimsuit?

250
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,776
- Yes.
- At the time your wife was killed,

251
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,029
were you physically
present in the home?

252
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,781
- No.
- Is that when you cut your foot?

253
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,783
In the utility room?

254
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,536
Did you plan or set up with
anyone to have your wife killed?

255
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,537
No.

256
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,082
Did you cut your foot
in the utility room?

257
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,168
I don't wanna talk about that.

258
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,753
- No.
- I don't wanna talk

259
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,505
about anything that
happened in that room.

260
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,424
No.

261
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,890
I don't like that
you're smoking again.

262
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,603
Well, if someone accused
you of chopping up a person

263
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,731
with an axe, you would
maybe smoke, too.

264
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:05,913
Hey, what happened...

265
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,376
to that pair of thongs
that you used to wear?

266
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,254
I gave those to the police.

267
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,714
No, not, not those.
The other pair.

268
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,429
I don't know. I threw them away.

269
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,684
When?

270
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,396
A while ago. I don't know.

271
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,152
Why are you being so
curious all of a sudden?

272
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,325
Maybe if I'd been a little
more curious before,

273
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,995
we wouldn't be in
this situation.

274
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,456
What's that supposed to mean?

275
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,127
It's supposed to mean
what it means, Candy.

276
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,510
I don't like this tone.

277
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:06,181
I'm wondering if she's maybe got
some split personality or something.

278
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,892
Have you seen signs
of that before?

279
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,893
Never.

280
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,358
She's like the most normal
person on the planet.

281
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,946
Word is Allan Gore
passed his polygraph.

282
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,074
What are they waitin' for then?

283
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,078
I don't know.

284
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,665
I'm also hearing that Betty
was universally unliked.

285
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,669
At the church. At the
school where she taught.

286
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:40,216
They could still be running down leads,
going through the process of elimination.

287
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,927
Come on.

288
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,389
Eliminating people who'd
wanna take an axe to her?

289
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,600
How long can the list be?

290
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,315
<i>Do people actually think
that I'm involved in this?</i>

291
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,988
Of course, they don't. The people
in this town know you, Candy.

292
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,076
And they know that
the idea of you...

293
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,037
It's ridiculous.

294
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,830
Even Pat.

295
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,711
But you know that I'm
innocent, don't you?

296
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,549
- Of course, I do.
- No, I couldn't do that.

297
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,396
- Hello?
- <i>Candy.</i>

298
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,398
I'm afraid it's happenin'.

299
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,360
They just issued a
warrant for your arrest.

300
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,863
<i>Are you there?</i>

301
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,283
- Yeah, I'm here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

302
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,246
I'm passin' the phone to
Robert. You do as he says.

303
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,833
<i>Candy,</i>

304
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,877
after we hang up, get yourself
to Don's office right away.

305
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,673
We wanna have positive control
over the surrender, okay?

306
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,800
Where's Pat?

307
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,344
At work.

308
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,387
<i>Okay, call him.</i>

309
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,347
The bond will be
set for $100,000.

310
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,142
<i>That means you'll need to
come up with $10,000 today</i>

311
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,519
<i>to avoid you being put in jail.</i>

312
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,688
<i>We're in the process of
tracking down a bail bondsman</i>

313
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,109
but we need to have all that in
place before we turn you in, okay?

314
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,986
Yeah.

315
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,488
<i>Alright.</i>

316
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,836
If anything, this just shows
how desperate they are.

317
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,049
You are low-hanging
fruit, that's all.

318
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,723
<i>Our top story today
is local housewife</i>

319
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,475
<i>Candace Lynn Montgomery is
being sought this afternoon</i>

320
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,688
<i>after being charged with murder in
the hacking death of Betty Gore...</i>

321
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,861
Are they gonna
put Mommy in jail?

322
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,951
We know Mommy,
and we love Mommy.

323
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,579
We know she didn't do it.

324
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,915
We...

325
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,335
We all love her.

326
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,253
She lives here, for God's sake,

327
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,797
and she's been under
investigation for a week.

328
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,842
If she wanted to run, she
woulda done it already.

329
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,262
- Robert, judge's clerk on three!
- Alright. Just...

330
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,473
I'm sorry. Give me one moment.

331
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,682
Hello?

332
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,479
Good. You're here.

333
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,648
Why don't you wait
in the kitchen

334
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,025
while we sort this bond
business? It could take a while.

335
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,778
I got Judge Ryan's clerk
calling. He wants her there now.

336
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,488
Well, he's not gettin' her now.

337
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,199
He doesn't even have
jurisdiction yet.

338
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,272
Could you take her
in the kitchen?

339
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,040
You okay?

340
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,375
- Fine.
- Okay. Come on.

341
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,086
<i>We were told Mrs. Montgomery
would be surrendering herself</i>

342
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,629
<i>but that hasn't happened yet.</i>

343
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,548
Now, Mrs. Montgomery has
no prior arrest record,

344
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,093
has a stellar reputation
in the community,

345
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,220
and is an active member
in the local church,

346
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:17,307
which makes bail a possibility, even
in a gruesome murder such as this.

347
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,395
We are not delaying, Your Honor. We're
just having a problem with the bond,

348
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,772
which should resolve
itself any moment.

349
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:27,693
Look, given the hour, maybe it makes sense
to bring Mrs. Montgomery in the morning.

350
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,195
<i>Oh, bullshit. I don't give
a damn how late the hour is.</i>

351
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,447
<i>Get Crowder on the
phone in a hurry!</i>

352
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,616
Yes, sir.

353
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,868
He'd like to speak to you.

354
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,371
It's Judge Ryan.

355
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,002
How we doin', Judge?

356
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,878
<i>Crowder, what the hell
you trying to pull?</i>

357
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,298
- We're working on the bond.
- <i>Bullshit.</i>

358
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,008
And what do you even care?

359
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,677
This is not in your
court or any court.

360
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,972
This is still a sheriff's matter.
We will have her up there.

361
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,390
<i>Well, you better.</i>

362
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,271
<i>Like, right now if you
know what's good for you.</i>

363
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,437
Fat fuck.

364
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,984
Hey, we better get her up there.

365
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,154
Pissing off a district
judge is not what we need.

366
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:18,578
You go and I'll stay here and
lock down the bond. Fat fuck.

367
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,875
Candy.

368
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,253
I made cookies.

369
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,422
It's time.

370
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,137
So, why isn't Don coming?

371
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,140
It's a bit "all hands on deck."

372
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,391
This will just be
an arraignment.

373
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,853
You won't have to do
anything or say anything.

374
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:48,607
We'll enter a plea of not guilty,
have a brief discussion of bail.

375
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,025
We should be in and
out in 20 minutes.

376
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,402
Okay.

377
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,196
Oh, shit.

378
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:54,906
What's all this?

379
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,368
This would be us.

380
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,245
Oh, my God.

381
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,248
What's gonna happen?

382
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:09,002
Say nothing and stick by my side.
I'm gonna pull into the sally port,

383
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,587
and they'll close the door down

384
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,868
- after the public. Okay?
- Okay.

385
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,366
- Just do not open your door.
- Okay.

386
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:40,784
Follow me.

387
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,339
Candace Lynn Montgomery?

388
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,049
You are under arrest.

389
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,350
You're under arrest for
the offense of murder.

390
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,636
You have the right
to remain silent.

391
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,637
Are you kidding me?

392
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,140
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

393
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,501
You have the right
to an attorney.

394
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,646
- No, you can't go with her.
- What? Why not?

395
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,649
You gotta go through
the main entrance.

396
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,108
Don't talk to anybody!

397
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,728
Take off your shirt
and hand it to me.

398
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,095
Alright, now take off your
pants, and hand them to me.

399
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,903
Now, take off your bra.

400
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,514
<i>They fucked us.</i>

401
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,140
She's in jail!?

402
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,391
They wouldn't accept our bond.

403
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,895
Don, Don, you told me
you would get her out.

404
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,730
- <i>Pat.</i>
- You told me!

405
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:37,442
Robert negotiated the terms of
surrender with the sheriff and the DA.

406
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,277
<i>They didn't do what
we agreed to do.</i>

407
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,820
Why? Why the hell not?

408
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,907
Because they're assholes, and they
wanted to make a grand showing.

409
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:47,118
<i>The bond came from Dallas
County. Technically,</i>

410
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,828
they have the right to refuse

411
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,914
an out-of-county bond,
and that's what they did.

412
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,124
Oh, my God!

413
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,754
<i>We will have her out first
thing, I promise you.</i>

414
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,839
They want a war?
We'll give it to 'em.

415
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,219
<i>She reportedly was having an affair
with Betty Gore's husband, Allan Gore.</i>

416
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,681
<i>She was also the last person
to see Betty Gore alive.</i>

417
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:11,059
<i>And we're being told the bloody
thumbprint from the freezer door</i>

418
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,229
<i>is a match with the suspect.</i>

419
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,525
<i>Be with me.</i>

420
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,403
- Elaine?
- Hey, Allan.

421
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:04,864
I'm dropping off.

422
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,491
The food, remember? I called.

423
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,451
It's my turn tomorrow,

424
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,995
- but I'll be out of town.
- Yes, yes.

425
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,373
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

426
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,753
Well, I'll leave you to it.

427
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,423
<i>Anyone who has looked at this crime
for more than five minutes knows</i>

428
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,592
<i>it had to be performed by a man.</i>

429
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,386
<i>Candy Montgomery couldn't
even lift an axe like that,</i>

430
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,679
<i>much less swing it.</i>

431
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,348
What do you think happened then?

432
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,308
Well, we got a number of
people we're investigating.

433
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,268
I'm not at liberty
to use any names,

434
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,103
but I'll say this right now.

435
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,816
The case against Candy Montgomery
is one big pile of wet hooey.

436
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,694
I'm not sure talking to the
media like that is a good idea.

437
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,946
The police are talkin'.
We need to keep pace.

438
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,407
It could backfire.

439
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,058
Are you lookin' at
these newspapers?

440
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,499
She's suddenly
the Scarlet Woman!

441
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,834
The brazen, axe-wielding hussy!

442
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,879
If we don't stay ahead of that,

443
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,923
she's gonna be as
good as convicted

444
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,634
by the time we call
the first witness!

445
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,186
Candace Montgomery surrendered
to authorities last night

446
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,522
with a curious,
bewildering smile.

447
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:23,233
<i>She had been a suspect
for more than a week.</i>

448
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:25,485
<i>Her lawyer and the
Collin County DA</i>

449
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:28,780
<i>struck an agreement allowing
her to turn herself in.</i>

450
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:32,117
<i>Bond was set at $100,000.</i>

451
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,660
<i>Here's the thing about trials.</i>

452
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,661
They're fuck-fests.

453
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,622
Both sides trying to
fuck each other over.

454
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,666
It's not cat and mouse,
it's not a chess game,

455
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,960
and it's not civil.

456
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,170
I'm not going to go gently
on them and, full disclosure,

457
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,339
I won't be treading
lightly on you.

458
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,466
If we're gonna win this,
I need to take over,

459
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,469
and you need to do
everything I tell you.

460
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,180
- Okay.
- First thing, lose some weight.

461
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,225
I want you as small as possible.

462
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:00,103
I'm not exactly sure what my
legal strategy will be yet,

463
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,063
but I want the full
menu available,

464
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,149
including, "Look
how tiny she is.

465
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,528
"She couldn't possibly have overtaken
Betty Gore and swung an axe that big."

466
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,947
You also need to
change your hair.

467
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,282
Somethin' more conservative.

468
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,285
I'll choose your wardrobe.

469
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,579
And this is a big one.

470
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,375
No matter how tough you think you
are, I don't want you acting tough.

471
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,962
I'll be the tough guy. You'll
be the mousy housewife.

472
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,799
The mother. The singer
in the church choir.

473
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,594
Speaking of that, no
more in that choir

474
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:35,722
- till after this is over.
- That choir is my salvation.

475
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,724
Pick another one.

476
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,685
You are being very
aggressive with me.

477
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,562
You're damn right I am.

478
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,107
I don't feel I got the
whole picture here.

479
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,567
There's the Candy
Montgomery I know,

480
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,527
and the one who
chopped up Betty Gore.

481
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,865
She. Came. At me!

482
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,996
Robert thinks it's a good idea for
you to meet with a psychiatrist.

483
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,582
His name is Dr. Fred
Fason, outta Houston.

484
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,043
Houston? I can't go to Houston!

485
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,628
Yes, you can!

486
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,046
For me to help you,

487
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,549
I need to know exactly
what I'm dealing with.

488
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,676
Which, right now, I don't.

489
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,641
He also wants to change venue.

490
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,268
He thinks Galveston.

491
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,062
Galveston?

492
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,481
Or Port Arthur. Just

493
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,609
someplace where people
are more used to murder.

494
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,695
Okay.

495
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,657
What's he saying about
the case? The strategy?

496
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,785
He doesn't want me
to talk about it.

497
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,536
What do you mean?

498
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,289
He doesn't want me
to talk about it.

499
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,417
- Not even with me?
- No, not with anyone.

500
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,254
And honestly, Pat, I don't
want to. I'm so tired.

501
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,842
I'm just gonna turn this whole
matter over to God and Don

502
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,010
and just not talk about
it with anybody else.

503
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,138
Candy, I am your husband.
You need to talk to me.

504
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,141
Do you know what I need?

505
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,977
I need to follow
my lawyer's advice.

506
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:07,940
He's in charge. Don
Crowder. And God.

507
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,153
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not doing too good.

508
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,798
I know, baby. And I'm sorry.

509
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,509
I'm sorry.

510
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,848
We will get through this.

511
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,477
I'm not exactly sure
how, but we will.

512
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,692
<i>She's gonna need the support
of this congregation.</i>

513
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,986
I still can't believe it.

514
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,530
Every worshipper here is a
potential character witness

515
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,284
and knows the idea of her
doing this is bullshit.

516
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,328
And Ron...

517
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:06,040
<i>- it ain't just gonna be Candy.</i>
- What do you mean?

518
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,834
This church will
be put on trial.

519
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,462
Lucas Methodist will never
survive a murder conviction

520
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,297
against one of its congregants.

521
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,341
But

522
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,885
we just built our new sanctuary.

523
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,263
God knows Candy
couldn't have done this.

524
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,225
The congregation needs to
understand that God knows this.

525
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,645
<i>The pastor is the one
that needs to tell 'em.</i>

526
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,105
I understand.

527
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,651
<i>The courtroom is already packed
with those lucky enough to get in.</i>

528
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:37,820
Of course, the lawyers and
members of the media are present,

529
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,908
but one person not in that room today
is the defendant, Candy Montgomery.

530
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:45,453
For pretrial motions, in
this case, change of venue,

531
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,288
her attendance is not required.

532
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,958
And we're being told that
not only is she not here,

533
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,919
she's not even in
the jurisdiction.

534
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:55,755
Alright now. Before we get
to the matter of venue,

535
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,715
y'all better listen to me.

536
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,884
Been a little too much
jabberin' by both sides

537
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,594
to the newspapers and whatnot.

538
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:06,057
I don't wanna see or hear or
read anything in the media

539
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,227
that has Don Crowder's name to
it, Robert Udashen's name to it,

540
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,979
Tom O'Connell's, Jack Pepper,

541
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,731
anyone involved in the
prosecution of this case.

542
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,692
And if I do,

543
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,194
I'ma put you in jail.

544
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,529
And then you're gonna
have to try your lawsuit

545
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,863
from a cell block.

546
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,700
Show's over, gentlemen.

547
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:25,911
And if you want to test me,

548
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,037
I invite it.

549
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,458
Now, on venue.

550
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:36,921
Mr. Crowder, I've seen your
papers, and I am not impressed.

551
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,216
Actually, Judge, those
papers are meant to be read.

552
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,760
If you look closely,
you'll see words on 'em,

553
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,222
arranged in a
particular order, even.

554
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,394
- What are you doing?
- I'm not gonna let him walk all over us.

555
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,395
Fat fuck.

556
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,525
I've already got half a mind to
bounce you from this whole deal.

557
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,193
On what grounds?

558
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,154
On the grounds you're
outta your league some.

559
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,657
What business do you have
taking on a criminal case,

560
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,159
especially one of
this magnitude?

561
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,788
I'm here because my client
hired me. As is her right.

562
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:13,416
Maybe we could kick off
with that little refresher.

563
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,044
Criminal defendants get rights.

564
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,087
- Tread carefully, Mr. Crowder.
- Come on, Don.

565
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,173
This trial should not be
held in Collin County.

566
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,217
I would think you'd beg for
it. Folks here might know

567
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,678
your client to have a
modicum of goodness.

568
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,599
To the rest of the nation,
she's an axe murderer.

569
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,641
And what is she to you, Judge?

570
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,811
I just call balls and strikes.

571
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:35,313
And it's strike one
on you right now.

572
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,982
The defense called a
total of seven witnesses,

573
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,235
submitted nine sworn affidavits,
and, without exception,

574
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,238
they all testified that every
living, breathing person

575
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,242
in Collin County with access
to a radio, TV, or newspaper

576
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,787
thinks Candy Montgomery
to be guilty of murder.

577
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,081
<i>In the end, Judge Ryan felt
that they would be able</i>

578
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:56,835
<i>to ignore their preconceived opinions,
and he denied the motion to change venue.</i>

579
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:01,048
<i>I'm not running a beauty
pageant. I'm not running for God.</i>

580
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,009
<i>I'm Tom Ryan.</i>

581
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,473
Don doesn't like him one bit,
and I'm beginnin' to see why.

582
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,235
What is this trip
to Houston about?

583
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,197
They want her to meet
with some psychiatrist.

584
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,907
I don't, I don't
know exactly why.

585
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,118
Well, what's Candy tellin' you?

586
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,120
She doesn't wanna talk about it.

587
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:35,164
That doesn't make sense, Pat.

588
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,584
I don't wanna put
pressure on her.

589
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,549
Is she guilty of this?

590
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,758
No.

591
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,137
- No.
- You have doubts.

592
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,347
Questions, maybe.

593
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,558
- Like?
- Like,

594
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,685
why would she throw
away her thongs?

595
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,312
Why can't she discuss
the case with me?

596
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,814
And

597
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,066
why did she have cuts
and bruises all over her?

598
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,110
Did you ask her
about those things?

599
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,821
No, I can't. Any time I...

600
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,909
What'd I miss?

601
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,998
I don't understand why you
have to be so secretive.

602
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,710
Oh gosh, I told you, Pat.

603
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,712
It's because the lawyers
want it that way.

604
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,380
Candy!

605
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:28,176
You oughta be more open with
Pat. And me, for that matter.

606
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:32,764
Is there anything that happened
that day you haven't told us about?

607
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,810
I did not murder Betty Gore.

608
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:42,065
You and I are back-door friends.

609
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,320
I did not do it.

610
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,990
Everybody thinks I'm a monster.

611
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,993
My former pastor,
maybe my husband.

612
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,497
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, Don.

613
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,459
Candy, let's first
secure your freedom,

614
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,253
then we can worry about
what folks think of you.

615
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:07,381
I have to tell Pat. He
knows I'm not being honest.

616
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,801
For today, our
focus is Dr. Fason.

617
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,262
I don't know what's so
special about this Dr. Fason.

618
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,182
He can help us win at trial,

619
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,644
which makes him special to
me, and I would think to you.

620
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,646
What exactly do I tell him?

621
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,565
I told you. You
tell him everything.

622
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,276
Which includes the room.

623
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,987
You have to tell him everything
that happened in that room.

624
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:30,988
Hello.

625
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,532
Hi.

626
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,125
Did you see that?

627
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,087
I'm a sideshow!

628
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,009
It's not right!

629
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,552
It's not right that I'm
being kept in the dark!

630
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,972
She's gonna fall apart!

631
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,308
I can't help her if I
don't know what's going on!

632
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,768
It's lawyer-client
privilege, Pat.

633
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,771
I'm her goddamn husband!

634
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,193
I want you to pick a
point out on the wall.

635
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:10,946
Focus on it.

636
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:16,993
Now, take a deep breath.

637
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:19,997
Filling your chest. Good.

638
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:25,794
Slowly let the air out,
completely emptying your lungs.

639
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:27,963
Very good. Again.

640
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:30,382
Deep breath in.

641
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:37,306
Slowly let the air out,
completely emptying the lungs.

642
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,268
Everything here is safe.

643
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,105
Calm.

644
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:49,234
Peaceful.

645
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:57,033
As you relax, your eyes may
feel heavy and want to close.

646
00:42:57,034 --> 00:43:00,287
That's okay. Let
them drift and fall.

647
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,585
Listen to your body.

648
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:12,591
You are in complete
control of this time.

649
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,512
You really think this will help?

650
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,848
I have no idea.

651
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,809
It can't hurt.

652
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,522
We're going to go
back to June 13.

653
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,818
When you went into Betty
Gore's utility room.

654
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:36,447
When I snap my fingers, you
will begin re-experiencing

655
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,534
and relating that time
as you go through it.

656
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,411
One.

657
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,538
Two.

658
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,539
Three.

659
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,505
What's happening, Candy?

660
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,716
You can tell me.

661
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,468
When I reach the count of three,

662
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:01,138
your thoughts and your feelings
will get stronger and stronger.

663
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,558
Stronger and stronger

664
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,644
and stronger. So strong,

665
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:10,272
you will have to verbalize
them and express them.

666
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,775
One.

667
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:15,986
Two. So strong, you will
have to get them out.

668
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,864
Three. Let them out.

669
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,910
What's that you're
feeling, Candy?

670
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,208
Hate.

671
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,335
Okay.

672
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,547
You hate her.

673
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:37,800
Express your feelings.

674
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,512
Stronger and stronger.

675
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,223
I hate her.

676
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,475
Say it loud.

677
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,060
I hate her.

678
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,854
Louder.

679
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,065
I hate her!

680
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,776
She's ruined my whole life.

681
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:56,777
Look at this.

682
00:44:58,447 --> 00:44:59,656
I hate her!

683
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,535
I hate her!

684
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,537
When I count to three,

685
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:10,624
I want you to go back in time
to when she's shoving you.

686
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:16,046
You're in the utility room, and
she's shoving you. Just relax.

687
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,673
One.

688
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:18,924
Two.

689
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:19,926
Three.

690
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,306
What's happening now?

691
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:26,807
Go through it.

692
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,898
Feeling's very strong.

693
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,399
You hear that?

694
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,527
She sounds like
a wounded animal.

695
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,904
I don't want him.

696
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:42,573
- You can't have him!
- No.

697
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,201
The feelings are
getting stronger.

698
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,995
I don't want him!

699
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,247
Why are you doing this?

700
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:51,707
Betty!

701
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,752
What is she doing
now? Tell me, Candy.

702
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:55,879
You.

703
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,798
Stop! You stop!

704
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:03,011
Stop! Stop it! Stop!

705
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:06,097
Stop!

706
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,100
- What the hell?
- Should we go in there?

707
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,233
Oh, no.

708
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:21,404
It's okay.

709
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,783
It's over now.

710
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,743
You're okay.

711
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,663
You can't do that.

712
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:34,459
Candy, do you ever recall
being this mad before?

713
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,215
Maybe when you were little?

714
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,842
Let's go back in time.

715
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,803
One. Back in time. Two.

716
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,264
Three.

717
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,809
- How old are you, Candy?
- Four.

718
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,436
Four years old.

719
00:46:54,104 --> 00:46:55,146
Why are you so mad?

720
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:58,942
Why so mad?

721
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,575
What will they think of
you in the waiting room?

722
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:08,827
Stop crying. Shh!

723
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:16,125
And how does it feel
when she says "shh"?

724
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:18,544
I wanna scream.

725
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,045
Candy, on the count of three,

726
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,298
- you're gonna scream all you want. One.
- I can't.

727
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:23,591
You can. Two.

728
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:24,968
Three.

729
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:36,730
Is this real?

730
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,358
Could she be faking?

731
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,571
Candy, on three, you
will feel no pain.

732
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,698
You are incapable of
feeling any pain whatsoever.

733
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,951
One, two, three.

734
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:26,236
On three, you will
feel very, very cold.

735
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,989
Very cold. One. Two.

736
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,492
Three.

737
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,041
Look there.

738
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:43,672
You ever know anyone
to fake a goosebump?

739
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,398
Well, what did he say?

740
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,318
That

741
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,656
you snapped.

742
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,034
That you're not a sociopath.

743
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:18,498
You, you just snapped.

744
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,263
So, what exactly
did you talk about?

745
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,309
Just all kinds of this and that.

746
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,228
Honestly, I'm not really
sure of the point.

747
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:44,774
I'm just glad to be back.

748
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,902
Can you eat your Brussels
sprouts, young man?

749
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,030
You, too, missy.

750
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,121
Can Alisa still
come for sleepovers?

751
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:04,627
Of course, she can, sweetie. She's
still your best friend, right?

752
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:09,716
It would be nice to have Alisa
over. I bet she misses you.

753
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,430
I'll get it.

754
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,058
Hello?

755
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,645
Pat, it's Don Crowder.

756
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:26,024
<i>Don't say anything. Just
listen for a bit, okay?</i>

757
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:31,488
Candy says you wanna know
the truth about everything.

758
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,365
<i>I'm thinking that's a good idea.</i>

759
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,286
So I'm gonna tell
you what happened.

760
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:42,915
<i>- Is that okay, Pat?</i>
- Yes. Yeah, that's fine.

761
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,959
I'm gonna tell you exactly.

762
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,545
Mom?

763
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,050
- What's gonna happen?
- Well

764
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:55,678
there will just
be a little trial.

765
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,766
And they will present
evidence and so forth.

766
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,646
And then, the jury
will find that

767
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,148
I'm innocent.

768
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,529
And we can all go back
to being a normal family.

769
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,827
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Yes.
