00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,060
- Like, way past starving.

183
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,585
- I didn't make anything
all day. I was just--

184
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,543
- Pizza night.

185
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:24,025

- No, no.

188

the job, right?

- What?

193
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,835
- This dude and your girl,
you saw them boning?

194
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,445
- No, I didn't see them--

195
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,839
- I'd go mental seeming him all
freaky all over her.

- I feel for you, bro.
- Thank you.

- Your girl say anything about
how he stacked up?

00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:03,673
You know, down there?

200
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,501
- No, she didn't share details.

201
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,850
- I bet homeboy had
some package.

202
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,591
- Big fat pumpkin, right?

about a banger.

- It's gonna cost extra.
