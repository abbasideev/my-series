350
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,769
- Take the keys, Beth.

351
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,687
- Next time, I hold the gun.

352
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:07,564
.

353
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,697
- Hey, where--where
is the beer?

354
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,264
- In the cooler
in the basement.

355
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:14,267
- Well, that'll only take
me an hour.

356
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,182
- Where can I sell a car
for parts?

357
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:21,535
- We're not selling our car.
- It's not our car.

358
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,276
- Whose is it?
- It doesn't matter.

359
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,799
- Well, I'd like to know.
- I don't know.

360
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,279
- What is this, "Fast and the
Furious?" It is, isn't it?

361
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:27,802
- I don't have a lot of time.

362
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,456
- What does he think he's
Vin Diesel all of a sudden?

363
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,631
I'm not an idiot.
- You're just going to have

364
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,285
to trust me, okay?

365
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,287
- Trust you? I have a bullet
lodged a half inch

366
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,897
from my spine because you
can't stop seeing this guy.

367
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,638
Oh,
but I'm supposed to trust you.

368
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,727
I'm supposed to trust that you
have a great idea what to do

369
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,337

- Let me help you.

370
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,905
- I got it, thank you!
I said I've got it!

371
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,273
You should talk to Dominic
in Service.

He's been around.

373
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,625
- Okay.

374
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,326
- What kind of car is it?

375
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,198
- A Tesla.

376
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,505
- You can't sell
a Tesla for parts.

377
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,636
- Why not?

378
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,899
It's like a giant iPad.

379
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,861

he wants a baby.

- What?

397
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,277

when you were pregnant?

- What if there
is something really wrong?

407
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,967

I think you should just...

408
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,708
Just talk to him.

409
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,972

you know, it's just nerves.

It's probably that.

Are you ever going to look at
him the same way you used to?

he did it for Dean.

- What's that?
- Oh. It's a phone, Nana.

you can't call long distance.

out of town.

and this way you can.

uh, here, check this out.

each other any time we want.

- But you're right around
the corner.

508
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,783
- Yeah, but what if I wasn't.
- But you are.

509
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:08,958

- Are you in any
sort of trouble?

513
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,758
- No.

514
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:34,505
- Mildred's grandkids
got her one of these.

515
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,857
- I think it was so
they didn't have to visit.

516
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,902
- Oh, yeah?
Did she use it?

517
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,904
- For about a week.

518
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,776
Then she died.
