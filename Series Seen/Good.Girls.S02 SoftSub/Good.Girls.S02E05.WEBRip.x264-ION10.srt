00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,043
- A mashi?
What the hell is that?

184
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,219
- No, um, no,
you know, like a, um,

185
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:34,225
like a giant--
like a giant K-N-I-F-E.

186
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,837
An A-X-E?

187
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,014
- No, I know
how to spell A-X-E.

188
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:43,147
Like a big--like a big,
you know, like a big, um...

189
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,802
S-W-O-R-D.
Like... [vocalizes]

190
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,848
- A cleaver?
- No. No.

191
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:53,897
- Oh, um, you know, they had
them in R-A-W-A-N-D-A.

192
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,943
You know? Oh, with that
terrible uprising.

193
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,510
- Rwanda?
- Yes, but can you--

194
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,511
- Machete!
- Shh!

195
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,817
- [whispers]
Machete?

196
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,210
- Yes.
- Jesus.

197
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,820
- Yes. I know.

[upbeat children's music

199
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,564
Can you just, like,
go arrest them now or--

200
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,523
- Mm-mm, I need to find
the B-O-D-Y first.

201
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,264
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,572
How's that going?

203
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,356
- We're getting there.

204
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,708
- Yeah, that's good.

205
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:28,628
- We need you to make it...
go away.

206
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:32,544
- Without, you know,
making her go away.

207
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,590
- Unless push comes to shove.

208
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,026
[indistinct chatter]

209
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,376
Yes, I know. She's a mother.

210
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,943
Yes, I know she has four kids.

211
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,684
But we have, like, seven
between us.

212
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,555
- What did I say about
your rotten egg?

213
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,470
- So what do you want, a medal?

214
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,689
- Yeah, maybe I do.

215
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,170
- Can you somehow shut it down?

216
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,650
- I can try.

217
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,782
- Just to be crystal clear,
we need

218
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,871
the situation that we're in
to go away,

219
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:59,180
not the rotten egg
who caused the situation.

220
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,313
- Yeah, I'm gonna need
200 G's. Fresh.

221
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,794
- What?

222
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,317
- Shutting things down
ain't cheap.

223
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,885
- On top of what we're
already washing for you?

224
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,235
- Jesus.
How much to just smoke her?

225
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,716
- We don't have time
to sell that many cars.

226
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,762
- It is what it is.

227
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,462
You need time to think it over?

228
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,811
Maybe a quick bathroom break?

[rock music playing

230
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,336
No?

231
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,816
- No.

232
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,384
We're good.

233
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,391
- Really? Are we?

234
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:48,316
.

235
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,926
- [chuckling]

236
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,494
Hey. Have you seen
this Fluff Challenge?

237
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,409
The dog thinks the owner
actually disappears.

238
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,063
It's hilarious.

239
00:11:56,106 --> 00:12:00,632
- How many cars would we
have to sell to make 200 grand?

240
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,243
Ball park?

241
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,289
- Uh...
[chuckles]

242
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,900
Like, you know, 20 or 30.

243
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,858
It just kind of depends
on the model.

244
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,381
- How about the Vettes?

245
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,601
- Ooh, that takes
the right kind of customer.

246
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:14,516
- Well, it needs
to happen quick.

247
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,562
- Well that's--that's not
really how it works.

248
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,739
Plus we don't have that kind
of inventory right now.

249
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,959
- How do we get
that kind of inventory?

250
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,569
- Oh, man.

251
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,748
That guy.
What a--what a punk.

252
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,880
I mean, he's already got
60% of the business.

253
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,229
- It's not for him.

254
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,796
- I am not gonna be
his little bitch.

255
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,884
If he wanted an ATM,

256
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,407
he should have knocked over
a 7/11.

257
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm trying to run
a business here.

258
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,236
- It's for me.

259
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,716
I need it.

260
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,197
- Why?

261
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,939
- Can you get the cars?

262
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,592
- Yes.

263
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:50,465
- Thank you.
- Maybe.

264
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,773
- Is there a problem?

265
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,775
- No, there's no problem,
per se.

266
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:59,256
It's just--it's just more of,
uh, you know...

267
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,781

with prices starting
at just $800.

Can you feel the deals?

[cheesy new wave music]

00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,765
- I mean...

277
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,940
- I know.

278
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,028
- Wow.

279
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,116
- I know.

280
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,292
- I thought she moved to LA.

281
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,859
- I bought her the ticket.

282
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,643
- Looks like she did
for a hot minute.

283
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,559
- Let's see,
she was Dead Girl on Pier

284
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,300
on "NCIS Los Angeles."

285
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:46,347
- I'm sorry, is she acting like
she works at the car auction

286
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,305
or does she
actually work there?

287
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,177
- Oh, she's like
the gatekeeper.

288
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,701
And she's got Dean
on permanent waiting list.

289
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,398
- She's blackballing him?

290
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,661
- Yeah, I mean,
can you blame her?

291
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:59,099
- Ooh,
also Mutilated Corpse in Woods

292
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:00,883
on "Criminal Minds."

293
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,537
And...

294
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,845
Well, that's it.

295
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,934
- So, we go down there,
we kiss her bony ass

296
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,110
and tell her the cars
are for us and not Dean.

297
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,243
- And by "we," we mean not you.

298
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,289
- Yeah, you don't go anywhere
near her bony ass.

299
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,160
- No, no.
We will take care of it.

300
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,597
- You guys, I'm fine.

301
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,338
It was a long time ago.

302
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,645
People make mistakes.

303
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:27,083
- I told myself, "Amber,
you give it six months,"

304
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:30,043
and if acting is not
in the cards, then go home.

305
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:34,177
I really wanted to be realistic
about my prospects, you know?

306
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:37,224
I'm not saying I needed
to be Anne Hathaway famous,

307
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:40,270
but I definitely
should have been

308
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,839
John Krasinski's wife level.

309
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,146
- Emily Blunt?

310
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,756
- I don't know what that means.

311
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,195
- What about the 5 grand
I gave you?

312
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,981
- Acting classes
are so expensive.

313
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,373
- Got any left?

314
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,592
- Sorry.

315
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,768
- I bet it goes fast out there.

316
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,771
And I didn't want to take
a day job, you know?

317
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:05,556
Like, I moved out there to act.

318
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,603
Not wait tables, so...

319
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:17,351
Mrs. Boland... I seriously
can't believe you're here.

320
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:20,136
- I'm here.

321
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,443
- I really owe you one.

322
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,749
- How about 20?

323
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,577
As in motor vehicles.

324
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:29,276
- Yeah.
- What do you say?

325
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,756
- For him, right?
- For me.

326
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,716
- And we can pay cash.

327
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,198
Look at that.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:41,418
- Cash... money.

329
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:44,117
- I don't care about the money.

330
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,683
- Look.

331
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,730
What he did to both of us
is completely terrible

332
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,602
and I can't excuse what he did.

333
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,169
- Did you forgive him?

334
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,697
- You know what?

335
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,831
I think I did.

336
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,574
- Well.

337
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,706
You're a better person than me.

338
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,275
I don't know, I just--

339
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,713
I don't think I could just
forget all those times...

340
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:22,068
- And when you say
all those times, Amber...

341
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,026
- Nuh-uh.

342
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,944
- Do you mean all those times
with one woman or...

343
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:35,037
One time with all those women?

344
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:41,087
- Or... all those times
with all those women.

345
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,393
- [whispering]
There's no good answer here.

346
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,482
- [scoffs]

347
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,049
I'm so confused.

348
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:52,315
- How many women did my husband
cheat on me with?

349
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,838
- Um...

350
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,843
Lifetime or per year?

351
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,715
- It's not the damn census.

352
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:03,022
- Oy vey.

353
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,985
[pounding]

354
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,173
- Well, the good news is,
we got the cars.

355
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,306
- Yay.

356
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,179
- I mean, if you--

357
