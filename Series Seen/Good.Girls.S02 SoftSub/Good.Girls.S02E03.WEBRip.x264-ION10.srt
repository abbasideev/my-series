the deposition again.

719
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:54,288
- See, you worry too much.

720
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:56,508
- Anything I need to know?

721
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,641
- Nope.
- Client-attorney privilege.

722
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:03,166
- All good.
- Are you being careful?

723
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,603
- Always.

724
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,350
- Did you go for a run?

725
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,177
- If by "run" you mean

726
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,571
a sad old man shuffle,
then yes.

727
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,312
- Good for you.

728
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,227
- Yeah, PT's starting
to pay off.

729
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,142
- I found a therapist.

730
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,492
- I thought you said
we couldn't afford one.

731
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:26,494
- He's a grad student
at Wayne State.

732
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,104
They need the hours,
so he's cheap.

733
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:30,106
- Nice, how soon can he start?

734
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,760
- I think this week.

735
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,675
- I just want Kenny
to feel safe again, you know?

736
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,242
- Me too.

737
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:38,680
- Hey what do you
think about Krav Maga?

738
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,205
- Huh?

739
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,251
- It's this badass Israeli
like, fighting style.

740
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:46,688
My PT guy says it'll make him
feel more in control.

741
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,258
- Yeah, sure.

742
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,433
- Cool.

743
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:56,394
You okay?

744
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,048
- Yeah, I've just had--had
too much coffee.

745
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:01,355
- Slow down, tiger.

746
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,270
I am going to go do abs.
