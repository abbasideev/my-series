1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,920
I need what I asked for... today.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,920
Or we'll pop round, pay Jenny a visit.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,896
Whatever he was doing,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
he didn't want anyone else to know
he was doing it. Tell me that's not dirty.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,440
He's making a decision on the roll
of a dice. Who to kill, when to kill...

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,680
whether or not to kill.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,280
Jenny.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,120
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm really, really sorry.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,640
- Justin, I can't talk tonight.
- We've got another one.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,040
It's started again.
There's two of them.

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,280
Somebody stop him!

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,480
Somebody stop that man!

14
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,480
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

15
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,200
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

16
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,320
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,280
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you. ♪

18
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,720
I've got to go to work.

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
- Oh.
- Yes, I have to.

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Cos if I don't show up,
they're gonna wonder why.

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Can't afford that.

22
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,320
The police are not our biggest worry
right now.

23
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,600
Toby's grandmother is.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,640
We have to move his car.

25
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,240
Hey.

26
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
Oi.

27
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,920
I know what you're going through.

28
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't think you do.

29
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,360
- I just...
- Only two things matter right now.

30
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,240
And one... is, this was self-defence.

31
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,240
And two...

32
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,160
I'lL never let anyone hurt you.

33
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,240
Ever.

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
Now, Toby's car is still downstairs.

35
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't think I can do that.

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,920
Jenny, listen to me. When we're scared,
we don't think straight.

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,160
Are you scared?

38
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,720
Yeah.

39
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,800
But if we act like scared people,
we're gonna get caught.

40
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
We don't want that, do we?

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
No.

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,080
So I'm gonna need you to help me carve
some time to think this thing through.

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,560
Yeah?

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
What about him?

45
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,760
All right.

46
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,320
Listen to me. Jenny, while I'm gone,
you've got to clean this place.

47
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,720
Use the stuff in this bucket.

48
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
OK? Get rid of the bucket.

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,640
And I'll be back as soon as I can, OK?

50
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,416
- I know what I saw.
- I'm not saying you don't.

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,760
- So what was Luther doing?
- I don't know.

52
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,640
- But you asked him?
- I did, yeah.

53
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,056
Well, what did he say?
"Not to worry, just a misunderstanding"?

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,336
At which point, you rolled over
and let him tickle your tummy.

55
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,440
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

56
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,920
You've gotta help me, Justin. I'm twisting
in the wind here. I don't know what to do.

57
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,240
I don't know which way to turn. I'm asking
for help and you're giving me nothing.

58
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,440
How bad?

59
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,840
Three dead, four injured.

60
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,680
Stab wounds and chemical burns.

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,000
This is the last known victim,
Richard Gardiner.

62
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,480
Younger brother, brother's fiancée
among the injured.

63
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
- Killer?
- No sign.

64
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,680
SOCO found this a few hundred yards
down that way.

65
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
The killer dropped his wallet
in the chase.

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
No ID, just cash and a keycard.

67
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,400
Do we know to what hotel?

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,136
No. There's a lot of myths
about those things.

69
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,016
All they contain is
a check-in and check-out date.

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,680
There's no way to identify
the hotel it came from.

71
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,520
So what do you think's going on?
Do you think we've got a copycat?

72
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,320
No, I think we've got two killers
in competition.

73
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,800
If we can find out the rules
to the competition, then we can stop 'em.

74
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,560
Find out what door that opens.

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,760
- Sir, show me the other side, please.
- There's an advert on there.

76
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,400
Got anything I can clean that up with?

77
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,480
I'll see if Benny
can do something with it.

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,720
- Brothers?
- No. More than that.

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,360
They're twins.

80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Twins with a shared psychosis.

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,800
Turning one will not be easy.

82
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,040
It might not even be possible
without a map into their heads.

83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,280
We don't even know what their names are.

84
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,416
- I think you're right.
- About what?

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,640
It's a scoring system.

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,000
You score a certain amount of points
for who you kill,

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,360
and then you get bonuses for
where you kill 'em and how you kill ‘em.

88
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
So it's a sort of a tally
of experience points.

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,080
- Experience points?
- Yeah, a way

90
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,760
to measure your progress
through a game.

91
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,360
So... these men are...

92
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,160
killing with hammers, knives, acid,

93
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,880
because they have yet to score enough
points to graduate to better weapons?

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,600
- That's definitely a possibility, yeah.
- And when this man

95
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,120
has bludgeoned and stabbed
enough people to death,

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,080
then he qualifies to kill even more people
with, what - guns, bombs?

97
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,400
We'll catch him
before it gets to that point.

98
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,640
- Ideas as to how?
- We've got this.

99
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,120
- We think it's an encrypted password.
- To what?

100
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,720
- If we can decode it, we can tell you.
- What do you need?

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,040
Well, it's a non-repeating,
randomised sequence.

102
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,840
- Like a book code?
- Exactly like an old book code.

103
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
To break the code...

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,256
We need to know the book
he's used to make the encryption.

105
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,456
But not just the right title,
we need the exact edition.

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,200
So it's the password,
is the way into this.

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,680
- What have you got?
- Er, the advert's

108
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
for the Frangipani restaurant.

109
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,176
I'm checking with the owners
to see if they can remember

110
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,816
which hotel advertised them
on their keycards.

111
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,416
Find it, call me and I'll meet you there.

112
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,320
- Will do.
- I won't be long.

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Er, Mr Kasemsarn?

114
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,720
This is DS Gray from
the Serious and Serial Crimes Unit.

115
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm enquiring about an advert
you put out on a hotel keycard.

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,736
You know what you're doing
and where you're going?

117
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,800
I think so.

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,880
What if I get stopped?
Does this look like it's my car?

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,720
Don't get stopped, all right?

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,680
Buy some SIM cards.

121
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,080
Don't use one SIM card more than once.

122
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,840
If you do get stopped,
don't say a word, not even your name.

123
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,240
Tell the duty solicitor to call me
and I'll come get you.

124
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,960
Okey-dokey.

125
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
Oi! Don't get stopped.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
All right, go on, then.

127
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,360
Easy on the accelerator.

128
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,560
All right, go on. Put your seatbelt on!

129
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,040
Not very good, are you, Frank?

130
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,520
No, but apparently it's what you do
when you get to my age.

131
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,280
So what happened to your pet polecat?

132
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
How do you mean?

133
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Where's Toby?

134
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,080
He didn't show?

135
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,680
What can I say?
The kid's an embarrassment.

136
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,400
Do me a favour, Frank.
You tell him

137
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,360
I need more time,
more consultation

138
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
and way better manners.

139
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,080
Sir.

140
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,960
Right, good news is, we found this laptop.

141
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
Oh, yeah? So what's the bad news?

142
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,280
We need to find a particular book

143
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,840
- to break the password, yeah?
- Yeah.

144
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,880
- Yeah, well, wait till you see this.

145
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
It'll take weeks.

146
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,800
But it's not right, though, is it?

147
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,760
Not right, how?

148
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,360
Well, I mean, in order for a book code
to work, you need the exact edition.

149
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,040
That way, if you lose your book...

150
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,896
You can get another copy
of the exact same edition.

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,720
Right, but all this, this lot here,
this is all

152
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,880
second-hand junk shop copies, innit?
I mean, how are you gonna get

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,480
an exact copy of that?

154
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,400
Eh? Or... or that?

155
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,360
No.

156
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,680
I need to see another room.

157
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
Gideon's Bible.

158
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,760
There's one of these in every hotel room
in the country.

159
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,120
The key to breaking that code
is in this book.

160
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
Get that and that laptop back to Benny.

161
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,960
Are you...
You know, are things all right?

162
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,960
You solve your problem?

163
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm on top of it.

164
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,480
I'll meet you back at the shop.

165
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,120
Toby's missing.

166
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
What do you mean, he's missing?

167
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,840
Nobody's seen him since yesterday.

168
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,440
That's not missing. That's... late.

169
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
Not for Toby.

170
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
He's had an argument with Frank,

171
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,920
so he's probably embarrassed,
had a drink

172
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
and decided
to screw himself into a coma.

173
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,160
What kind of argument with Frank?

174
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,840
You can't blame Frank.
I mean, he was doing a decent job.

175
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Toby... Toby is out of control.

176
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Best I can do
is keep my ear to the ground

177
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,736
and if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

178
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,040
- Yeah, you do that.
- All right.

179
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,120
John?

180
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,920
Listen, I need you
to get out of the flat now.

181
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,560
- But I haven't finished.
- Finish and get out.

182
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,040
- Do they know?
- They know something's not right.

183
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
- What if they find him?
- They won't find him.

184
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,440
- But what if they do?
- I need you to get out of the flat,

185
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,680
keep your head down for a while, OK?

186
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,704
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

187
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,320
Sorry, Toby.

188
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
Wotcha!

189
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,000
Frank, what are you doing here?

190
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,160
Waiting for you.
What are you doing here?

191
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,160
What's in the boot, John?

192
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
None of your business
what's in my boot.

193
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Open it.

194
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,160
So what are you saying,
I open the boot or you shoot me?

195
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,920
- Don't make me answer that.
- Frank, you really wanna do this?

196
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
All right.

197
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,800
All right. You win.

198
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,160
Step back.

199
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,320
- What's in that bag?
- It's my work gear, all right?!

200
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,520
My stabby, my body armour.

201
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,600
- Zip it open.
- Come on, Frank!

202
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,040
Just do it!

203
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,880
What a performance.

204
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,800
You happy now, Frank?

205
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,040
Listen, I'm gonna go now.

206
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,200
Before you embarrass yourself
with another senior moment,

207
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
why don't you do yourself a favour?

208
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,000
Find your boy, slap him,
take him back to his nan.

209
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,920
And while you're at it,
you give him a slap from me.

210
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm about done with all this.

211
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,880
Shit!

212
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
What do you want?

213
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,560
70 help you out.

214
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,440
I've heard that one before.

215
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm still laughing.

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
Listen, you've got bigger things
to worry about.

217
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,480
What do you mean?
I don't know what you mean.

218
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,360
It means, I want five minutes alone
with Jenny, ask her some questions.

219
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,680
She's not in trouble -
I just need a chat, that's all.

220
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,000
You help me get that and I'm out of
your hair for good. So's John Luther.

221
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,400
Right.

222
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,320
And how do you intend
to make that happen?

223
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,880
- How do you think?
- Oh.

224
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
Look...

225
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,920
she's not here.

226
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,320
I don't know where she is.

227
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,520
How did I do?

228
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,920
Did I do OK?

229
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,400
You did great.

230
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Did great.

231
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,120
Well done.

232
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,400
All right?

233
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,160
But this isn't over.

234
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,520
Not yet.

235
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,440
I need you to find a place to hide.

236
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,240
Think you can do that?

237
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Think I might want my mum.

238
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,360
Jenny, I don't think
you should go back there.

239
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
But if it makes you feel better...

240
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,880
You're so nice.

241
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,640
Why aren't you married?

242
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
You should be, though.

243
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,600
You should be married.

244
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,840
All happy and everything.

245
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
No-one'll have me.

246
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Go on.

247
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,400
Let's go.

248
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,440
- When did it happen?
- Six minutes.

249
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,416
- Uniform got there two minutes ago.
- And the killer?

250
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,576
He ran onto Lyntall Street, but he could
be north, south, anywhere, really.

251
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,080
- How we doing with the rest of it?
- Warm off the press.

252
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,680
All right, cool.

253
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,160
Excellent.

254
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,480
- Get that other stuff and get in here.
- OK.

255
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,520
Your password was pretty secure.

256
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,920
Cracked it.

257
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,200
Liverpool Street, this happened.

258
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,976
See, what he's done,
to compensate for a low-scoring weapon,

259
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,080
- he's used a high-scoring strategy.
- Mm.

260
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,800
Then this. People carrier. Broad daylight.

261
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Males, right -
that's good, isn't it, males?

262
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,600
Um... loads of witnesses.

263
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,280
- Again, another high-scoring tactic.
- His name's Nicholas.

264
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,880
Your name's Robert.

265
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,080
The Japanese have got a great word
for it, "hikikomori".

266
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,680
It means people
that withdraw from the world.

267
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,560
That's what you and your brother
have been doing, right?

268
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
Now look at you.

269
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,400
Banged up, in here. Game over.

270
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
- While Nick...
- Nicholas.

271
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,840
Nicholas...

272
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,640
is out there,

273
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,720
making up for all the times
he was the quiet one.

274
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,360
- He's scoring very high for audacity.
- So?

275
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,256
- So what do you think about that?
- What do you think?

276
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,880
Oh, I'll tell you what I think.
I'm glad you asked that.

277
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,200
I think that you and Nicholas
are very, very close.

278
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,160
Outstandingly so, even for twins.

279
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,480
You want to know what else I think?

280
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,720
I think there's a limit
to that closeness.

281
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,120
A limit.

282
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,640
I mean, after all, you are one of two.

283
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,200
Eh, Robert?

284
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
You are a man in your own right.

285
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,080
- Do you know what else you are?
- What else am I?

286
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,920
- You're winning.
- I don't care about winning.

287
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,600
You and your brother

288
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,000
get them strangers all right.

289
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,320
But when it's down
to the last men standing,

290
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,480
it's you against him, isn't it, Robert?

291
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,120
And I think you do actually care who wins,

292
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,400
because you really, really want it
to be you.

293
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,280
What are you asking me?

294
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm saying that the way Nicholas
is racking up a great score,

295
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,680
you won't be winning
for much longer, will you?

296
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,840
- So?
- So why don't you help me catch him?

297
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Before he beats you.

298
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,760
I'll play you for it.

299
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,840
I can't do that.

300
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,400
Then it isn't going to happen.

301
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,960
What are the rules of the game?

302
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,560
It's a dilemma throw.

303
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,040
That makes it a straight 50/50,
meaning I roll 1 to 10,

304
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,760
I help you catch my brother.

305
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,320
Iroll 11 to 20, you're on your own.

306
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,000
Go on, then.

307
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,880
- If you do catch him...
- Yeah?

308
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,360
Tell him I love him.

309
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,760
Sorry.

310
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,440
Don't be.

311
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,840
This is your home.

312
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
You're welcome here any time.

313
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
Do you want to tell me what's wrong?

314
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,840
Are you on drugs?

315
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,320
Is it drugs again?

316
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,680
Did he hurt you?

317
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,320
Did that man hurt you?

318
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
No!

319
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
Then what is it, love?

320
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,440
I really want to tell you, but I can't.

321
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,160
Why not?

322
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,240
I just can't.

323
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,280
So, if Nicholas Millberry believed
that his brother had escaped...

324
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,680
This is how he would communicate -
via the blog.

325
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,160
Run it past me -
exactly how do they communicate?

326
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,600
Robert and Nicholas
set up an everyday blog -

327
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,440
by design,
the most boring blog in the world.

328
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,920
All but guaranteed to attract no traffic.

329
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,640
But if it does attract a passer-by...

330
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,200
Well, they password-protected it.

331
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,696
- But you cracked it.
- Benny cracked it.

332
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,560
- By breaking the book code?
- Yeah.

333
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,240
Yeah. Once you're in,
the blog just consists of boring posts.

334
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,280
So what, these posts are coded?

335
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,960
Well, no, they speak via the comments.

336
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
Nicholas'll have an RSS feed
on his phone.

337
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,600
So as soon as a new comment's
posted, he'll receive an alert.

338
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,920
Which means we can control
and trace the communications.

339
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,440
Have you got any better ideas?

340
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,280
- Who was that?
- God. Sorry, did I wake you?

341
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,880
No.

342
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,520
So who was it?

343
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,960
- Esther.
- Who?

344
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,040
Esther.

345
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,120
Used to live down the road from us,
on Cavalry Close.

346
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,800
The ginge?

347
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
No. Esther.

348
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,520
The one with all the boobs?

349
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,160
That's her.

350
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,560
I was supposed to go over and see her.

351
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,400
But I cancelled for my girl.

352
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,000
Thanks, Mum.

353
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,360
John. I think my mum
may have done something stupid.

354
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,200
Give me two minutes and I'll call you
back as soon as I leave this building.

355
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,320
Where's he going?

356
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,240
He's working the case.

357
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,960
Yeah, in mysterious ways,
his wonders to perform.

358
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,120
Why don't you just cut him some slack?

359
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,360
And this feels right to you, does it?

360
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,880
Deliberately feeding lies to the media.

361
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
Because, correct me if I'm wrong,

362
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,560
but it looks like that's what he's doing.

363
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,536
The media don't care if it's lies,
as long as there's a good story in it.

364
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,400
Well, that's not the point, is it?

365
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,360
Can you think of a better way
to get Nicholas Millberry off the streets?

366
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,280
Touch a hair on her head
and I'll rip your balls out.

367
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,960
Don't worry -
you're doing the right thing.

368
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,560
Where is she?

369
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,400
Jen?

370
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,160
Jen!

371
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,880
Genevieve...
can you come out a minute, please?

372
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,240
- Jen?
- Where is she?

373
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,320
I don't know...

374
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,560
I don't know.

375
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,480
What is going on here? If there is
some kind of setup going on here,

376
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,816
you are gonna be the first to suffer,
let me tell you now. Get her for me!

377
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,720
- Get her for me! Where is she?
- I don't know!

378
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,160
- Call her!
- I've been trying. I don't where she is!

379
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,600
- Call her again!
- He's in there. Do I do it now?

380
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,680
Yes. Do it now. Call the police.

381
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
- Don't worry about your mum.
- Promise?

382
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,360
If you want to help your mum,
you need to keep it together

383
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,120
and do as we agreed.

384
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,880
And don't go back in there,

385
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,320
cos Frank might not hurt your mum,
but he will hurt you.

386
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
- All right?
- OK.

387
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,840
I've got to go. Keep it together, do it.

388
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,000
You all right?

389
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,600
It has to come
from an anonymous police source.

390
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,480
Police, please.
I-T just seen a car pull up to this house.

391
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,000
It's a silver... how do you say it?
Hyund...

392
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,680
Hyundai, yeah.

393
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,360
This bloke got out
and he was holding this gun or something.

394
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,240
No, yeah, it was definitely a gun.

395
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Well, there's this other thing.
I know this might sound a bit mental...

396
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,120
Shut up! All right, listen.

397
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,200
Call your daughter.

398
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,880
Tell her to be back here
in ten minutes

399
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,160
or I am gonna go to work on you.
Have you got that?

400
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,800
Who called the police?
Is there another way out?

401
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,600
Yeah. Up... out there. Up...

402
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,640
- Guy, got a body.
- John, you clever bastard.

403
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,760
- Are we prepped?
- Yeah.

404
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,520
OK, so I've prepared some entries, based
on some of Robert's previous postings.

405
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,520
OK. What does that say?

406
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,360
- Um, hello, basically.
- Hello. Nothing wrong with saying hello.

407
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,560
Were you never young?

408
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,120
- DS Gray... if you wouldn't mind?
- Yes, ma'am.

409
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,200
DS Gray, you apprised me that DCI Luther
used the fire alarm the other day

410
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,560
as a pretext to gain access

411
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
to Detective Superintendent Schenk's
personal computer.

412
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,880
Yes, ma'am, I did.

413
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,760
I had IT run a report
on Schenk's computer.

414
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,640
It shows no activity
during the fire alarm.

415
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,720
What angle are you trying to work, Erin?

416
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,680
Is there a plan? I hope you've got a plan,

417
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,080
- this isn't just random game playing.
- Ma'am, I'm confused. I don't...

418
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
If you're so keen
to smear a superior officer,

419
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,280
you're gonna have to be smarter than that,
a lot smarter.

420
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
Now get out of my sight.

421
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
Go for a walk.

422
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,280
Do some serious thinking
about your future in this department...

423
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,720
and this service.

424
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,280
Sorry.

425
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,840
Once we've posted a comment,

426
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,920
his alert comes in on an RSS feed
on his laptop or his mobile.

427
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
As soon as he responds,
I can trace his connection.

428
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,680
- How did you do it?
- How did I do what?

429
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,240
- Guv, come on.
- No, DS Gray, you come on.

430
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,440
Was it you? Did you do it for him?

431
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,040
Um...

432
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,280
Sorry... what he says, Erin.
You lost me at hello.

433
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,640
Erin, what is going on?

434
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,560
The creatures outside looked
from pig to man, and from man to pig,

435
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,080
and still it was impossible to tell...

436
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,640
which was which.

437
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
What was that about?

438
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
I'm not sure.

439
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,360
I do know that Carroway had IT

440
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,920
crawling all over Schenk's
computer archives earlier.

441
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

442
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,600
What do you think he's been up to?

443
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,160
I don't know.
I expect we'll find out soon enough.

444
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,840
Right...

445
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,640
let's get started.

446
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,640
Type in "hello".

447
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,880
Robert Millberry was arrested
and taken into custody

448
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
in connection with two brutal attacks
in London two days ago.

449
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,560
Police have refused to comment
on reports that Robert Millberry

450
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,840
escaped from custody today
and is currently at large in the capital.

451
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
The story has appeared
in several internet news sites

452
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,520
but no official report has yet been
published by the Metropolitan Police.

453
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,680
Millberry allegedly escaped
from a prisoner transfer van

454
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,440
after overpowering a guard.

455
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,600
Fears are growing that
there's a link between Robert Millberry

456
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,920
and the violent massacre that took place
on a London Underground station

457
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,680
the night of his arrest.

458
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,680
I did it.

459
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
You did what, Justin?

460
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,760
Hacked into the database, cleared
all the history on Schenk's computer.

461
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,680
So when Carroway went digging,
there was nothing to find.

462
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,640
Oh...

463
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,440
She was only trying
to do the right thing.

464
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,920
She doesn't deserve
to be punished for it - it's wrong.

465
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,720
- Yeah, it is wrong.
- I need to make it right.

466
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,040
Justin, I will.

467
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
Not you, me - I did it,
so I need to make it right.

468
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,000
Right, he's answering. He's live.

469
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,760
All right, Benny, what we got?

470
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,840
Just give me a moment. He's connected
to the blog. I'm tracing his ISP.

471
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440
Got him.

472
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,120
He's at the Enspire Coffee Bar,
Endymion Way.

473
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,080
John, we're closer than you.
I'll see you there.

474
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,480
All right.

475
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,040
Gotcha.

476
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,736
- All right, what's he saying?
- He's joking,

477
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,600
saying Robert should have stuck
to the no-capture zone.

478
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,480
Benny's asking him what his next move is.
He's typed "SEAL".

479
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,560
- Slaying Everyone And Laughing.
- Stay with him, Benny.

480
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,000
What's he saying now?

481
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,720
Benny's asking him
to be more specific.

482
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,200
OK. "Grinding MOBS".
So he's talking about massacre.

483
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,200
Something's wrong.
He's stopped responding.

484
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,720
Benny, we're almost there.

485
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,840
I don't think he's talking
about knives and hammers, guv.

486
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,640
He's talking about carnage.

487
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,120
We've got to stand these men down.

488
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,400
It's too late.

489
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,880
Nicholas Millberry, do not move!

490
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,120
Police marksmen have you in their sights.

491
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,480
Please stand, placing your hands
slowly on your head.

492
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,840
He's got something under his coat.

493
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,320
It's not right, is it?

494
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,480
- All right, stand down, hold your fire.
- Hold fire!

495
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,160
Right, that's a dead man's switch.

496
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,200
We take a shot,
his hand loosens on the trigger.

497
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,240
Vest detonates.

498
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,160
How big of a blast are we looking at?

499
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,080
Given the bulk of that vest, we're
looking at a hundred-foot kill radius.

500
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,480
Boss, setting up.

501
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,520
Assuming he maintains general bearing,
we need roadblocks here, here, here.

502
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,040
We designate this area the hot zone.

503
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,640
Evacuate buildings
outside the hot zone only.

504
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,160
Minimise bodies on the streets,
clear a space, take him out.

505
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,000
- Take him out? What about the bomb?
- We're clearing the streets as best we...

506
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,896
What about the buildings?
Look at all these buildings round here.

507
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,040
Everybody in the shops and offices
inside this hot zone,

508
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,640
they just fend for themselves?

509
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,896
What's the alternative? Cross your fingers
and hope he walks right out of London?

510
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,440
Much more likely he's got
a target in mind. They usually do.

511
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,240
Say he's en route to a hospital
or planning to blow himself up

512
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,040
- in a primary school, what do we do then?
- If you shoot him, people will die.

513
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,760
The question I have to live with is,

514
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,200
how can I keep that number
as small as possible?

515
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,000
Get out of the square now!

516
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,120
- Come on!
- Fast as you can.

517
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,360
Move it! Leave it! Leave it!

518
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,040
John, I can't intervene, it's not my call,
and part of me thanks God that it's not,

519
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,200
because I don't know
what I would do differently.

520
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,880
Look, um, whatever you've got in mind,
we've got to do it quickly.

521
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,760
What's the plan, then?

522
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,800
There is a plan, right?

523
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,800
Wotcha.

524
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,480
I'm John.

525
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,240
- Do you want to play a game?
- I already am.

526
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,960
Oh, I know.

527
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,000
- He's wired.
- See, I've been reading...

528
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,720
Did we know he was wired?

529
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,280
What have you done?

530
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,960
In order to get to the next level,
you need a lot more points.

531
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,240
And correct me if I'm wrong,
but you need a... a boss.

532
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,280
You need to kill a boss.

533
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,320
I am the man at the end of that level,
aren't I?

534
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,200
I'm the man that's chasing you.
I'm that boss.

535
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,680
So if you beat me,

536
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,200
you get to play on.

537
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,600
You're gonna like this.

538
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,560
Check it out.

539
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,120
Now you roll the dice.

540
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,200
I guess the number -
I beat you...

541
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,760
you disarm that switch.

542
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,040
If I lose...

543
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,640
You're not serious.

544
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,560
Look at me.

545
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,960
Do I look like I'm joking?

546
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,600
OK.

547
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,720
Let's play in there.

548
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,320
Joe, those men are gonna
have to come down from that roof

549
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
because they have to have
a clear line of fire.

550
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,280
Joe, I need you to issue that order.

551
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,960
Bring five shooters down from the roof.

552
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,720
Make a perimeter round that truck
and wait.

553
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,360
Have I just authorised the death
of a police officer?

554
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,000
You know... I used to do this thing.

555
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,760
Used to... used to play Russian roulette.

556
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,960
And why was that?

557
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,160
Well...

558
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,440
guess because I was scared,
you know.

559
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,560
I could control my actions,
but not the consequences of my actions.

560
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,320
- Does that make any sense to you?
- Yes.

561
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,400
A few weeks ago, I realised that
nobody can... nobody can control that.

562
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,920
An action leads to a reaction
that leads to a reaction

563
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,480
and it all becomes one chaotic system.

564
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,560
That's why I can see how
you and your brother made it simple.

565
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,520
Turned it into a game.

566
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,120
Right?

567
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,880
I can... I can see that, it makes sense
to me. Leave it to fate, to God.

568
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,640
To a roll of the dice.

569
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,760
The rest of that fuel...

570
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,520
0N you.

571
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,400
I mean, it... it's tiny in here.

572
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,840
Just do it.

573
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,520
Yeah.

574
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
Roll it.

575
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,440
Well, why don't you
put the detonator down?

576
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,520
Oh, no, I can't do that.

577
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,480
Yes, you can.

578
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,840
Listen to me.
You're at that end, I'm at this end.

579
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,520
I'm covered in fuel
and you have a lighter.

580
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,960
OK.

581
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,760
Close your eyes.

582
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,120
Ready?

583
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,960
Come on!

584
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,160
OK, go.

585
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,080
One guess.

586
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Are you scared?

587
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,360
No, I'm not scared. Are you scared?

588
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,480
No.

589
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,640
So...

590
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,440
what do you say?

591
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,200
What do you say?

592
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,240
All right, here's what I say.

593
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,560
The A between the L and the R.

594
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,200
Aim low.

595
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,520
What?

596
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,680
You heard the man.

597
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,000
He hated the boy,
but he wouldn't kill him.

598
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,040
I want you to find him.

599
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,120
Find Frank and bring him to me.

600
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,800
No.

601
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,360
No, this is done.

602
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,720
We're done.

603
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,360
That's not for you to say.

604
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,960
You see, you made a mistake
coming to me, cos I'm not Frank.

605
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,720
I never was Frank and I'll never be Frank.

606
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,960
What are you, then?

607
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,840
This is what I am.

608
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,000
I spoke to a good friend of mine
last night.

609
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,920
Now, if anything happens to Jenny
or anything happens to me,

610
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,320
she is gonna come for you
with the wrath of God.

611
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,640
She'll take whatever
you've got left to love

612
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,680
and make you regret the day
you ever came across my path.

613
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,880
Are we done?

614
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,680
We're done.

615
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,720
- You didn't really do that, did you?
- Do what?

616
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,880
Like, call up
some totally psycho killer girl.

617
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,320
- Her name's Alice.
- Whatever.

618
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,560
I don't know. What do you think?

619
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,960
Hmm... Dunno.

620
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,720
I do know you were totally epic, though.

621
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,080
Totally.

622
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,320
