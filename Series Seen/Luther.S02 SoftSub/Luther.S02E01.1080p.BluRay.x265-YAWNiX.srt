1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,040
Now what?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,840
I'd just like to run through it
one more time, if I may.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,760
Who is this?

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,680
That's John.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,000
- John...?
- Luther.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
And who is John Luther?

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,080
My friend.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
How did you and John meet?

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,400
When I was suspected
of killing my parents.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,360
And, after that, you became friends?

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,920
We grew close.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,880
And how exactly would you
characterise this closeness?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,240
Well, we were...

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,520
simpatico.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,040
And I pitied him.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,320
How so?

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
He always seemed lost to me.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,360
Paddling furiously, just to keep afloat.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,640
I wanted to help him.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,320
And what form did this help take?

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,920
Well, John had any number

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,800
of vexations, and I helped him
in several ways.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,480
Tell me about Ian Reed.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,280
He was a friend

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,280
who betrayed John
and hurt him very badly.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,520
So I killed him.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
Two barrels of his own shotgun.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,240
Boom, boom.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,440
And did John...?

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,120
And this is very important, Alice.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,560
Did John ask you to do this?

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,040
Good heavens, no.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
He was absolutely livid.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
We had quite a tiff.

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
Things were said.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,760
You're not going to penalise John
for my misdeeds...

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
- are you?
- No, Miss Morgan.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,680
Is he still a police officer?

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Yes, he's one of ours.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,200
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,440
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,560
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,120
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you. ♪

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,320
I Only Want To Be With You)

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,840
How are you sleeping?

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Better.

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
Mostly.

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,040
What about you?

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,960
Ah, a bit better.

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
Mostly.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going back to work.

52
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
Are you ready?

53
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,840
Attempted burglary, resisting arrest,
assaulting a police officer.

54
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,120
What's your name?

55
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,480
- He tried to rob a house in this state?
- Not a house, a dojo.

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,640
He tried to rob a karate school?

57
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Right, let's get him interviewed.

58
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,416
We thank you for your custom. We know
other police stations are available.

59
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,720
The thing they don't
tell you about the drugs

60
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,800
is that it makes you smell
like a dog's arse.

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,120
It's not very Keith Richards, is it?
Not very rock'n'roll.

62
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
Justin,

63
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,760
I've never seen you in your uniform.

64
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,280
Look like you're on work experience.

65
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
Yeah, well,
my good uniform got vomited on.

66
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,760
It's all very soul-destroying, isn't it?
Actual police work.

67
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,560
- Burglars, junkies.
- Well, I'm working off my sins, aren't I?

68
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,440
Your major sin being
that you, er, were loyal to me.

69
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,880
That'll be the one.

70
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,240
So, what, you're in here
because you picked up a shoplifter?

71
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
They set up a new unit.

72
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,400
Serious and Serial.

73
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,880
You not fancy staying in Cold Case?
Revealing the identity of Jack The Ripper.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's just see if you're going to be
as cheeky as that

75
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
when you have to pick me up
at 8.00 in the morning.

76
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,400
Cos at 8.00 in the morning, I am grizzly.

77
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,560
I was told I'd be in uniform
for two years, minimum.

78
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,640
Tried to make you resign, didn't they?

79
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,600
Humiliated you. Bullied you.

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
You're a bit of an embarrassment.

81
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
But you didn't leave.

82
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,240
No... No, you didn't.

83
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,880
See you in the morning.

84
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
See you in the morning.

85
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Justin,

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,520
DS Ripley. Morning.

87
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,080
Excuse me.

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Martin.

89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,720
- Oris it Guv'nor?
- Whichever you prefer.

90
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,960
Sergeant Ripley.
My old comrade-in-arms.

91
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
- Good to see you back where you belong.
- Sir.

92
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I fancy DCI Luther forgot to tell you
I'm heading up this unit.

93
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,080
Er, he may have omitted that detail,
sir, yes.

94
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,240
Blitz attack, last night.

95
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,320
The victim is Sadie Buckingham.

96
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,160
Schenk.

97
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm listening.

98
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
She was strangled... and...

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,200
Throat slashed.
From right to left, very sharp blade.

100
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,640
Do you think he's having a joke?

101
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,960
- What do you think?
- What kind of joke?

102
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,600
Well... slaughtered like cattle,
right next to a meat market.

103
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Let's have a look at him.

104
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120
Mr Punch.

105
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,080
- Welcome on board, sir.
- Cheers.

106
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,400
Good to see you, sir.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,480
- Morning.
- Sir.

108
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
- Sir.
- Morning, all.

109
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,400
Morning, Guv.

110
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
DS Gray.

111
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,760
- Oh, er, DS Ripley. Justin.
- Nice to meet you.

112
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Benny, can you play back
those phone calls?

113
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,440
The victim first managed to dial 999...

114
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
All right.

115
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,480
After which, the killer made this call
to the victim's mother.

116
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,000
He is the sunrise. He loves everyone.

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,200
He then called several of her contacts,

118
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,040
her sisters, her friends,
her colleagues, her vet!

119
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,600
He... is... the sunrise.

120
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,560
He... loves... everyone.

121
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,120
All right. First thing we need to do,
Justin, is run background

122
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,600
on the victim's friends, acquaintances.
Make sure this isn't

123
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,400
an ex-boyfriend that's gone nuts. Erin...

124
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,920
I'll source the sunrise chant, see if
it ties in with a specific belief system.

125
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,440
Good place to start, but this...
...this isn't a cult murder.

126
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
Guv?

127
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,120
All of this is for effect.
Murder by theatre.

128
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,960
And I bet the same goes for,
"T am the sun that shines.”

129
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
It's designed to give him

130
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,016
- some sort of prestige.
- Yeah, like people are already

131
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
talking about him.

132
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,320
That's right, and if he's
that desperate to be noticed,

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,560
then this was opening night.

134
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,640
There'll be a lot more
where this comes from.

135
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
I'll source the chant and the mask,
I'll check websites, collectors.

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
- See who's buying, who's selling.
- All right.

137
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,800
How's this looking?

138
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,360
It's early doors. We'll get him.

139
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,640
Yeah.

140
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
John, I, um...

141
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,160
I know you had great loyalty
to Rose Teller,

142
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,680
and rightly so,

143
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,040
but often it's the good coppers
who shoulder the blame for the bad.

144
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,480
Things between us...

145
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
historically,
have sometimes been...

146
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
You had a job to do.

147
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,840
You did it well.

148
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,360
If I was your adversary then...

149
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm not your adversary now.

150
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
I have a new job to do,
and part of that job is to police you,

151
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,360
and to do that properly,

152
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,640
I need your trust... and your candour.

153
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,360
No secrets.

154
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,320
No agendas.

155
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
And no Alice Morgan.

156
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,920
No secrets.

157
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,640
No agendas.

158
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,840
So, what was it like
being bumped back to uniform?

159
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,920
I was never ashamed to wear a uniform.

160
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,120
What about working for
His Satanic Majesty?

161
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
- Sorry, who?
- Luther.

162
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
Is he really as dirty as they say?

163
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,520
Who?

164
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
They!

165
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,280
All the people
who've never worked with him?

166
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,056
Look, I'm just saying,
you know the pitfalls,

167
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,416
you can tell me what to look out for.

168
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,520
Where are we, Justin?

169
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,120
Er, nothing of interest, so far.

170
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
She's got an ex-boyfriend,
was done for affray,

171
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
but that was back during the G7 riots.

172
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,520
No restraining orders.
No, nothing, really.

173
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,920
All right, what about the sunrise stuff?

174
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,840
You were right. No specific reference.

175
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,840
Sunrise imagery seems general
to just about every religion or cult.

176
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
What about the mask?

177
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,040
It looks antique, maybe theatrical.

178
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,000
If that's the case,
there's a market for it, which is good.

179
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,920
Problem is the internet. Collectables flow
back and forth over international borders,

180
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,496
barely leave a trace, so right now
I'm hitting the talk boards,

181
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,016
see if anybody there can ID it for us.

182
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,960
- Well, stick with it, see what comes up.
- OK.

183
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,360
Guv!

184
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,800
DCI Luther.

185
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,120
Caroline.

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,840
Um, DS Ripley.

187
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,520
- Caroline Jones.
- Caroline, now's not a good time for me.

188
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,056
It's all right, boss.
We can give you a minute.

189
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,520
How long have you and DCI Luther
known one another?

190
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,600
Since my husband accidentally
killed a prostitute.

191
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
How is she?

192
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,200
She was self-mutilating at 14.

193
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,400
She cut herself with a razor.

194
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,840
Top of the arms, top of the thighs.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,640
Places I couldn't see.

196
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,240
Before you know,
she's stealing from me.

197
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,680
Lying.

198
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,000
Threatening me with a knife.

199
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,920
And she just runs away.

200
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,800
- Gone.
- Caroline...

201
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,200
OK, listen, I'm gonna stop you here,
cos what... what you're gonna tell me...

202
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,840
I can't help.

203
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,016
- She was selling herself at 17.
- I might not like it,

204
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,600
you might not like it, but...

205
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,280
Well, Jenny's made her choices.

206
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,240
You ever hear of necro-porn?

207
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,560
This is what they're going to do to Jenny.
This afternoon.

208
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,880
Explain to me how this isn't rape.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Men who do this aren't actors.
They pay for it.

210
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,520
Do you understand what that means?

211
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,000
Men are paying to rape my daughter.

212
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,240
So many times, I've tried to help people

213
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,960
by doing things I shouldn't have done,
and...

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,240
...it's only made it worse.

215
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,760
You think?

216
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,840
You didn't need to treat her dad
the way you did.

217
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,040
Degrading him in public, humiliating him.

218
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,600
It was the only way
I knew how to stop him.

219
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,440
What you did to me,

220
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
to her dad...

221
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
it messed her up.

222
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
So this is your fault.

223
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,440
As much as her dad's, this is your fault.

224
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,480
- For what you did to us.
- I'm a policeman.

225
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,640
What did you want me to do?

226
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,240
And your wife?

227
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,800
Is she proud?

228
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
All right, I'll talk to her.

229
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,320
Can't promise I'll change her mind.

230
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
Have you got an address?

231
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,200
No... This is all I've got.

232
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,080
All right.

233
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,840
No jokes, OK?

234
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,680
There's no joking about
this sort of thing.

235
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,160
Is that wee girl OK?

236
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,200
She is now, apparently.

237
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
But, Benny, I need to find her today
or that is gonna happen to her, or worse.

238
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
You've worked vice.

239
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,040
Any laws you have to break
to help me do that?

240
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Well, people like this like to keep
a low profile, for obvious reasons.

241
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
But if there's a revenue stream,
there's a paper trail.

242
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,960
So I'll make a few phone calls,
see what I can dig out for you.

243
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,920
All right. Just let me know
as soon as you know anything, all right?

244
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,160
No problem.

245
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,960
Excuse me.

246
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,680
Are you an art student?

247
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,600
- Am I that obvious?
- No, no, no.

248
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,200
- Where do you go?
- Um, Saint Martin's.

249
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,880
No?!

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,200
- Me too. I went to Saint Martin's.
- Really?

251
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,280
- Yeah. It's a small world, or what?
- Yeah...

252
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,960
What are you doing?
Um... Fine art... or...?

253
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
- No, textiles.
- Oh!

254
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,880
Yeah, we have to, um, design a print
that somehow evokes London.

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,120
Oh, well...

256
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
you came to the right place
for that, eh?

257
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,560
I mean, this, this is... is... London.

258
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,240
It used to be a quiet little lane,
lined with elm trees and so on,

259
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,040
but they've been selling stuff here
since 1608.

260
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
Then in the 17th century,
the Huguenots arrived.

261
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,200
18th century, it becomes,
like, a centre for cloth-making,

262
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
and then in 1830,
they tried to change the name.

263
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,080
"Petticoat" was considered too raunchy
for the Victorians. But it didn't work!

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,960
- Petticoat Lane endures.
- Are you, like, a local historian?

265
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,520
No, no, no, no. I just... I love the place.
You can feel the time,

266
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,560
like layers of time, strata of time,
a big cake of time.

267
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,160
No, it's magic. It's got magic to it.

268
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Hey...

269
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,400
do you wanna see something really cool?

270
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,440
No. Um, no, I'm fine, thanks.

271
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,520
- The most London thing ever.
- No.

272
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,096
Single most London thing you'll ever see.

273
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,600
Honestly, I'm fine! Thank you.

274
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,440
He is the sunrise. He loves everyone.

275
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,360
He is the sunrise, he loves everyone.

276
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
He is the sunrise.

277
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,560
He loves everyone.

278
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
Smithfields. Petticoat Lane.

279
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,040
He's a London boy, ain't he?

280
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,640
We know he likes the attention, so, er...

281
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,280
Do me a favour, confiscate every one
of those mobile phones.

282
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,960
- On what grounds, legally?
- Find grounds.

283
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,440
All right?
We need to start collecting data

284
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
on all the crowds that show up
at the crime scenes.

285
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,120
Comparing faces, see if the same face
doesn't show up more than once.

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
Sometimes serial offenders return to
the scene, enjoy the chaos they've caused.

287
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,536
- Makes them feel omnipotent.
- Yeah, I know, it's just...

288
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,496
When he says "confiscate", what he means
is appeal to the owners of the phones,

289
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,320
- OK?
- Fine,

290
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,519
but that's not what he said, is it?

291
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:58,680
But that's not what he said, is it?

292
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,360
Seen something, I'd like you to speak
to my detectives. Anyone else,

293
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,400
can you just give us a little room,
please, er, so we can work? All right?

294
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,440
You can go home, if you can, please.

295
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,360
Move back and make some space.

296
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,160
Can you move back, everyone, please?

297
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,456
- No more photos.
- Give us some space, thank you.

298
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Excuse me.

299
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,360
Message for DS Ripley. Chasing suspect,
Northbirch Estate, south side.

300
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,760
Thin, IC1, brown hair. Hurry up.

301
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Where?

302
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,280
Aargh!

303
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,080
Don't ruin it!

304
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Aaargh!

305
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,480
Aaargh!

306
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
Boss?

307
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,800
- Go, go, go. Check it outside.
- Through there.

308
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,200
- What-what do you want?
- Oh!

309
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,160
Evidence bag.

310
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
He must be coming your way.

311
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
- Here. In here.
- Yeah, DNA.

312
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,520
Helicopter's after him.
Uniform, dogs, the lot, but he got away.

313
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,000
- Yeah. He's fast.
- He's more than fast.

314
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,280
- Had a getaway route scouted out.
- Bet he did.

315
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
DNA?

316
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,200
It's been expedited,
imminent danger to life and so on.

317
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,080
Can you even see anything?

318
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,480
Cheers, mate. Um, listen, call me as soon
as that DNA result comes in, all right?

319
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,760
Where are you going?

320
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,440
To hospital.

321
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,040
Do you have permission to be here, sir?

322
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Thank you.

323
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,480
Alice.

324
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,920
What's this?

325
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,200
Permanent solution
to a temporary problem.

326
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,080
- How many times have you tried it?
- Fewer than a hundred.

327
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
Sadly, each attempt ended in failure.

328
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,120
So they gave me no choice,
but just to... ...keep on living.

329
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,360
And to keep you safe,
they put you in here.

330
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,840
Well, it is a secure hospital, John.

331
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,760
As secure as a prison?

332
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,200
One can only assume so.

333
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,560
Are you seeing anyone?

334
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,000
- None of your business.
- Because I'm not.

335
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,640
Most of the people in here are women.

336
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,360
Not that I mind, per se.

337
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,800
Needs must.

338
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,960
But they do tend to veer
on the mentally ill.

339
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,520
Child abuse, spouse abuse, alcohol abuse.

340
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,480
It's all just breathtakingly unerotic.

341
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,280
What about you?

342
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,360
- What about me?
- Have you left yet?

343
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,040
- Left where?
- Police force.

344
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,440
No.

345
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
Will you?

346
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,360
Yeah.

347
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,360
Yeah, I'm leaving.

348
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,320
- When?
- Soon.

349
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,000
Just got a couple of things
to take care of.

350
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,240
Getting Ripley back on track.

351
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,200
And there's this girl...

352
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,920
- What girl?
- Just...

353
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
a girl.

354
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,040
- I said I'd help.
- Which is exactly the problem.

355
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,960
Yeah.

356
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,480
But then I'm done.

357
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,800
Good, because the people around you
are vampires.

358
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
They'll suck your veins dry,

359
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,360
crack open your bones
and lick out the marrow.

360
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
You've done enough for them,
so step away

361
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
and find yourself a life worth living.

362
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Well, that's the plan, anyway.

363
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,680
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

364
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,760
- I always wanted to see somewhere hot.
- Mm.

365
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,320
I've never seen the desert.
Perhaps see some sharks.

366
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, I'm a great fan of sharks.

367
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,480
Daddy took me snorkelling once
for my birthday,

368
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,480
to see them in their natural habitat.

369
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Did you see many?

370
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,440
Enough to realise
I prefer them in aquariums.

371
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,840
I've always wanted to go and see
the Very Large Array in New Mexico.

372
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,240
It's not the biggest in the world,
of course,

373
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,720
or the most modern, but it is iconic,
and I grew up wanting to see it.

374
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
It's quite spectacular.

375
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,560
Out there in the desert.

376
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
We could go together.

377
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,040
Want some?

378
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,480
Mm-mm.

379
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,440
I've gotta go.

380
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,280
Madmen to catch.

381
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,000
Need any advice?

382
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
No.

383
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Pretty up to speed with my... lunatics.

384
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,680
Well...

385
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,760
don't be a stranger.

386
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,784
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

387
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,560
Benny?

388
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,760
The death porn is produced by a foreign
registered offshoot of Hemina Films.

389
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,320
It's run out of Mile End.

390
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,920
So, bad news - for obvious reasons
it's all kept a bit "entre nous".

391
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,879
Good news - that means they have to draw
from a very small pool of technicians

392
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,216
Good news - that means they have to draw
from a very small pool of technicians

393
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,920
- and locations.
- So have you got an address?

394
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,600
Give me an hour.

395
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,080
- DS Gray, I've been thinking...
- Yeah?

396
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
He said to me, "Don't ruin it."

397
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
"Don't ruin it."

398
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,800
What does that say to you?

399
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,360
- That he's on a mission?
- Yeah, but what is that mission?

400
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,600
Celebrity. Infamy.

401
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,800
No, it's more than that, isn't it?

402
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,880
Something else
he's trying to achieve.

403
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,240
- Um, have you got that file for the...?
- Guv.

404
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,240
Can I have a word? Sort of...

405
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,040
- off the record, type thing?
- Yeah, of course.

406
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Oh!

407
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,160
Um... I'm guessing
you've read my personal file?

408
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,320
So... you know how hard
I have worked to get here.

409
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,160
Now, my point is, and please
don't take this the wrong way...

410
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Promise to try.

411
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,360
But today you asked me
to confiscate people's mobile phones

412
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,800
when there was no actual...

413
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,520
- Gray, Gray.
- No real legal grounds.

414
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,320
- Gray, it was a figure of speech.
- Yeah, I know, I get that... really.

415
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,920
It's just... well, if I had just
confiscated them, would you have minded?

416
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,560
Honestly, no.

417
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,520
But I would have protected you
from any circumstances.

418
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,480
That's my point. I don't want to
have to need that kind of protection.

419
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,960
With the best will in the world,
I don't want to end up like DS Ripley.

420
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,880
He was like this rising star.

421
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,680
- And now, he's...
- He's what?

422
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,200
- Well...
- What?

423
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,120
Tarnished... sort of.

424
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,320
- Tarnished?
- Sorry. Um...

425
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,800
I don't want to risk my career
when it's only just getting started.

426
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,040
It's just...

427
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,480
this is my job, you know?

428
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,320
Noted.

429
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,560
- Benny, have you got that address?
- Surely do.

430
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,400
- Question is, do you want it?
- Give it to me.

431
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,520
Can I help you?

432
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah. You can shut up.

433
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,160
Who are you?

434
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,480
So what you're telling me is your mum
has no right to be worried about you. Hmm.

435
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,000
Listen, Officer Whoever,

436
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,200
I see stuff you wouldn't even believe,
so best not patronise me, eh?

437
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Of course.

438
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
Of course.

439
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,760
I don't mean to.

440
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,720
Anyway, it's just sex.

441
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,200
Letting someone have sex with you
while you're unconscious,

442
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
that's not sex only, is it?

443
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm a sex worker.

444
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,440
So, yeah, I do some funny things,
but at least I'm my own boss.

445
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,176
I don't have to believe a load of bullshit

446
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,920
that people shove
down each others' throats

447
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,960
about love and marriage and monogamy,
blah, blah, blah.

448
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,800
Are you married?

449
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
I was.

450
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,360
Exactly - "was".

451
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,720
How long?

452
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,880
18 years.

453
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,280
And how many times
did you do the dirty on her?

454
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Never.

455
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,520
Well, it's my life,
and actually, I really like it.

456
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,040
Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?
The meth?

457
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,440
See, I think you've got
one... maybe two months

458
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,160
before your teeth start falling out.

459
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,320
Come on, Jenny.

460
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,880
Eh?

461
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
See, the thing is, I don't think
you're doing this by choice.

462
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,640
Not really.

463
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,400
That's just a cuddly thought
so you can sleep at night.

464
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,760
Nah. Need the coinage, rent to pay.

465
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,840
What do you want?

466
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,120
All right.

467
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,176
Well, I can tell
I'm not gonna change your mind,

468
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,496
so why don't you just call your mum,
let her hear your voice?

469
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,560
It's not my voice she wants to hear.

470
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,640
She's no different from the freaks
that get off on these films.

471
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,200
It's not who I actually am that matters.

472
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,680
It's who they wish I was.

473
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,000
Jen!

474
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,360
- 1...
- Tell her I'm fine.

475
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,520
All right, that's it, the show's over!
Come on, show's over.

476
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,760
Oi, oi, oi. Jenny Jones...

477
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,696
- Get off me!
- I'm arresting you on suspicion

478
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,200
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!

479
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,120
You do not have to say anything,
but if you do not mention...

480
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,680
Agh!

481
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,760
Help!

482
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,360
Help!

483
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,440
What did I do? Didn't find any drugs!
Search me, I don't take drugs.

484
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,240
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?

485
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Can you shut up for one second?

486
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,160
- I'm clean! I'm clean! I'm clean!
- Justin.

487
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,920
Did you get a beat on that DNA?

488
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,600
Er, yeah. Cameron Pell, artist.
Well, failed artist.

489
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,160
A history of mental illness?

490
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,320
No. The man's got serious issues.

491
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,080
Five years back he was arrested for
gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.

492
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
He's burst in wearing a clown mask,

493
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,280
slashed a load of paintings
with a flensing knife.

494
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
When they tried to throw him out,
he's gone completely Tonto.

495
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,240
Cut up two doormen. Lucky to escape
an attempted murder charge.

496
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,920
- Right. Did you get an address?
- I'm gonna send it to you now.

497
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,600
All right, um...

498
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,760
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah, see you there.

499
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,080
- You off to arrest someone?
- Yeah.

500
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,136
You're screwed then
cos I'll do you for false arrest.

501
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,816
I had reasonable and probable cause
to think you were committing a crime.

502
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Listen, one more peep out of you...

503
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,680
- and it's with intent to supply.
- You're a liar.

504
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,760
And you're a junkie hooker. I'm a copper.

505
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Do that, would you? Stitch me up?

506
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,160
Yeah.
In a millisecond, just to shut you up.

507
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,976
Do you even know what
they'll do to me for this?

508
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,160
They'll break my ankles, if I'm lucky.

509
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,760
Listen. Look at me. Nothing's
going to happen to you, all right?

510
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,320
Yeah, who says? You?

511
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,400
- Yeah, me.
- They do know where I live, you know.

512
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,240
People like that, they always do.

513
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,880
Come on.

514
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Mark, I wouldn't do this
unless I absolutely had to.

515
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,520
Do what?

516
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,640
John, who is this?

517
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,600
Where am I?

518
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,000
What part of London is this?

519
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,000
Well, if I tell you that...

520
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,040
it wouldn't be a safe house, would it?

521
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,880
And you wouldn't be in protective custody.

522
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,200
And besides, it's only for an hour.

523
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,360
You do know what they'll do
when they find me, don't you?

524
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,040
Pick up, come on, come on.
Bitch, pick up!

525
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,160
All right, now listen.
Have you done as you were asked?

526
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,600
Have you?

527
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,600
No sign of Cameron.
Flat's completely empty.

528
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,560
Why the empty flat?

529
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,120
It's almost like
he's never been here before.

530
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Hello, your call cannot be taken
at the moment,

531
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,800
so please leave your message
after the tone.

532
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,800
I know you're there.

533
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,240
Benny, it's Ripley, mate. I need you to
trace a call going to this number, yeah?

534
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,440
Hello, Cameron.

535
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,640
How's your arm?

536
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,880
You think,
because you tasted my blood,

537
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,160
that you know what I am.

538
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,440
Well, to be fair,
I am standing in your flat.

539
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,800
You don't know what I am.

540
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,000
- And you don't know where I am.
- Where are you?

541
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,600
Everywhere! I can walk down any street.
I can peer...

542
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,456
- He's close, less than a mile.
- I can knock

543
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,840
on any door. I am the shape at the window.

544
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,120
I am the hand under the bed.

545
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,000
So what's the play, Cameron?

546
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,800
Cos that's what it is, isn't it?
It's a play.

547
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,080
With Cameron Pell starring as Mr Punch.

548
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,320
Do you know anything about this city?

549
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,080
Well, I know that it smells a bit funny
when it gets hot.

550
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,080
This, now, everything, this place,
this time, this cretinised culture.

551
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,320
- We are the richest, most decadent...
- Less than three minutes.

552
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,440
People that ever lived.
And still we're dissatisfied.

553
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,880
We have lost our history.
We have lost our myths.

554
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,760
You see, kids in Whitechapel

555
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,080
play video games in which
they score points by killing prostitutes.

556
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,800
They're totally indifferent to the spectre
that walks past their window.

557
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
This is a dead city.

558
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,200
It's an unreal city. Do you know why?

559
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,600
No, why don't you tell me why?

560
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,000
We are so indifferent that we don't care.

561
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,000
- It's like we're medicated.
- How are you going to make us wake up?

562
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,760
I'm going to remind people
what it's like to be really scared.

563
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,080
Have you ever heard
of Spring-Heeled Jack?

564
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,600
Spring-Heeled Jack? I've heard
of Spring-Heeled Jack. Victorian bogeyman.

565
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,480
Mask, red eyes.

566
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,400
Are you cribbing your ideas
from penny-dreadfuls?

567
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,680
They called him the Terror of London,
and do you know what made him terrifying?

568
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,360
He could do whatever he liked
to whomever he chose,

569
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,160
wherever he chose, whenever he chose,
and he was never caught.

570
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,720
He just disappeared, passed into folklore.

571
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Oh, yeah?

572
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,720
- Is that what you want to do, eh?
- I've already done it.

573
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,000
You just don't know it yet.

574
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,896
Are you sure about that?
Because the last time we spoke

575
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,120
you were pretty scared
that I was gonna ruin it.

576
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,120
- Nice one, mate.
- Yeah, I was, but not any more.

577
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,720
Why should I be scared?
I can take anyone I choose. You can watch.

578
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,760
- Later tonight.
- What do you mean?

579
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,400
I hope you're excited, because I am.

580
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
Watch what, Cameron?
Hey, Cameron, what do you mean?

581
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,200
What are you going to show me tonight? Eh?

582
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,400
Cameron!

583
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,616
- How long?
- Less than a minute.

584
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Too late.

585
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,880
He's gone.

586
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,080
What time is it?

587
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,880
Well, it's late.

588
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,720
- He said he'd only be an hour.
- Yeah.

589
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,680
I need the loo.

590
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,880
No key.

591
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,160
Aren't you tired?

592
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,840
Opposite. You?

593
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,600
- I'm absolutely knackered.
- Get some sleep.

594
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,600
Lie down, chill out,
make yourself at home.

595
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,240
Yeah, wake up
and find all my credit cards gone.

596
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,680
How do you know him? That gavver?

597
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,560
- Gavver?
- Smurf.

598
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,120
Billy Filth.

599
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,960
Cos you're obviously not one of them,
no offence whatever.

600
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,160
No offence taken.

601
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,080
Well, um... it's a long story.

602
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,360
So give me the edited highlights.

603
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,040
OK.

604
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,240
OK, long story, short version.

605
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,920
I was going to marry his ex-wife.

606
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,800
Seriously?!

607
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,440
What, and now you're mates,
and everything?

608
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,000
Well, mates is probably pushing it.

609
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,880
So where is she? His ex, your missus?

610
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,320
She died.

611
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
Ouch!

612
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,320
Sorry.

613
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,400
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.

614
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,960
You weren't to know.

615
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,080
- What about you? How do you know him?
- Don't.

616
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,480
Not really.

617
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,920
As far as I'm concerned, he's this random
smurf popped up out of nowhere.

618
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,760
So why the...?

619
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,480
Long time ago...

620
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,920
my dad killed this girl.

621
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,840
It was by accident and everything,
but... he panicked.

622
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,560
Cut her up and whatnot.

623
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,440
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.

624
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,480
I'm sorry.

625
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,800
So this bloke, Luther,
was one of the coppers that put him away.

626
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,360
And your dad?

627
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,560
Killed himself in prison.

628
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,040
Jenny, listen, I know how hard...
how hard it can be.

629
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,120
Losing someone that way.

630
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,520
Where is Cameron?

631
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,880
I haven't seen Cameron for two years.

632
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,920
I don't know what you expect me
to tell you.

633
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,920
No offence, but I think you do.

634
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,640
So, you were at art school together?

635
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,200
Well... I was at art school.

636
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,040
He'd hang around the refectory.

637
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,400
Sort of, you know...

638
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,840
talking art.

639
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,560
Did he ever talk about...

640
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,040
this?

641
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
Spring-Heeled Jack?

642
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Yeah.

643
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,400
About ten zillion times.

644
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,320
Yes, it was his childhood obsession.

645
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,640
Spring-Heeled Jack's in the cupboard.

646
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,200
Spring-Heeled Jack's waiting at the bottom
of the garden, in the bushes.

647
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,400
He had to see somebody about it.

648
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,640
A psychologist or a psychoanalyst.

649
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,520
Anyway, they teased him about it.

650
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
It made him feel like a freak.

651
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,480
I suppose he was a freak, really.

652
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,760
Still is.

653
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,880
A freaky little freak.

654
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,000
Did Cameron ever hurt you?

655
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
No.

656
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,320
- Why did you hesitate?
- Because sometimes...

657
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,920
he'd get this look in his eyes.

658
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,640
What look?

659
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,200
Like he wanted to.

660
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
- Boss... sorry, this is urgent.
- Yes?

661
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,559
It's him. You're gonna wanna see this.

662
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,160
It's him. You're gonna wanna see this.

663
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,560
- What is it, Benny?
- This has just come in.

664
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,080
Is this live?

665
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,240
Yep, it's happening right now. It's live.

666
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,680
Jesus, some sort of hand-held webcam,
or something.

667
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,240
It's being sent to us directly.

668
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,880
He's taunting us.

669
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,560
- Do we know the street?
- Can't tell.

670
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,600
I want everyone on this.
We need to find that street.

671
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,480
- Partial plate.
- Dig it up. Give me an address.

672
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,320
- Benny, can you send it over?
- Yeah, it's with you now.

673
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,000
Gray, quick as you can.
Come on. Erin!

674
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,280
He's knocking on doors.

675
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,696
- Gray, come on!
- It's coming, it's coming!

676
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,120
There's 80 vehicles with that partial.
Benny, can you narrow down the model?

677
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,440
It's a light-brown... gold BMW 5 series.

678
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,720
- Please don't open that door.
- Late '80s, early '90s.

679
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,160
- No answer.
- Thank God.

680
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,560
- Got it! Registered to Grant Morrison...
- He's gone to the other house.

681
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,536
- 37 Eastmead Street.
- Wait, let me double-check.

682
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,616
- What?
- He might be parked on the next street.

683
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,216
Could be outside his girlfriend's house,
might have lent his car to a mate.

684
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,640
Eastmead Street runs alongside a canal
and that's...

685
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,360
Where the hell is this?
Come on, find it, find it.

686
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Check every street within half a mile
north to southwest of Eastmead Street.

687
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,840
Don't open it. No.

688
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
No!

689
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
No, no!

690
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,760
No, no!

691
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Er, it's Egmont Terrace,
two streets southwest.

692
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,160
All right, call it in.

693
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,560
This is DS Gray, SSU, requesting urgent
armed response to Egmont Terrace, E1.

694
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,640
And send an ambulance.

695
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,120
Did something happen?

696
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,920
DS Gray...

697
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,320
DS Ripley,
please escort Miss Calvert home.

698
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,920
This way, please.

699
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,240
Right, this way, please.

700
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,040
How are you feeling?

701
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,200
I'm angry.

702
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,160
Too angry?

703
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,000
Just angry enough.

704
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,800
Because I can't have the wheels
coming off this thing, John.

705
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,320
They won't, Martin.

706
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,760
I fought tooth and nail
to get you back into the fold.

707
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,560
I fought hard and I fought dirty.

708
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,600
Don't squander it now.

709
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,560
- I was just wondering...
- Yeah?

710
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,200
Would you mind just coming up with me?

711
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,320
Just to check under the bed,
that sort of thing.

712
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,840
- I just keep thinking...
- Of course, that's not silly at all.

713
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,280
All units, Sierra Oscar 52, IC1,

714
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,280
dark clothing,
medium-length, light-brown hair.

715
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,040
- Suspect at large.
- Give me 9-0 in the town centre, please.

716
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,960
I live just upstairs.

717
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,600
It's the shop.

718
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,440
Do you want a cup of tea?

719
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,840
I'll just check upstairs.

720
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,520
Sorry, it's just a fuse.

721
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,480
Oh!

722
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,080
Ripley, all clear on the house.

723
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,160
I'm just going to
make sure Miss Calvert's all right.

724
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,760
OK, copy that.

725
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,320
It has come back on you
like the hand of God!
