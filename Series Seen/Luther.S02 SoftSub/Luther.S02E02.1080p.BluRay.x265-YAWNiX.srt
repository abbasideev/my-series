1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,760
You ever hear of necro-porn?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,040
This is what they're going to do to Jenny.
This afternoon.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,800
Jenny Jones.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,680
Help!

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,640
To keep you safe,
they put you in here.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,440
Well, it is a secure hospital, John.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,040
As secure as a prison?

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,560
One can only assume so.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,160
- Well, we know he loves the attention.
- You're gonna want to see this.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,920
It's happening right now. It's live.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,080
No! No!

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,480
He fought.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,040
Yeah, well. He's tough, isn't he?

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,480
John, our anger's got no place here.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,880
I need you to be functioning fully
in the moment, or not here at all.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
We owe that to Ripley.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Making a body disappear is not
that easy, especially in the city.

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,600
Cameron took a risk. Was it worth it?

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,040
- Worth it how?
- This, all this...

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,520
circus!

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
No, this is staged.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,560
Justin's alive.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,800
Cameron wants him, needs him.

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,800
If Justin knows how to read Cameron,
then he'll know how to stay alive.

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,680
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,440
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,640
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,600
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you. ♪

29
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
Agh!

30
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
A huge police search
for a missing officer is under way.

31
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,880
Significant resources are being employed
to find 32-year-old Detective Sergeant...

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,080
- Let's go over it again.
- Allegedly abducted last night...

33
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
So what do we know?

34
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
OK, Pell works long hours, minimum wage.

35
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,200
He cleans corporate offices in the City.

36
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,160
That makes sense, doesn't it?
Big office, midnight.

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,920
He's got all of London
to stare at and fantasise about.

38
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
- Spending patterns.
- Bit weird.

39
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,240
He lives very frugally. Actually manages
to save a bit every month,

40
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
and then eight, nine months ago,

41
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,200
he gets a huge cash injection,
we're talking 65 grand.

42
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,360
Cash arrives in his account
nine months after his mother dies.

43
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Right, so it's his mother's estate.
What did he do with the money?

44
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Withdraws it.

45
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,880
- All of it?
- Every penny.

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
He wasn't saving up for a rainy day. He
was saving for something to do with this.

47
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,840
- Talk to me about this artwork.
- Ex-wife gives it to us. We have...

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,040
Answer To A Job,

49
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,400
The Integration Of The Personality,

50
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,720
Des Anima Des
Schicksalsproblem Des Mannes, Aion.

51
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,880
So his room's not just empty.
It's in his work too.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
An absence. It's empty... rooms.

53
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Ripley's gone, empty car.

54
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
Empty roads.

55
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,640
Spring-Heeled Jack, disappeared into
folklore because he was never caught.

56
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,480
Jack the Ripper, he was a myth too, but
I think Cameron is gonna try and disappear

57
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,160
and haunt us with his absence.

58
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,600
We need to stop trying to predict
what he's gonna do next

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,360
and work backwards instead.
It costs money to make a new identity,

60
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,760
so we follow the money,
the missing 65 grand.

61
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,096
We follow that and we find him.

62
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
Start off with the contacts
that he made in prison.

63
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,680
Ah, the whore's mummy.

64
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,840
Paul Hoby's his name.

65
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Shut up!

66
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,520
Shut up! It's Ripley's phone.

67
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Benny.

68
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
Hello.

69
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry
you made me hurt your puppy.

70
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,480
He's a noisy little customer, isn't he?

71
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,000
- Guv, he might be...
- Don't.

72
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Don't answer that.

73
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Don't answer that!

74
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
He's trying to make contact.

75
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,256
He might be trying to reach out,
he might be trying to stop.

76
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,600
- No, he's not gonna stop.
- How do you know that?

77
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,040
Listen, if you answer that phone,
Cameron's got our attention.

78
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,800
He thinks he's setting up
a relationship with us.

79
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
As soon as he thinks that,
he doesn't need Ripley.

80
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,080
- This is...
- DS Gray, do not pick up that phone!

81
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
That's it!

82
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
I know you're there.

83
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,560
I know you're listening. I don't know
what you're trying to achieve.

84
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm opening up a dialogue here.

85
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
Trying to find a way through this,
trying to find

86
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,000
a way you can get
your friend back in one piece.

87
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,480
What happens to Ripley,
if you ignore me, will be on your head.

88
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,680
And I will send you pictures of every cut,
every burn, every incision.

89
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,320
I will send you every second
of him screaming.

90
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,600
How much more of this can you take?

91
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,160
You have ten seconds
to answer this phone.

92
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,440
If you do not answer,
then Ripley here will regret it.

93
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,880
Nine seconds. Eight. Seven. Six. Five.

94
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Four. Three.

95
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Two.

96
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,000
One.

97
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,280
Pick up the phone! Pick up the phone!

98
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,360
I am here!

99
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Iam...

100
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,480
No. That man, that voice, those voices,

101
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,640
that's the man we're gonna leave on the
streets if we do not do our jobs properly.

102
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,400
This isn't about DS Ripley.

103
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,000
It's about Sadie. It's about Abby.
It's about Jason.

104
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,720
It's about all the others
that will be next if we mess this up.

105
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Listen, DS Ripley knows that
and he wouldn't have it any other way,

106
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
so, if you respect him at all...

107
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,040
just get back to work.

108
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,360
What if Pell regards your silence
as weakness rather than strength?

109
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
He won't.

110
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,120
From DS Gray.

111
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,560
He cancelled his mobile phone contract
a few days after his mother's death

112
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,880
and then, ten days after the funeral,

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,040
he was contacted on that number
by an ex-cellmate, Paul Hoby.

114
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,440
Excellent.

115
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
Hi, erm...

116
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,400
- You have to come to mine now.
- I can't.

117
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
You have to.

118
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,600
All right, I'll see what I can do.

119
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,360
Your boss is throwing you to the wolves.

120
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,360
Why would he do that, huh?

121
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
Why would he do that?

122
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,800
Huh?! Why would he abandon you
like that? Why? Why?

123
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,920
It's me! Doesn't he know the real thing
when he sees it?!

124
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,240
You must know that phrase,
"the banality of evil".

125
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
- I've heard it mentioned, yeah.
- It's a platitude.

126
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,880
Just bourgeois fatuousness.
Do you know what the problem really is?

127
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
No, I'd like you to explain that,
Cameron, yes, please.

128
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,160
It's about the evil of banality.

129
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,360
Nothing means anything.

130
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,480
Everybody is numb. This is a dead city.
In a dead country. Do you know why?

131
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,920
Because we've become disconnected
from our own myths.

132
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,160
We have lost our own shadows.

133
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,800
The Ripper. Crippen. Christie. Hindley.

134
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Brady. Sutcliffe. Neilson. Fred and Rose.

135
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,760
They weren't myths. They were people.

136
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,520
They were people,
and their victims were people.

137
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,920
In the beginning.
But murder transfigured them.

138
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,720
Made them numinous.

139
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
We needed them.

140
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,200
They told us stories about ourselves,
about...

141
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,080
about our fears and our desires.

142
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,320
They cast a shadow.
Shadows give us depth.

143
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,760
And I have worked so hard
to become shadows.

144
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,240
I do not want them to ruin it now. So...

145
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,360
the reason you are here, what I want you,
what I need you to tell me...

146
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,040
is how much do they know?

147
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,720
How much do they know about what?

148
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,400
How much do they know
about what I am about to do?

149
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,920
What are you about to do?

150
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh.

151
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,080
Well, I know who you are.

152
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
Frank Hodge.

153
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,280
You were a copper.

154
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,880
Different life, John.

155
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,400
All right.

156
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,760
- All right, John, you know how...
- What are you doing? No!

157
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,600
- Get on that chair!
- I said stop pointing!

158
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
- All right!
- Now!

159
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,960
- Now!
- All right.

160
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,040
Oi! No! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

161
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,240
No! Oi! No!

162
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,120
Argh! Argh!

163
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,560
I gather you're the policeman
that stole my property.

164
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,800
Jenny's not your property.

165
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,040
You don't know what you've done, do you?

166
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,640
Got my daughter back.

167
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,360
Jenny is... very... low

168
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,240
on your food chain. This time last night,
you didn't even know she existed.

169
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,160
Let a man steal an egg,
tomorrow he'll steal an ox.

170
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, but you set me up, didn't you?
You set me up to steal from you.

171
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,360
You talked to Caroline. You knew
she'd come to me and you knew...

172
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
you knew what I'd do.

173
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,400
No matter how much temptation
I put in your path,

174
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,640
the fact remains you stole from me
as an act of free will.

175
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,000
This is Toby. My grandson.
He has a friend.

176
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,480
Andrei Kolchak. One of our licensees.

177
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,520
Arrested for people trafficking,

178
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,920
he's currently in witness protection,
finalising his deal.

179
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,120
And when that deal is completed,
he intends to implicate Toby here

180
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,560
in a number of unlawful acts
and sundry violations.

181
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,640
I'd be grateful if that didn't happen.

182
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm sorry. All right?

183
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400
But I can't do anything about that.

184
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,280
Well, then, Caroline here dies.

185
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,040
And the slut child dies.

186
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,480
I could step outside, make one phone call
and have a thousand coppers

187
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,360
- abseiling through your windows.
- I'd make my one phone call,

188
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,840
have my one conversation
and, in eight hours, I'd be out.

189
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,680
The whore's mother would still be dead.
And the whore would still be dead.

190
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Look, this sort of thing,
I can't do it overnight. It needs time.

191
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,120
No, it has to be done today.

192
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,960
And if I do help?

193
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,480
Slate's clear.

194
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
Streetwalker's all yours.

195
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,240
The mother's all yours.

196
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,040
Benny?
Yeah, I need you to do something for me.

197
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
Yeah, it is one of them, yeah.

198
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
All right, yes, it is.

199
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,400
Erm, Andrei Kolchak.
Arrested in the last week or three.

200
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
Yeah, I need you to find the safe house

201
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,800
where they're keeping him
and cover up your tracks.

202
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,480
You don't want no-one sniffing
around you, all right? Oh, God!

203
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,200
Oh...!

204
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Morning, officer.

205
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,840
- I don't believe we've met before.
- Well, I'm familiar with the species.

206
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,480
DS Gray, this is Paul Hoby.

207
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,120
Paul used to own a little factory

208
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,200
for converting replica weapons
into working guns.

209
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,120
Yes, and Paul did his time.

210
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,520
What is it with boys and knives, I wonder?

211
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,360
These knives are sold for recreational
and hobby purposes only.

212
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,720
- Yeah? How's the stockroom looking?
- Eh?

213
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,520
- Everything in order?
- Everything in order? Ha!

214
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,960
Seriously, Mein Herr?
Ja, everything is in order.

215
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,120
Would you like to see my papers?

216
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,920
Would if I could.

217
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,720
Right now, I'll settle for a full
inventory and a glimpse at the books.

218
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,320
Please yourself, love. Goose-step
over here, take a look for yourself.

219
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,320
DS Gray is
a little testy today, Paul...

220
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,480
because of Cameron Pell,
your former cellmate.

221
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,760
Pell's been killing people.

222
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
He may have killed a police officer.

223
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,520
Do you have any idea
of what your life will be like

224
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,560
if every London copper
holds you responsible for that?

225
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,920
All I did was point him
in the direction of a few names

226
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,280
who might have been able
to help him with what he wanted.

227
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,960
What names?

228
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
You need to talk to a man
called Ronald Bryson.

229
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,120
As speculation mounts as to
why the search for the missing officer

230
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,520
has been so quickly scaled down,
police sources are refusing to comment...

231
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,920
They've stopped looking for you.
Why is that?

232
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
If they target the manpower
in certain areas,

233
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,720
you'll know how close they are
to finding you.

234
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:27,880
You'll know how close they are
to finding you.

235
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,600
Do you think they're close to finding me?

236
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,840
Do you?

237
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,320
Do they know where it goes next?

238
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,400
- I don't know.
- Do you know where it goes next?

239
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,000
- No!
- Any idea?

240
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
- Any inkling?
- No. No.

241
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
- Would you like to know?
- I'd love to know.

242
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,560
Why?

243
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,280
Because you're one of a kind. If this
situation was turned on its head...

244
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,040
I'd want your permission
to write a book about you.

245
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,920
A thesis maybe.

246
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,760
I think you'd be of interest
to a lot of people in my field.

247
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,160
Law enforcement psychology.

248
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
The first thing I'd ask...

249
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,440
Why the mask? Why do you need a mask?

250
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,920
Because wearing a mask makes it easy.

251
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,000
How you feeling?

252
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,480
Like a freshly squeezed zit.

253
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,160
Do you want something?
Water or painkillers or something?

254
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,360
- Got any temazepam?
- No.

255
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,280
Could do with some of that myself.

256
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
How many? I'll sort you out.

257
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
Call my mate, Fuzzy Rob.

258
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm gonna ask you a question.

259
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,120
Don't ask me questions.
I hate questions.

260
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,560
Do you want out?

261
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,800
Of what?

262
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,840
Of this.

263
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,800
Dream on, dreamer.
These people cut off your ears for 50p.

264
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,240
Say I can make it happen?

265
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,120
I'd have to do things that...

266
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,680
I shouldn't don't do,
but, if I'm gonna do it,

267
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
then I really, really need to know
you want this to be different.

268
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
You lying?

269
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,360
Cos, if you're lying,
I swear I'll throw up.

270
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,080
No, I'm not.

271
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,920
Is this some sort of rescue type thing?

272
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,160
Don't ask questions.

273
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,160
I don't like questions.

274
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,560
- You're just totally disco.
- Yeah, he is totally disco.

275
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,280
- So you're all right with this?
- Nobody gets hurt, right?

276
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,240
- No. Not if we do it right.
- You can't think of another way?

277
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,200
- Not in time.
- So let's disco.

278
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
What was that?

279
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,280
Oh, you're joking!
Keep an eye on him.

280
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,760
- Oi! Oi! Oi!
- Is it yours?

281
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
- Yeah, it's mine.
- I'm really sorry.

282
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,920
- How on earth have you managed this?
- Well, I was doing a three-point turn...

283
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,240
How fast were you going,

284
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,600
- for God's sake?!
- No, no, no. No speed at all.

285
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,920
A squirrel just came out
right in front of me.

286
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,560
- What you talkin' about? A squirrel!
- Honestly, it wasn't my fault.

287
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
I'm really sorry,
but it really wasn't my fault.

288
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,720
- Look at the angle you're parked at.
- How is this parked at an angle?

289
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,120
This is parallel parking!

290
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Andrei, get to a safe position.
Now! Hurry! Hurry!

291
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,640
You've been telling stories
out of school, haven't you, Andrei?

292
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Please.

293
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,680
I need you to take back whatever
you said about your friend Toby.

294
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,880
Withdraw your statement.

295
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
I can't.

296
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Look, I don't want to swap details,
all right?

297
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
- Just take this.
- Are you sure?

298
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,840
Look at me. Look at this face.
Do I look sure?

299
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,040
I found you and it took me ten minutes,
and I can find you again, just as easily.

300
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,440
Only, next time, it won't be me
who pays you a visit.

301
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,080
It'll be your friends. And I don't need
to tell you what they'll do to you, do I?

302
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,536
I think you know that.

303
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,240
Andrei, are you in there?

304
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,520
Say yes.

305
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,560
Yes.

306
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,360
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

307
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,960
I need you to open the door.

308
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,360
- I can't.
- Why not?

309
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Because I don't like women
to look at me when I'm on the lavatory!

310
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,560
- I need to come in.
- Please don't!

311
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
All right.

312
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,440
Right, just hurry up.

313
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,400
What are you - sick?

314
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,440
You like to watch men do this?

315
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,520
- Where is he?
- Erm... on the toilet.

316
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
I wish to amend my statement.

317
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,840
How do I make that happen
as soon as possible?

318
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,600
Oh, shit! Bastards!

319
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,480
There you go.

320
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,200
There.

321
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
All right.

322
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,760
Look, erm... I've gotta go.
Heavy day.

323
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Can you just drive her around
until I can confirm this has blown over?

324
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

325
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,680
You OK?

326
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
Yeah.

327
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,920
- You?
- I... I'm OK, yeah.

328
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,680
What exactly did he do?

329
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,760
I don't wanna know. Come on.

330
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,280
Ronald Bryson.

331
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,800
You sold forged documents to this man.

332
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,920
Cameron Pell.

333
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,480
Your full bespoke service, driving
licence, birth certificate, passport.

334
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,440
Education and employment records,
fake referees.

335
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,240
Everything he needed
to start life with a new identity.

336
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,960
- How are we doing?
- Boss has got his game face on.

337
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Look at him - he's got a face on
like Wayne Rooney's smacked arse.

338
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,480
- You going in, taking over?
- No.

339
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,680
I've been on the other side
of that desk with Schenk.

340
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,120
- He knows what he's doing.
- Yeah, but this is different.

341
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
A policeman is missing.

342
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Think he's still got the juice
for this sort of thing?

343
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,320
Yep.

344
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,080
I understand you like to play cards?

345
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,680
Every so often.

346
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,200
- Have much luck?
- My share.

347
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,440
Because I think I should tell you,
your poker face needs some work.

348
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,800
There's a tell.

349
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,720
There.

350
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,200
Corner of your mouth. Oops.

351
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,400
There it goes again.

352
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Did you see that, DS Gray?

353
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,080
I did, guv.

354
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,040
Couldn't miss it, really.

355
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,680
Intriguing, isn't it?
How our faces betray us.

356
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'll show you later, if you like, Ronald.

357
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,720
It's all up there...

358
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,280
on Britain's Funniest Police Videos.

359
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,840
I know men like you,
the way you know men like me.

360
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,360
And I know you wouldn't have done this

361
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,840
if you believed there was the least chance
of it coming back on you.

362
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,200
Well, guess what?

363
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,240
It's come back on you
like the hand of God!

364
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,240
And the next words from your mouth
will determine the weight and velocity

365
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,400
of the staggering tonnage of shit
that's about to plummet onto your head.

366
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,680
It weren't just bank accounts
and driving licences he was after.

367
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,720
He wanted to buy a bus.

368
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,240
What are you planning, Cameron?

369
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,040
It's too late for them to stop you now.

370
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,560
God knows I can't stop yous.

371
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,560
So...
So, please, just tell me what it is.

372
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,880
Do you really want to know?

373
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Yeah.

374
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,560
- Really?
- Yes.

375
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
OK.

376
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,200
I'm dying to talk about it.

377
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,800
Panic and you suffocate.

378
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,840
Good work, boss.

379
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,080
How did the lead pan out?

380
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
It didn't.

381
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,480
Right. We followed the money.

382
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,400
Cameron's using a contact of Bryson's

383
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,320
as a kind of one-man
front organisation and supplier.

384
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,440
We're talking one car,
one Commer-style van,

385
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,000
huge amounts of sodium hydroxide

386
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,920
and a second-hand bus.

387
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Go on.

388
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,920
He's making a bomb.

389
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Quick paint job. Stick a sign on the
front that says, "Sorry, not in service."

390
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
Drive wherever you like. Ka-boom.

391
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
No.

392
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
No?

393
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Seriously?

394
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,800
You don't think this makes sense?
We know he's planning his spectacular.

395
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,736
He's got a large vehicle,
loads of explosives...

396
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,000
No, a bomb's... loud, it's about sound.
It's about fury.

397
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,400
Cameron is the opposite of a bomb
right now.

398
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,240
He's about silence, emptiness and absence.

399
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,640
If he's not making a bomb, why does
he need 3,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide?

400
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,040
The opposite of an explosion
is an implosion.

401
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,680
Black hole.

402
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,600
- 3,000 gallons is enough...
- A black hole consumes matter

403
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,800
and crushes it beyond existence.

404
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,440
When I first heard that, I thought...
that's evil at its most pure, isn't it?

405
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,080
Something that drags you in
and crushes you to nothing.

406
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,600
Maybe he wants to use that material
to dispose...

407
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,520
dispose of bodies.

408
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,440
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

409
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,960
What do we fear the most?

410
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,680
The unknown.

411
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,600
The loss of a loved one.
Who do we love the most?

412
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,080
Who do we protect? Who do we shield
from all the evils of the world?

413
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Who do we... lie to,
leave them terrified in the dark?

414
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,120
Who do we tell that there is
no such thing as the bogeyman?

415
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,480
I think that...

416
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,600
Cameron is going after the children.

417
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,240
Ah. Ah.

418
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,240
Scheduled school bus to
Owleigh High School was vandalised.

419
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,520
Tyres were slashed.

420
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,840
- By the time the replacement bus...
- Map that. How many did he take?

421
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,400
- We don't know till we double-check.
- Guess. How many?

422
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,360
- 147
- Benny, get that on the map.

423
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,160
Boss, if I was presumptuous,
overstepped the mark, I'm really sorry.

424
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,576
Don't be. You did good work.
We wouldn't be here without you.

425
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,480
Ah, ah.

426
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,800
This is where he picks them up.

427
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,120
The bus stop, so this is his territory.
How far can he get in, what, half an hour?

428
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Argh!

429
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,440
Excuse me.

430
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,400
I need every policeman,
every armed response,

431
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,160
every helicopter,
PCSO in that area looking for that van.

432
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,680
Get on it!

433
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,240
- Hello.
- Boss.

434
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,520
- Justin.
- I'm on the corner of Wise Avenue,

435
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,080
near Chaffer's Dock.

436
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,520
Cameron's car's still here.

437
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,240
I'm on my way. I'm on my way.

438
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,480
I told you.
I told you he could look after himself.

439
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,736
He was well taught.
Gray and I will track down the bus.

440
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,640
- You get straight to Ripley.
- All right.

441
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,800
- DS Gray.
- Yes, boss!

442
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Mate!

443
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,320
- You all right?
- Yeah.

444
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,720
Boss?

445
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,400
We found the bus abandoned.
Eyewitness claims Cameron Pell

446
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
transferred the children
to a second vehicle.

447
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,720
- What other vehicle? What?
- Green VW van.

448
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,440
D reg, possibly,
although that's not been confirmed.

449
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,760
All right, all right, I'll call you back.

450
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,560
We've lost Pell and the kids.
We gotta find out where they are. Car?

451
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,320
It's this way.

452
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,800
Checking this sat nav will give us
a record of his movements.

453
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,600
He's a bogeyman, isn't he? He's a...

454
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
He's a monster,
so he does what monsters do,

455
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,800
and that's spirit children away
in the middle of broad daylight.

456
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,520
But how do you make a bus
full of kids just disappear?

457
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,320
Body disposal's not easy, is it?
One body's hard enough. But 10 or 12?

458
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,080
He needs somewhere with a lot of space.
Privacy. Come and go at will.

459
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,120
What's this? This vehicle's been
to a Green Valley Industrial Park

460
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,400
- eight times in the last month.
- That's it. Come on, that's it.

461
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,640
Suspect location believed
to be Green Valley Industrial Park.

462
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,920
It's on the old Stonewater Price dockside.

463
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,960
Come on, come on.

464
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,200
Move!

465
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:20,224
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

466
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,880
Tim, don't go out there.

467
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,560
Help!

468
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,000
Come on!

469
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
No!

470
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Don't let him see you.
Here we go!

471
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,920
Hey. Hey! Don't you move!

472
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,880
One more step and, I swear,
I will spill his guts all over the floor.

473
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,840
- What's your name?
- What?

474
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,480
- What's your name?
- You know my name.

475
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,320
I'm not talking to you.
Eh, what's your name?

476
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,840
- Eh?
- Don't you speak to him.

477
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,120
- My name's Tim.
- Hey!

478
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,280
- Are you listening to me?
- Tim.

479
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,681
- Is anybody listening to me?!
- That's my favourite name.

480
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,936
- He's not going to hurt you, Tim.
- Yes, he is.

481
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,360
- See? I'm gonna slit his little throat.
- Do you know why?

482
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,800
Why? Because I've done it before.

483
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,880
Because, if he does hurt you,
I'm free to come over there and kill him.

484
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,280
Cos he's nothing, all right?
He's nothing.

485
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,280
- He's just a weak little pathetic man.
- No, he's not.

486
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,520
- Aren't you?
- No, he's not.

487
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
- Too weak to hurt anyone...
- No, he's not!

488
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,520
Without wearing this!

489
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
Ain't that right, Cameron?

490
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,000
I swear, I swear I'm gonna do it.

491
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,840
Don't go near the van.

492
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,360
Don't you go near the van!
Don't you touch the van!

493
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
Come on.

494
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,560
Look, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna...

495
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,360
There you go. Come on. There you go.

496
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,120
Come on, eh?

497
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,360
- Let's get you out of here, eh?
- You know what I can do!

498
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,600
You know what I can do!
You know who I am!

499
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,480
Cameron. No-one's listening.

500
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,920
Uh!

501
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
You?

502
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,440
No, it's all you.

503
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,920
Cameron Pell, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

504
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,720
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

505
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,800
if you fail to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

506
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
So...

507
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,240
am1Iin trouble?

508
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,960
For what? Saving schoolchildren?
I hardly think so.

509
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,200
If I had my way, you'd be given a medal.

510
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,320
You did outstanding work.

511
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,960
So did you.

512
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,840
I like the thing about
the micro-expression.

513
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,680
Corner of the mouth.
Was that a lie?

514
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,520
Same lie I've been telling since 1986.

515
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,120
Never fails.

516
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,680
Er... Green Valley is registered
at Company House, but it's a shell.

517
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,120
Pell leased it from a contact of Bryson.

518
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,240
Boss!

519
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,160
One body per drum.
Four drums per pallet.

520
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,160
All to be shipped to India
for disposal.

521
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,560
Paperwork's already done.

522
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,400
Those children would've been wiped off
the face of the earth.

523
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,640
- Have you got stuff?
- What? Like belongings?

524
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
Yes, like belongings.

525
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,720
- Clothes and things.
- Not much, just this.

526
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,600
Er... have you got a minute?

527
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,960
Yes, of course. Come in.

528
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,520
I can't believe what you did!

529
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,760
You're my daughter. You wouldn't be
where you were if it wasn't for him.

530
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,880
- You don't understand.
- I understand I got my daughter back.

531
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,760
I'm not staying here,
not after what you did!

532
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,880
- You'll do what you're told.
- You can't make me!

533
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,080
No? And where you gonna go?
Back where you came from?

534
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,320
You've got no money.
No friends. No life.

535
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,880
- So, if not here, where? The gutter?
- Caroline... Listen.

536
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,760
- You listening? I need you to hear this.
- Go on.

537
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,600
These people don't want to hurt me.
They need me in one piece.

538
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,800
I've got nothing to leverage.
No kids. No family. No wife.

539
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,560
But they know I'll do what I have to,
cos I proved that to them today.

540
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,920
It's me, Mum.

541
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,920
If he doesn't keep on doing
what they tell him, they'll hurt me.

542
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,960
Listen to your daughter, all right?

543
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,920
Cos you put her in this situation
after you sold me out. So listen to her.

544
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,040
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Leave!

545
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,320
I've got a job. A career. A life.

546
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,240
Your safety is not my concern!
But do the right thing.

547
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,520
Give Jenny some money.
Set her up in a new city.

548
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,320
She stays here with me.

549
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,720
You won't let them hurt her.
You'll do whatever they tell you to do.

550
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,080
You made that quite plain.

551
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,680
- No.
- What?!

552
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,120
Caroline, I'm not on their hook,

553
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,520
and I'm not gonna be a copper any more.
I'm leaving.

554
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,920
And when these people find out,
they're gonna come back

555
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,440
and they're gonna hurt you both.
Do you understand that?

556
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,320
You can stop them.

557
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,240
- Arrest them.
- No, I can't.

558
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,760
- I'm over a barrel. They sent me this.
- Andrei Kolchak. One of our licensees.

559
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
- See that?
- I can't do it overnight. It needs time.

560
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,359
- You made sure of that, didn't you?
- It has to be done today.

561
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,656
- You made sure of that, didn't you?
- It has to be done today.

562
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,240
- And if I do help?
- The slate's clear.

563
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,120
Look, Jenny, you're safe here tonight.
But tomorrow, you gotta get away.

564
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,600
You've gotta get far away. And do yourself
a favour, stay away from this woman.

565
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,520
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know.

566
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,600
- Go anywhere.
- Please, don't just leave me!

567
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,680
John, I'm begging you!

568
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,640
No, sorry. I've done enough.

569
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,320
Good luck.

570
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,400
Hmm.

571
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,760
Busy day?

572
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,680
Like you wouldn't believe.

573
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
You?

574
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,960
You know what it's like.

575
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,360
Always on the go.

576
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,960
So I see you escaped.

577
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,240
Like a princess from her tower.

578
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,960
What's this?

579
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,880
It's my dad's gun.

580
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,000
You don't like guns.

581
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,880
- No, I don't.
- And there's only one bullet.

582
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,520
- What have you been playing at?
- Put it down. That's just not funny.

583
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,760
Alice...

584
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,560
you shouldn't have come here.

585
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,200
- They'll find you.
- Well, they can try.

586
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,320
But they're Wile E Coyote
and I'm the Roadrunner.

587
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,560
Meep-meep.

588
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,520
- Where will you go?
- I thought I'd start with Mexico.

589
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,840
Then there's Marrakech.

590
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,640
Monte Carlo.

591
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,640
Ah, and that's just some of the Ms.

592
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,240
There's an entire alphabet
to work through.

593
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,240
Come with me.

594
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,080
I can't.

595
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Why not?

596
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,800
Because I am who I am.

597
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,480
And you are who you are.

598
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,000
Which is exactly why I'm asking.

599
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,360
- We'd have so much fun.
- That's what I'm scared of.

600
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:37,080
Come on. Yin and Yang.
Bonnie and Clyde. Bert and Ernie.

601
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,960
Alice...

602
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,840
you have to leave.

603
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,480
OK?

604
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,800
You have to leave.

605
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,880
They'll come here, you know.

606
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,040
Why?

607
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,760
Cos they're scared you'll try to kill me.

608
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,800
Which is the funny thing, because it's
not me who'll end up killing you, is it?

609
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,360
It's them.

610
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,800
You know that.

611
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,040
You've done enough.

612
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Now give it up...

613
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,920
and walk away.

614
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,120
Come with me.

615
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,840
I know you want to.
You've got a telltale heart.

616
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
We can swim with the sharks.

617
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,400
See the Nazca Lines.

618
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,960
Have you ever eaten fugu
made from puffer fish?

619
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,440
It's fatal if prepared incorrectly
and, er...

620
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,240
delicious, naturally.

621
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,040
I just can't.

622
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,440
Who is she?

623
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,960
- It's not like that.
- I know.

624
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,680
If it were, I may be able to understand.

625
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,640
You do understand.
That's the thing about you.

626
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,720
Just because I understand,
it doesn't mean I approve.

627
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,040
- It works both ways, doesn't it?
- Doesn't it just?

628
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,000
And didn't it always?

629
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,880
Come on.

630
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,080
Come on.

631
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,480
John!

632
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,680
All right, then. Erm...

633
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,240
Living room. Kitchen, bathroom.

634
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,440
My room.

635
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,040
Your room.

636
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,480
Um, tomorrow, I'll get you a bed,
but tonight, you're on the sofa.

637
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,760
Erm, just make yourself at home,
you know, you can, er, put the kettle on.

638
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,960
- Want one?
- Tea.

639
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,280
This kettle's minging.

640
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,080
It's got miningitus.
D'you get it from a market?

641
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,160
You can get righteous kettles these days,
all chrome and whatnot.

642
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,080
Where's he keep the mugs?

643
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,680
