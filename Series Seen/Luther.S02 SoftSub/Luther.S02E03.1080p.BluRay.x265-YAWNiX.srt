1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,760
Luther. Is he really as dirty as they say?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,080
What, all the people
who've never worked with him?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,400
Did you ever hear of necro-porn?

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,000
This is what they're going to do
to Jenny. You owe me.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,560
- I am arresting you...
- Get off me!

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,440
If he doesn't keep on doing
what they tell him, they'll hurt me.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,080
I gather you're the policeman
that stole my property.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,880
This is Toby.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,520
No! No! Agh!

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,200
Where am I supposed to go?

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,240
Pump number two, that's £64.19, please.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,080
- Can I interest you in one...?
- Just the petrol, ta.

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,200
What's he doing?

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,160
He's on something. Look at him.

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,040
You might want to give
the police a call, mate.

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,600
What's he doing exactly?

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
Dunno.

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,600
Look, just dial 999.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,560
And say what?
"Hello, I'm calling from a petrol station,

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,240
"there's a man on the forecourt
looking at cars"?

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,600
Just do it, mate.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,880
What's he doing?

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,880
- That's my car! Hey! Oi!
- Police, please.

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,120
- They're on their way. Five minutes.
- What's he on, do you think?

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,880
Excuse me, did we lock the door?
Because I think we should lock the door!

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's a very good idea.

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,296
- Hey!
- Lock the door! Hurry up! Lock the door!

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm trying!

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,880
- Let me out! Hey! Hey! That's my car!
- The police will be here in a minute!

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,480
But look at my car! Look at my car!

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,200
- Unlock this door!
- The police will be here in a minute.

32
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
But look at my car!

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,920
Oh, no, mate.

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,376
- Is he opening...?
- I'm not letting him do that.

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,360
- I'm not.
- No, wait! Nobody leaves.

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,496
He's going to torch the car.

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,696
- Just wait for the police.
- He's going to torch the car!

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Right, open the door. Just do as he says
and open the bloody door!

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,200
- Be careful.
- Oi! Hey! Hey! You stop!

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,760
Ah! Agh! Christ! My eyes!

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,760
- Put down the bat. Put down the bat.
- Argh!

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
Fire bucket! Fire bucket!

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,280
Have you locked the door? Quick! Quick!

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,880
Take the keys. Lock it.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,560
- Brace it! Brace it!
- I'm trying!

46
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,160
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

47
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,480
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

48
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,080
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

49
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,640
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you. ♪

50
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Wakey, wakey!

51
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,800
Come on, wake up. The day's half over.

52
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,520
But it's nothing o'clock.

53
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you hungry?

54
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Do you like reading books?

55
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm partial to a graphic novel.

56
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,040
Comics? How old are you?

57
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
Graphic novels. How old are you?

58
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
You look normal.

59
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Ta.

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,560
You look weird when you look normal.

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,640
You think I sleep in a tie?

62
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Hmm, pretty much.

63
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
Except you don't so much sleep
as, you know,

64
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,600
power down, go into stand-by mode.

65
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,320
Yeah, well...

66
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
I took the day off.

67
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,040
Why?

68
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,960
Cos we've got to think
about getting you... a job.

69
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,720
What sort of job?

70
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,680
- A job job.
- Like flipping burgers?

71
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,720
Well, them burgers are not going
to flip themselves, are they?

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,720
It's, like, 2p an hour.
Who am I, SpongeBob?

73
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,600
- I don't know what that is.
- He's a sponge. He flips burgers.

74
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,800
Right. Well, why don't we keep
flipping burgers to plan B?

75
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,616
If you could do any job in the world,
what would you do?

76
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,600
- I'd be a cool hunter.
- A what?

77
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,760
Cool hunter. Go to seriously
sick places, clubs, whatever.

78
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Underground, not mainstream.

79
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,056
You kind of take note of what people
are wearing, what slang they're using,

80
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
what they're drinking, that sort of thing.

81
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,200
It's a lot more complicated
than it sounds.

82
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Cup of tea.

83
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,160
Totally lushalicious.

84
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,440
So...

85
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,520
what are you going to do
about the other thing?

86
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,040
Being on the hook and that?

87
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Is that what I am? On the hook?

88
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,920
Well, yeah.

89
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,480
Toby won't just let us go, you know.

90
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,480
I'll think of something.

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Morning.

92
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,520
- All right?
- Your phone was off.

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,280
Right. Well, keep the phone on,
all it does is ring.

94
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,880
Yeah. Sorry. The boss sent me.
We've got a really weird one.

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
Um, OK. All right, um, just wait
in the car and I'll get changed.

96
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,280
- Why wait in the car?
- Two minutes.

97
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Two minutes.

98
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,560
I've got to go to work.

99
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,360
So, you, whatever you do today,
make sure you hit the Jobcentre, right?

100
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,680
Hand.

101
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
- What?
- Hand, please.

102
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,520
Completely bomb dot com.

103
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Now, you want to keep it clean and dry
and clear of infection.

104
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,600
All right, Mum.

105
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,400
So the stolen car belonged
to the dead man, Adewale Omotoso.

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,480
Jesus.

107
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,800
White van belongs to a Steven Kimble.

108
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
- Is that the man that was blinded?
- Yeah, that's him.

109
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,480
Acid in a water pistol.
Probably hydrochloric.

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,000
Witnesses?

111
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,320
Sally Thomas and Depak Chandrapal,
who locked themselves inside the shop.

112
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Thing is, both claim that they reckon

113
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
the attacker intended to ram the window
but changed his mind last minute

114
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,840
- and drove away.
- We know why?

115
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,256
Dunno. Uniform were dealing
with an altercation outside a pub

116
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,000
called the Prince Regent,
which is about half a mile up there.

117
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,800
So they were Johnny-on-the-spot.

118
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,680
They were here two minutes
after the 999 call came in,

119
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,320
so maybe he's heard the sirens
and, you know, just ran away.

120
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Maybe.

121
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,200
So, er, timeline. He gets here.
What's the first thing he does?

122
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,400
Graffities the Corolla.

123
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,600
- Corolla? Where?
- On the roof.

124
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
- Have you done here, SOCO?
- Yeah.

125
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
A compass, maybe?

126
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Run it by intel,
see if there's any gang association.

127
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,000
I was thinking - four people,

128
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,040
two black, including the dead man,
one white, one Asian.

129
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,000
You think it was racial?

130
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,640
Well, Nazis do love an insignia.

131
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,520
But Kimble's white.

132
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,440
He got in the way.

133
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah. Well, look into it.

134
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
See if there's any, er...

135
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,200
white-power faction...
affiliated with that.

136
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Hold it there.

137
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,760
What's he doing?

138
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,560
- Is he tying a shoelace or something?
- Could be. Or reading a text?

139
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,360
What, kneeling down?

140
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,960
Is that a thing?

141
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,440
Could be getting something
out of his sock?

142
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,080
- What could Benny do with that?
- Probably not much.

143
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,600
- Resolution's pretty low.
- Let me see the rest.

144
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,800
I tell you what,
if they hadn't have stopped him,

145
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,440
he would have blown
this whole place to the moon.

146
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,280
Hang on, they've found the car.

147
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,760
All right...

148
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,520
- what've we got?
- Not much.

149
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,920
He's torched it, obviously, and that's it.

150
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,480
Listen, this is taken from CCTV
at the garage. Get on to uniform,

151
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,040
get them to canvass the area, see if

152
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,360
- we can't put a name to that face.
- Right, will do.

153
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,400
- Is everything all right, guv?
- Er... yeah. Yeah.

154
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,080
So you handle door-to-door.

155
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,360
Justin... get on to intel,
see if they can ID that compass.

156
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,160
I'll meet you at the factory, all right?
I've got a meeting.

157
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,560
- You all right?
- Yeah, great.

158
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,360
It's just... you know.

159
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,480
Just what?

160
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
I just...

161
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,200
want to do it right, you know?

162
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
Listen, if he asks you to do something
and you're not sure,

163
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,320
don't butt heads with him. OK?
Just, well, come and see me.

164
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,160
Right. Better get canvassing.
Nazis, nutters, jugglers and the clowns.

165
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,520
I like this bit. Watch.

166
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,320
- All right, show's over!
- Wait for it...

167
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
There!

168
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
I am arresting you...

169
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,840
It's brilliant!

170
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,120
Oh, and it never gets old. Honestly.

171
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,520
Yeah, and I hear that, um...

172
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,920
she's living with you now.

173
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,320
How is... How's that working out?

174
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,160
Let's not talk about Jenny, eh?

175
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,920
Good for you. You can't beat
a nice warm mouth to come home to.

176
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,440
She did live with another man for a while.

177
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,640
And he was a depraved
old monster, really.

178
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,560
I think she liked it, in a way.

179
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,720
Being his dirty little servant.

180
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,280
Daddy issues.

181
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
- Do you know why she left him?
- Thing is, I don't care.

182
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,000
He asked how much it would cost
to buy her outright,

183
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,840
thereafter to do as his will dictated,
one presumes.

184
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,880
I've still got his number somewhere.

185
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,320
Michael Saroyan. Armenian imports.

186
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,240
Making aggressive moves
in the local market.

187
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,120
He's merging smaller operations -

188
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,440
clubs, trafficking, girls, protection,
all the rest of it.

189
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,000
Another job for you -

190
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,016
I'd like to know the extent
of his market penetration.

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,640
Your turf wars are your business.

192
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,440
If that sort of thing ever got traced back

193
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,040
- to me...
- Make sure it's not.

194
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,080
A list of his capital assets.

195
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,680
I'd tread carefully
with that sort of thing.

196
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,760
No, you'll tread exactly
where and how I tell you.

197
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,800
A list of Saroyan's personnel today.
Are we clear?

198
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,920
What, do I have to ask more politely?

199
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sick of this. Just do as you're told.

200
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,680
John.

201
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,000
I need what I asked for... today.

202
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,000
Or we'll pop round, pay Jenny a visit.

203
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,440
Yeah, open her up. See what's inside.

204
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,400
Look at yourself, Frank.

205
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,480
- What?
- You know what.

206
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,640
No, I don't know what. What?
Tell me what.

207
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,640
You don't think I can do it, do you?
You actually don't think I'm capable

208
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,200
of squeezing a couple of addresses
out of a dirty copper.

209
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,880
He's not a dirty copper.

210
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,840
He's a man over a barrel.

211
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,640
That's a completely different thing, and
you handle it a completely different way.

212
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,520
What have we got, Gray?

213
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,840
Um, there are one or two
white-power psychos in the estate,

214
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,160
namely one Ryan Hayfield.

215
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,560
And do we like him?

216
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,480
Well, he's unemployed,
long history of mental illness,

217
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,880
interest in various
right-of-right-wing groups.

218
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,680
Lives with his mum, always a good sign
in @ man of 35. And that's him.

219
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,320
Nah. Definitely not.

220
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,640
Eliminate him. What have you got?

221
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,680
I checked the compass design
against local gang insignia -

222
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,600
A-Road, Mothers' Square Boys,
Gravehouse Boys, Hindle Street Gangs...

223
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
- Any joy?
- Completely joyless.

224
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,480
Yeah. It never felt like tagging to me.

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,640
Why put it on a roof,

226
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,016
- where no-one can see it?
- I don't think it's a compass.

227
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Oh, yeah?

228
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,080
See, in my spare time,
I like to read a lot of fantasy fiction.

229
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,000
And I think it's the Bedlam Axis.

230
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,320
What's a Bedlam Axis when it's at home?

231
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
Yeah. Bedlam Axis has been around
since the 1960s.

232
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,920
It's used a lot in RPG -
role-playing games.

233
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,040
So, the arrow going upwards indicates
predictability, law and order.

234
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,600
The arrow going across
indicates unpredictably.

235
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,040
Chaos.

236
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,320
Can we see that CCTV footage
of him kneeling down?

237
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,680
Yeah, I...

238
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,960
I don't think he's tying up his shoelace.

239
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,600
You know, I tie my shoelace like this.

240
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
I don't think he's texting either.

241
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,280
I think he's making his decisions
on a roll of a dice.

242
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,480
Who to kill, when to kill,
whether or not to kill.

243
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,360
Have you come across
anything like this ever before?

244
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,920
No. You?

245
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,480
No.

246
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Judging by his demeanour last night,
the man was enjoying himself immensely.

247
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,400
So what are the chances
of there being more to come?

248
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,800
Think of this as a spree
that's only just started.

249
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,280
Yeah, well, that may be true,
but one crime does not a pattern make.

250
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,520
We don't know which aspects of it
he may choose to repeat.

251
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
If any.

252
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,480
I mean, if he's doing all this
at the roll of a dice,

253
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,919
his next kill could be any time,
anywhere, any place.

254
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,000
His next kill could be any time,
anywhere, any place.

255
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,120
- So, how do we catch him?
- Well, we get lucky.

256
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,560
Or he gets unlucky.

257
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,280
Or a combination of the two.

258
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,440
Listen to me, Toby. Yeah. Listen, listen.

259
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,960
I know you want to be a big boy
and impress Frank, all right,

260
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,560
but you need to calm down.
You'll get it when I get it.

261
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,720
- No, no. Today.
- I can't.

262
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,600
Yes. Yes, you can. You'll do it now.

263
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,760
Listen, if that stuff isn't in my hands
in the next two hours,

264
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,680
do I have to tell you what'll happen?

265
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
Unless you want me
to dismember your whore.

266
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,800
So just do as you're told.

267
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
- Who's fire picket?
- Guy, that's me.

268
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,840
- Well, clear the floor, then, please.
- OK, everyone.

269
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,040
You know the drill. Let's
all meet at the assembly point, please!

270
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,200
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Quick as you can.

271
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Hello?

272
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,480
Password...?

273
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,040
All right?

274
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,960
OK, everyone. We need to do
a quick head count. Sorry about this.

275
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,920
Right, let's go.

276
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Tossers.

277
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,480
Yo, John Luther, it's me.

278
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,200
So I went to the Jobcentre, and they
weren't amazingly pleasant to me.

279
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,720
Turns out there's been
this global downturn, whatever.

280
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,360
So it's... all quiet on the job front.

281
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,440
Hello, Mum?

282
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,760
You fancy meeting up
for coffee or something?

283
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,520
Right, it's our man.

284
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
Definitely our man.
We just don't know who he is,

285
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,440
and we can't tell
what he's going to do next, so...

286
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,560
- We've got to know where he's at.
- How do we do that?

287
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,200
I say we get CO19 ready,
monitor the emergency lines.

288
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
If we hear anything that sounds unusual,
we think it's him,

289
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,400
we send in armed response.

290
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
See if we can't catch him in the act.

291
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,080
London's got, what,
six thousand 999 calls a day?

292
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,320
Yeah, but 70% of them
are time-wasters, cats up trees.

293
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,336
Most of the rest is meat and potatoes.
It shouldn't be

294
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,840
- too hard to set up a filter.
- Right.

295
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,280
If we think it's him,
we make a judgment call.

296
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,000
We go in loud and heavy.

297
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,520
What do you think of that plan?

298
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,080
- Let's do it.
- Sounds good.

299
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,000
- Police emergency.
- Threatening to kill herself...

300
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,840
Covered in blood.
I don't know what to do...

301
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,520
Just running around
with blood all over his face...

302
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,360
- I dunno, a knife or something.
- My son, he's schizophrenic.

303
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
He's off his medication...

304
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,120
Oh, yeah, I'm not being funny, but there's
this really mean dog running around.

305
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,320
I know it sounds a bit...

306
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,800
But I'm just worried
it's going to bite a baby or something.

307
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
A woman's just been mugged.
Yeah. An old lady.

308
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Two blokes came up to her and just, bang,
they just ran off with her bag.

309
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
An inmate. I'm all covered in blood.
I don't know what to do.

310
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,680
Sir. OK, boys and girls,
we've got ourselves a weird one.

311
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Here we go.

312
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,600
- Benny, what you got for me?
- Random attack. Three people stabbed.

313
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,880
Killer has stolen
a motorcycle courier's bike,

314
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,560
bag, helmet and jacket.

315
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,760
He left the scene three minutes ago
on the bike, dressed as a courier.

316
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,200
All right. Here's the plan.
Contact that courier's delivery company,

317
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,320
find out what his next scheduled
delivery is, scramble ARV,

318
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,776
see if we can't get there before he does.

319
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,520
That's him. That's him.

320
00:32:37,544 --> 00:32:39,544
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

321
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,720
Susie! Susie! Come on!

322
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,960
- How many?
- Four confirmed dead.

323
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,880
Many injured.

324
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,960
We missed him by... minutes.

325
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,000
We don't have him and we don't know
where he's going to go next.

326
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,160
He'd have dumped
the courier rig and moved on.

327
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,080
Escape route?

328
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,160
Through the car park.

329
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,600
Boss, what's up?

330
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
Justin, he's still in the building!

331
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,040
Dressed as an employee.

332
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,680
OK. Erin.

333
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,560
He's still here.
Make sure no-one else leaves.

334
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,800
OK.

335
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,880
Put the phone down.

336
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,760
This is John Luther. Leave a message.

337
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,320
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on...

338
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,120
All right, Mum?

339
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
All right, Mum?

340
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Coffee shop closed?

341
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,400
So are you sleeping with him?

342
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,920
"Hello, Jen! How are you?

343
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,600
"Can I tell you, you look utterly mint?"

344
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,640
- Are you?
- Utterly mint? Totally.

345
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,560
Sleeping with him?

346
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,840
Whatever. He's, like, 55.

347
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,080
So how are you paying the rent?

348
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,080
He doesn't want rent, actually.

349
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,280
I bet he doesn't.

350
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,080
If you knew how that man
tortured your dad.

351
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
- Because you loved Dad so much, right?!
- Yes.

352
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,560
I did.

353
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,920
So you didn't try to screw John
the minute Dad was cold in the ground?

354
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,440
- Is that what he told you?
- That's what I saw.

355
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,360
- What you think you saw.
- Mum... I saw.

356
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,240
- Just come home. Please.
- No.

357
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,720
- I just want us to be...
- What?

358
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,440
"Hello, world! Hello, neighbours!
Here we are!

359
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,960
"Jenny and Caroline! We're normal!
Look how normal we are!"

360
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,960
- You really are one evil little bitch.
- Yeah, well...

361
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,440
the apple didn't fall
far from the tree.

362
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
What?

363
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,080
Are you going to start smacking me about
a bit now?

364
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,880
Do you know what?

365
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,520
Go ahead.

366
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,200
I've been hit by animals
a lot meaner than you.

367
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Take it.

368
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,240
Keep it.

369
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,520
Just take it. For food. For rent.

370
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't want your money.

371
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm getting a job.

372
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,200
Have you got one yet?

373
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Not yet, no.

374
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,720
- Then take it.
- I don't want your money.

375
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,840
But if I was a strange man with
an erection and a video camera,

376
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,880
then you'd take it, wouldn't you?

377
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,640
Erin, what's up?

378
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
You said I could come to you.

379
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,320
Yeah, absolutely.

380
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,800
I don't know what to do, Justin.

381
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,240
- What about?
- Luther.

382
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,440
Today, during the fire alarm,
he breaks into Schenk's office,

383
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,080
accesses his computer.

384
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,400
And don't say it, because I'm sure.
I wish I wasn't, but I am.

385
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,800
He's got no need to.

386
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,560
Access to the database is audited.

387
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,360
I mean, why else use Schenk's computer?

388
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Whatever he was doing, he didn't want
anyone else to know he was doing it.

389
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,840
Tell me that's not dirty.

390
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,360
OK, yeah, on the face of it, it looks odd.

391
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,320
But there'll be a reason.

392
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,080
Oh, come on

393
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,960
There's loyalty and then there's...
naivety.

394
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,480
There's also a difference

395
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,720
between getting your hands dirty
and being dirty.

396
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,920
This is what I get, is it?

397
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,320
I've come to you for help.
And this is it?

398
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,880
Platitudes and denials and puppy-dog eyes?

399
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,080
Right. Just leave it with me.

400
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,920
- Right?
- Thank you.

401
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,720
I'm DCI John Luther.

402
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,680
Question is, who are you?

403
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,640
Your fingerprints
didn't show up on the records.

404
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,560
You're not carrying any ID.

405
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,840
Just this.

406
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
And these.

407
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
What?

408
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,040
Well, I've been using our quiet time...

409
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,920
to think about this.

410
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,640
What is it?

411
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,160
What could it be?

412
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,800
Do you know what I think?

413
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,040
I reckon it's a scorecard.

414
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,560
How many points, what, ten points
for killing someone with a baseball bat?

415
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,000
20 points for, I don't know,

416
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,880
stabbing a stranger to death. Am I right?

417
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
Is that what this is?

418
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,240
Who were you trying to call...

419
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,480
at the office? Who was that?

420
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,080
The wife?

421
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,080
Girlfriend, boyfriend?

422
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,640
Boyfriend.

423
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,240
I didn't think it was your mum and dad.

424
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,400
No, we checked the records,
and it was a disposable phone.

425
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,720
The only time
that number has been called,

426
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,640
so doesn't say Mum and Dad to me.

427
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
Does that say Mum and Dad to you?

428
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,440
So who was it?

429
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,480
Who was it?

430
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,400
Who was it?

431
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,520
You know, I've been a police officer
since God was a boy.

432
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,240
I don't think I've sat
across a table from someone

433
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,840
who takes their right to silence
so seriously.

434
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
Want to say something?

435
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,120
No?

436
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,640
Who are you?

437
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,040
We'll find out, won't we?

438
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,360
John?

439
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,080
Oh!

440
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,800
- Agh!
- Hello.

441
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,720
You remember me?

442
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,920
Of course you do.

443
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,120
And what an evening that was!

444
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,680
Well, I do apologise for any
work-related injuries that you sustained.

445
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,280
Where is he?

446
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,760
- The man of the house.
- Working.

447
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,440
Bringing home the bacon, as it were.

448
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,440
When will he be back?

449
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,000
Whenever he can.

450
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,776
- And when's that?
- Do I look like his wife?

451
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,520
Darling, you don't look like
anybody's wife.

452
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,480
So, anyway, door's that way.

453
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,600
No, er, I can't leave.

454
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,040
Not before the Big Bad John shows up...

455
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,040
and gives me what I'm waiting for.

456
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,680
You know, I really must say,
he's being disappointingly tardy.

457
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,120
Yeah, definitely more dial-up
than broadband.

458
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,440
So you'd better be off, then.

459
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,080
Did I hurt you that badly?

460
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,080
I...

461
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,680
I can't help it.

462
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,000
It's the screams.

463
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,680
See?

464
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,000
I think they're rather like watches.

465
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,640
On one level...

466
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
the fake ones are convincing enough...

467
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,201
the fake ones are convincing enough...

468
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,680
until you've tried the genuine article.

469
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,800
What's that?

470
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,080
- It's not yours!
- Ooh.

471
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,640
Ooh.

472
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,760
David Bowie.

473
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,560
Oh, my God. That is so sweet.

474
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,440
You do know you're ill?

475
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,360
There's something wrong with you.

476
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,240
Yeah, apparently, there is.

477
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,080
When I was eight, they caught me...

478
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,040
interfering with
the corpse of a cat, and, er...

479
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,720
told them it was
a scientific experiment.

480
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,280
I was just trying to see
if there were any kittens inside.

481
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,360
There were no kittens.

482
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,600
How are you on the money front?

483
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,720
- Don't you start.
- Cos I've got the money

484
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,000
if you've got the time.

485
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,800
- I don't do that any more.
- Oh, what, cos you've found yourself?

486
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,760
Is it cos you've found some kind of

487
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,160
pure core of strength and self-respect,
or is it because

488
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,000
you're learning to love yourself
as a woman?

489
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,280
You need to leave. If John comes back
and hears you talking to me like this...

490
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,080
"Talking to me like this"?
I think John will do as he's told.

491
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,680
I could have you bent over this table

492
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,520
and there'd be nothing he could do
but stand back and watch.

493
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,480
Besides which, John's not here, is he?

494
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,960
Hmm?

495
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,320
I told him what I wanted.

496
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,600
I told him what I'd do.

497
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,200
But John's not here. He's not here
for you, he's not here for me.

498
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,400
I think he's let the both of us down.

499
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,280
I'll, er, be very gentle.

500
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,640
Or not.

501
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,320
- Get out.
- Come on.

502
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,880
- Get out!
- What is it?

503
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,240
Has he got a thing for sullied goods?
Is that what it is?

504
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,056
- Don't talk about him.
- Or does he like to be the hero?

505
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,760
Putting pretty young things
into his bed for gratitude?

506
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,280
Eh, what does he like? What's his scene?
What does he like? Hey?

507
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,440
- Don't, please!
- Does he like this?

508
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,600
Does he like this?

509
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,440
Boss, have you got a minute?

510
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,520
Yeah. Walk... Walk out with me.

511
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,240
Everything all right?

512
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,600
Um, with me, yeah.

513
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,640
What does that mean?

514
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,880
Um...

515
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,000
Were you in Schenk's office?

516
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,880
- When?
- Today, during the fire alarm.

517
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,240
Who's told you that?

518
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,160
No-one. It doesn't matter.

519
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,560
Were you, though?

520
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,400
- Justin, do you trust me?
- Yeah. You know I do.

521
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,920
All right, well, don't say
what you're about to say.

522
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,520
Are you in trouble?

523
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,680
Things are a little messy.

524
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
But I'm working it out.

525
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,800
Toby, I've got it
and I'm ready to meet you,

526
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,840
so just call me and tell me where.

527
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,840
Jenny?

528
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,520
Jenny, where are you?

529
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,000
Are you home?

530
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,400
Where are you?

531
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,920
I'm sorry.

532
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,720
I'm really, really sorry.
