1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,045
Hey, Jim, Stanley's back
from the hospital today.

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,547
Can you sign his card?
Oh, great.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,760
"Glad they didn't mix up your
tonsillectomy with a mustachectomy."

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,680
That's not good.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,057
Oh, because your jokes
are all hilarious.

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,434
It's nice.
It's funny.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,935
It mentions his
tonsillectomy and makes

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,437
a funny little joke
about his mustache.

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,105
Stanley doesn't
have a mustache.

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,442
Yeah, he does.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,820
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley
does not have a mustache.

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:35,452
I misspoke, I'm not sure. I think he
has one... I think he has a mustache.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,537
Okay, Phyllis sits
across from him every day.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,955
Phyllis, does he
have a mustache or not?

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,625
Oh, I don't know.
Now I think he doesn't.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,752
Phyllis,
what are you talking...

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,795
The whole card
depends on this.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,505
Okay, the man's
worked here for 25 years.

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,299
How can none of us
picture his face?

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,884
Because we come
here to do our jobs.

21
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,136
We don't stick our noses
in other people's business.

22
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,389
Okay. Which one of these
looks more right?

23
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,766
Neither of those
looks like any person

24
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,392
that has ever
existed or been dreamt of

25
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,019
in the history
of human insanity.

26
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,604
That said,
the one on the left.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,733
Guys, that's the elevator.
What if it's him?

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,985
Okay, quick,
who says "mustache"?

29
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,112
Yep.

30
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,156
Who says "no mustache"?

31
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,748
Ah!

32
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey!
He does have one.

33
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,085
Yes!

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,046
Welcome back, Stanley.

35
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,517
"Good morning, Robert,"
says no one

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,061
because our receptionist
is in Florida.

37
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,611
Pam!
Oh!

38
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:56,950
Is this a video conference you're
having with "Drake featuring Swizz Beatz"?

39
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,703
Um, no, I was just
having a cup of coffee,

40
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,996
kind of warming up
for the day.

41
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,832
People, you should come
to work already warm.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,670
9:00 to 10:00 a.m. is the most
productive potential that human beings...

43
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,964
Sorry! Sorry,
everyone, I'm late,

44
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,801
but you are all here, so no
harm done at all by my lateness.

45
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,053
Nellie, really, 9:50.

46
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,306
Oh, here's
what happened.

47
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,643
7:46, my alarm clock goes
off, I hear it, whack the snooze.

48
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,148
Nine minutes. Buzz,
off it goes again, whack.

49
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,610
Seven more times I did that.
Buzz, whack, buzz, whack.

50
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,613
By the time I got up,
it was 10 minutes ago.

51
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,241
No will power.
That is my curse.

52
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,494
I've never believed will power
was very important in a woman.

53
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,541
I don't think you would
have shown up to work

54
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,752
nearly an hour late
for no reason.

55
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,628
Oh, I assure you
I would have done.

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,922
I did. And I'll keep doing it.

57
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,301
No, no, there's something
going on, some stress in your life.

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,474
Well, yes, there is the whole
moving to Scranton nonsense.

59
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:07,479
Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from
England and two trunks from Florida.

60
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,689
Then, I have to
move into my apartment

61
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,942
in this dreadful,
God knows where it is,

62
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,070
backwater,
suburb of a suburb,

63
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,738
and I mean, no
offense, but are there

64
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,199
a lot of Irish people
living around here?

65
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,784
- Yes.
- Oh!

66
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,244
I hate that.
No offense.

67
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,537
None taken.

68
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,290
Actually, Nellie, this monologue
you're delivering is very offensive.

69
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,960
Ooh! Ay carambal! The
natives are getting restless.

70
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,587
Who's a native?

71
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,465
Excuse me, the tone
here is getting quite hostile.

72
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,550
I would appreciate it if
you would keep that stuff

73
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,135
on the basketball court.

74
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,970
What does that mean?
Okay, okay.

75
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,848
If you'd let me finish.

76
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,353
Or the squash court or
the supreme court. Hmm?

77
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,481
Nellie?
Yes, Robert.

78
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:56,361
You're clearly under a lot
of stress with the moving

79
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,156
and the work situation
you've found yourself in.

80
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,282
Yeah.

81
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,951
Let's help her out,
shall we?

82
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,745
Go above and beyond today

83
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,290
to show her some of that
warm Scranton hospitality.

84
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,169
Jim, Dwight, take the day.

85
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,006
Help Nellie move those
boxes into her new place.

86
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,508
Why Jim?
What?

87
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,429
The rest of you, let's throw
a party at the end of the day

88
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,432
to welcome the newest
member of our little community.

89
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,726
I'm sorry, we're throwing
a party for someone

90
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,186
because they're
being horrible?

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,147
I'm sorry.
We're taking work time

92
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,441
to move someone's personal
belongings into their new apartment.

93
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,317
I'm still not sure why
this woman is even here!

94
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,694
Why is she here?

95
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,031
Two crazy
kids on the journey of life

96
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,076
Going to Pennsylvania

97
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,662
On the road with
my new girlfriend.

98
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,125
But first, a small pit stop to
break up with my current girlfriend,

99
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,295
who is at her parents' cabin
in southern Pennsylvania.

100
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,629
Oh, that must be nice.

101
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,797
Mmm-hmm.

102
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,551
It's a beautiful place. Great
place to let her down easy.

103
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,387
Oh, no, no, I meant that
must be nice to have parents.

104
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,555
Oh. Hmm.

105
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,434
Time to have a little kiss

106
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,643
No.

107
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,312
Mmm. Sorry, right.

108
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,022
No kisses until the
breakup is official. Yes.

109
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,315
I believe in that.
Yes, so do I

110
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,568
I think that's important. That is
important. Bummer, but important.

111
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,069
Important.
Mmm-hmm.

112
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,822
I can't believe he's making
us throw a party for her.

113
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:23,990
I know. Right?

114
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,408
She's always late,
she's always rude.

115
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,619
It Kind of makes me want
to throw a really bad party.

116
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,703
Yeah.

117
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,871
On purpose.

118
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,873
Phyllis.

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,210
We should do it right
here in the break room.

120
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,628
Ooh!

121
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,505
Order carrot cake.

122
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,384
And Jessica,
just so you know,

123
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,971
this is way more about my love for
Erin than anything wrong with you.

124
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,059
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you
did this in the best way possible,

125
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:56,481
and I knew you as a lover and
I'll remember you as a gentleman.

126
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,900
Okay. That was one
minute and 10 seconds.

127
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,610
Consider it nailed.

128
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,738
I think we
should try it again.

129
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,323
This time,
worst case scenario.

130
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,244
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm
really sorry. I just need you to know...

131
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,954
What?

132
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,705
I just need
you to know...

133
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,791
What? I didn't
sleep well last night.

134
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,923
Ow!

135
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,634
Nellie, that reminds me, do you
want this chair in the bedroom?

136
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,302
"Cause I don't think it's
going to fit through the door.

137
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,972
Don't listen to Jim. Have
you ever seen him play Tetris?

138
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,724
"Oh, I think I'll just
use this line horizontally.

139
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,435
"Oh, I have no idea
what a gift this line is."

140
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,603
That was one time.

141
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,815
I will get the chair in. Watch the
great "Schrut-ini" work his magic.

142
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,569
Oh, no, really? Magic, no,
no, no, let's not go there.

143
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,948
No, nothing is more
repellent than magicians.

144
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,367
Bunch of grown men,
waving wands,

145
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,452
pulling bunnies
out of body crevices.

146
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,746
Magicians are repulsive.
Next topic.

147
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,999
Excuse me, one second.

148
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,752
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

149
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,088
Oh, nothing, just hauling
some cube with Dwight.

150
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,673
Hauling cube!

151
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,841
That's moving boxes.

152
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,884
We just came up with the
term to make it sound cooler.

153
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,678
So, we're planning
this party for Nellie,

154
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,389
and we're going to
make it really bad.

155
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,515
It sounds like
every other party.

156
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,767
No, we're going to
make it like a prank,

157
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,854
like order bad food, give her
this passive-aggressive card.

158
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,939
Oh, hire a magician.

159
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,107
What?

160
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,151
Trust me.
Okay.

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,329
Wow, there's a lot of cars
here. This is just weird.

162
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,709
Andy. Hi, what
are you doing here?

163
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,461
Hey, Lauren,
look at you.

164
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,212
I know, look at me.

165
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,214
I'm just on my way back
from this business trip,

166
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,883
thought I'd stop
and say hi to Jessica.

167
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,051
Aw!

168
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,803
Why is Erin with me?
That's a great question.

169
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,558
She is my co-worker and she needed
a ride, because she totaled her car.

170
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,143
Oh, God.

171
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,520
So I'm Erin.
Yeah, this is Erin.

172
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,855
Hi. Nice to meet you.

173
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,444
Well, Jess went out for a run,
but she'll be back soon.

174
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,528
Mmm-hmm.

175
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,906
Hey, ladies,
Andy's here.

176
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,202
Okay, Andy, that is
a bachelorette party.

177
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,830
This is Jessica's friends, and they've
been drinking during the daytime.

178
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
Should we go?

179
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,041
Yeah.

180
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,543
You know, we had such a
quick window to make this work.

181
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,670
I think we should
probably just...

182
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,840
Oh, Jess, look who stopped
by after his business trip.

183
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,467
Andy, hey.

184
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,972
I wonder if king-sized sheets are
called presidential-sized in England.

185
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,642
I really should have
a "Tweeter" account.

186
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,852
Yes, you should.

187
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,772
Ooh!

188
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,777
I have to see
these shoes.

189
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,028
I doubt that they're...

190
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,531
Oh.

191
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,742
Who is this guy?

192
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,037
There's the two of them
taking a hike.

193
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,914
I'm guessing he's
some kind of friend.

194
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,666
Boyfriend.

195
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,710
Here's the two of them
kissing at a beach

196
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,170
and kissing at
the Eiffel Tower.

197
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,631
I'm guessing he's some
kind of close, romantic friend.

198
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,091
Like a boyfriend?

199
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,552
You read my mind.
Yeah.

200
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,930
Whoa. Here's one with
his face whited out.

201
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,056
Hmm.

202
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,266
Maybe someone threw
a pie in his face.

203
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,601
New theory, he's a
hated Italian politician.

204
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,270
Better theory,
this is her ex-boyfriend,

205
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,855
and they went through
some kind of painful breakup.

206
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
Nellie,
Oh.

207
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,735
SO sorry,
we were just...

208
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,320
I see you've
discovered Benjamin.

209
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,406
That's what I call my
box full of photos of Henry.

210
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,492
Why not call...
Shh.

211
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,415
God, we owned
this flat together.

212
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,168
Then one morning, just
like that, he was gone.

213
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,086
He ran off with a waitress
at our favorite restaurant.

214
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,297
That's awful.

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,924
What kind of restaurant?

216
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,009
Dwight.

217
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,512
I couldn't afford the flat
myself. So I sold it at a loss.

218
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,265
Ah, but what's 10 years
of bliss down the drain

219
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,019
compared with the thrill of starting
over with nothing and no one?

220
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,355
I'm so sorry. These must
be very painful memories.

221
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,274
If it would
help you to forget,

222
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,068
I could hit you in the brain
stem with this candlestick.

223
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,363
Thank you. No.

224
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,787
Look, Jim, Dwight, please,
don't tell anyone about this.

225
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,205
No, no, of course.

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,711
Just one quick question,
was this Halloween or...

227
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,713
God, no.

228
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,090
That's the most
embarrassing thing of all of this.

229
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,677
What kind of fool gets her heart
broken by a bloody stage magician?

230
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,225
You know what, Pam? I was thinking
maybe we should change course here.

231
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,392
Let's give up on
all this mean stuff.

232
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,646
What? No. No. I just
had this brilliant idea.

233
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,855
Everyone loved it.

234
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,982
You don't have
a copyright on pranks.

235
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,109
I might be better
at this than you.

236
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,403
No, that's not... Jim,
could you give us a hand?

237
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,696
Absolutely. Yeah.

238
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,865
Call it
off, Pam. Call it off, okay?

239
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,116
It's way more complicated
than you think.

240
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,785
Cancel the magician.
Trust me.

241
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,830
Oh, okay.
Okay, I will.

242
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,708
That's a great idea.

243
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,293
Yeah. Okay.

244
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,586
Pam, we have a great
idea. - Listen to this.

245
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,588
We're going to have the
fluorescent lights flickering.

246
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,965
It's going to
make everyone sick.

247
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,217
Or what if...
Okay.

248
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,265
...we discuss the idea of
doing the party totally normal.

249
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,600
Like, not mean.

250
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,769
Just a regular party.

251
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,896
Not mean.

252
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,649
I knew she'd crack. I wanted
to leave you out, you know.

253
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,402
We're in far too deep. We
can't change course at this point.

254
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,946
What are you talking about?
Of course we can.

255
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,155
What I mean to say is
we don't want to.

256
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,867
Toots, we're not stopping
this train, so get off the tracks.

257
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,536
Suck it!

258
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,539
Andy.

259
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,376
It'll be fine. Just act natural.
Do you want a gummy penis?

260
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,795
No. I'll just have
some gummy bears.

261
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,046
These are delicious.

262
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,381
But they're penises.

263
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,842
And we come to Matthew,

264
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,594
the guy who was
with his old girlfriend

265
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,554
basically the whole time
we were together.

266
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,014
Oh, no.

267
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,476
Eww! That seems gross
at first blush, right?

268
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,980
But relationships are always
more complicated than you think.

269
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,858
I mean, we don't know Matthew's
history with this other woman.

270
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,945
Maybe she saved his life.
I don't know.

271
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,572
I just...
I don't think we should

272
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,865
rush to judgment
about Matthew.

273
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,158
Maybe we don't
pop that one.

274
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,076
No. Pop it.
Pop it!

275
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,202
Pop it!

276
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,040
Hey.

277
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,625
Sorry. It's kind of a mad house.

278
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,378
Oh, Megan.

279
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,256
You are one of the good
ones, Nard Dog. Aw!

280
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,175
No, really.
Where's my Andy?

281
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,385
He's out there.

282
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,429
Are you going to
sing for us?

283
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,974
Well, you guys are doing a pretty
good job with the scary yelling, so...

284
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:51,103
That's not like you. That's not
like you. Come on, sing! Sing!

285
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:57,360
By yon bonnie
banks and by yon bonnie braes

286
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,987
Okay, they're almost here.
What?

287
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,366
Come on! If you guys
are going to be mean,

288
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,742
can't you at least
be subtle?

289
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,579
Oh, in the warehouse,
we'd use code names

290
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,247
for people we
wanted to talk about.

291
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,042
Andy was "Jelly Roll." Mike
was "Dennis the Menace."

292
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,669
Ryan was "Douche Bag."

293
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,755
Hey, that's not a code name.
That's just an insult.

294
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,632
Plus, everyone would
know who you meant. Yeah.

295
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,301
No, that's a great idea.
Yes, let's have a code name.

296
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:26,097
How about "Mondays"? I hate
Mondays. Mondays are the worst.

297
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,181
Nobody's named Monday.

298
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,434
Hey, how about we go with
"Pam"? Simple, easy to remember.

299
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,145
Because there's someone
already here named Pam.

300
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,230
Shh. Here she comes.

301
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,314
Hey.

302
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,233
Welcome to your party.

303
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:41,320
Everybody, get comfy now. This
first song's over a half-hour long.

304
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,997
Best gig ever. They asked
me to play only originals.

305
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,833
I said, "Have you heard my
originals? They're terrible."

306
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:59,088
They said, "Even better." I said, "I
get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie."

307
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,257
Maybe we should just go.

308
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,717
No, I got to do this.

309
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,220
Hey, Jessica,
can I talk to you?

310
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,972
Uh, yeah, sure,
what's up?

311
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,557
Maybe we could
talk in private.

312
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,475
Yeah, what is it?

313
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,228
Well, first,
let me just say that

314
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,898
I hope when I'm done
with the sort of ugly bits,

315
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,775
that we can
stay friends.

316
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,027
You're breaking up
with me?

317
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,528
Uh...

318
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,280
No. No.

319
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,867
You always do this.
You twist my words around.

320
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,952
Part of me thinks we
should just end this right now.

321
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,373
Oh, my God. Are you
leaving me for Erin?

322
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,376
You said she wasn't relationship
material, and she wasn't as good as me.

323
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,711
But it's her, isn't it?

324
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,795
Whoa.

325
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,175
That... No.
Okay, you want honesty?

326
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,928
Super honesty time.
I'm gay.

327
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,555
What?

328
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,100
I am gay and
I prefer men.

329
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,185
I knew it!

330
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,478
You did not, Kenny.

331
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,271
You invited me to
go shopping with you.

332
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,650
I like hanging out with you.
You're a cool guy.

333
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,778
Which proves my point
that I'm gay.

334
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,988
Andy, you're not gay.

335
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:11,285
I mean, we were together and
you seemed pretty excitable.

336
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,498
Well, I was faking it.
I had to fake it every time.

337
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,667
I had to imagine that I was in a
steam room with John Stamos.

338
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,838
I can't say it
doesn't make sense.

339
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,383
Well, I mean, I was
good at hiding it...

340
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,302
It's fine, Andy.

341
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,597
I didn't think we were going
to get married or anything.

342
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,809
I just...
I'm just upset for now.

343
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:40,189
Understandable, and
I'm really sorry. I really am.

344
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,780
So, we should probably go.

345
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,125
This humble
but sincere effort is

346
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,044
all for our valued new
colleague. Excellent.

347
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,381
To Nellie Bertram,
you are a most welcome

348
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,383
and friendly presence
at our company.

349
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,218
Cheers.
Why, thank you.

350
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,347
Pam, on the other hand,
IS a most unwelcome,

351
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,059
entitled and unfriendly
presence in our company.

352
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,561
Cheers.

353
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,024
Nellie is terrific,
but to be honest,

354
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,319
every day, I imagine how
happy I'd be if Pam died.

355
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:35,161
Oh, well, I feel that as
someone who knows Pam,

356
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:40,124
only a little bit, enough, a good
amount, not the most, though,

357
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,126
I would say that
she is misunderstood,

358
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,129
and that maybe there's
some stuff in her past

359
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,964
that you guys
don't know about

360
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,507
that's a little
messed up and probably

361
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,217
makes her such a
torture to work with.

362
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:56,056
We hate Pam! We hate
Pam! We hate Pam! We hate Pam!

363
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,641
So we've established...

364
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,684
No.

365
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,769
...that you guys hate Pam.

366
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,940
Do you ever wish she
would just disappear?

367
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,609
Oh!

368
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,739
That was a really
rough scene.

369
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,616
Right? Rough scene.
Yeah.

370
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,995
At least we can kiss now.

371
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,455
Oh, yeah.

372
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,755
You know, that stuff that I said
about you to her, that's just...

373
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,131
I had to say it.

374
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,300
You know, I was
dating her at the time.

375
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,426
Yeah.

376
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,929
Yes, of course.

377
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,097
Ugh.

378
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,224
I feel really tired.

379
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,350
Yeah.

380
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,476
Probably from
seeing that turkey.

381
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
Oh, yeah.

382
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,481
When we drove by the farm.
Always does that.

383
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,032
Are you Nellie? I think
you're my volunteer.

384
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,242
Come on
over here, huh?

385
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,954
No, I'll do it.
I will volunteer.

386
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,789
No, Nellie should.
No, I'll do it.

387
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:08,254
Oh, big guy, huh? How's the
air up there? Watch out for birds.

388
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,425
All right, let's do
some card magic.

389
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,594
Now, what I want
you to do is,

390
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,305
I want you to pick a card
just by looking at it.

391
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,849
Do not say what it is.

392
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,687
It's the four of hearts.

393
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,563
Oh, no, it's...

394
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,109
Looks like we got a guy from
another country here, huh?

395
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,445
No hablo el cardo, sefior?

396
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,909
All right, the card is picked. Now,
sir, will you please shuffle the deck?

397
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,876
You didn't just do that
on purpose, did you?

398
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,921
Why is Jim treating
the magician poorly?

399
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,757
Little known fact about me,
before I was a magician,

400
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,802
I used to work
at a rope factory.

401
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,054
Not true because
that's not a real place.

402
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,975
But I never could seem
to figure out those knots.

403
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,977
That's not a real knot. When
you pull on it, it disappears.

404
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,061
What the hell?

405
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,606
All right! Where's
Phyllis? Who's Phyllis?

406
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:15,821
Look, this is really uncool,
okay? I put on a clean show here...

407
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,906
Okay, scram, wizard!
What?

408
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,074
You heard me!

409
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,910
Wow. Nellie, I'm
sorry. If I'd known

410
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,663
Jim and Pam
would use this party

411
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,874
as an excuse to
abuse a magician...

412
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,585
Well, I thought
it was quite fun.

413
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,963
In fact, I think they're brilliant
employees in their own way.

414
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,341
Don't you see
what I see?

415
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,719
Interesting, yes.
No, yes, I see that.

416
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,140
Great work, team.
Great party.

417
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,018
You think this
is a great party?

418
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:50,564
This cake has vegetables
in it, like a salad bar, Robert.

419
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,233
How do I get this
taste out of my mouth?

420
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,781
What? Why are we...

421
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,324
I just got to do
one thing.

422
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,998
Oh, hello.

423
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,209
Hey, everybody,
look who's here.

424
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,335
What are you doing here?

425
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,714
Hi. Super duper
honesty time, I'm not gay.

426
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,884
In fact, I'm so not gay
that I'm in love with a girl.

427
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,096
Her name is Erin Hannon,
and she is right there.

428
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,057
She's sweet,
funny and beautiful

429
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,892
and total
relationship material.

430
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,520
Why the hell did
you come back here?

431
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,938
Go away.

432
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,022
Get lost.

433
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,399
Get out!
Okay.

434
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,025
You're done! Get out!
Bye, guys. Go. Go.

435
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,151
You ruined my party.

436
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,571
Who does that?
Are you kidding me?

437
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,115
Yeah, run away.
Run away!

438
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,408
You're disgusting!

439
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,368
I can't believe
you're not gay!

440
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,787
Yeah,
get out of here.

441
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,955
Don't come back!

442
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,917
Uh-oh.

443
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,710
You don't even
know how to drive!

444
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,255
Loser! Nice car!

445
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,805
Hey, Hank.
Yes, ma'am.

446
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,851
I thought I was very specific
about you not letting up a magician.

447
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,978
Yes, ma'am,
I got my eyes open.

448
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,355
Well, turns out he
actually made it up there.

449
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,190
What? That ain't right.

450
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,733
Yeah, he came and went.

451
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,030
Wait a minute, you said
it was a magician, right?

452
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,742
You don't think he could have
used... It couldn't have been...

453
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,537
Let's just go.

454
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,705
Good night, Hank.
