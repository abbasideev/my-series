1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,964
Val, I need the space.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,966
All right,
guys, clear out.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,009
Everybody out!

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,302
Promise me you're
going to clean up.

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,637
I can't promise what
I'm going to do or not do.

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,722
Promise me...

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,098
Obviously,
I'm going to clean up.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,059
Stress is like the uptight
mayor of a town who's saying,

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,312
"Hey, we're uptight.
You can't dance."

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,107
And then, you have to be like, "Oh,
yeah, Mayor Stress? Well, watch this."

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,443
And then, we dance.

12
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,322
Oh, how we dance.

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,733
Sex also works.

14
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,300
Hey, Jim's back
from jury duty.

15
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,845
Hey! Tuna!
He's back!

16
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,389
Hey.

17
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,431
Oh, look at this.

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,267
Tuna wrap.
Okay.

19
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,061
Hand roll.

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,938
How was jury duty?

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,481
Pretty uneventful,
actually.

22
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,775
I can't believe they let
someone like you serve on a jury.

23
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,819
Makes me question
the whole judicial system.

24
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,112
What was the case?

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,280
A hit and run.

26
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,782
Ooh! The case of the hit
and run. That's exciting.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,200
Did you send him
to the slammer?

28
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,827
No. Not guilty.

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,537
Of course you
found him not guilty.

30
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,541
He apologized. And I
just really want him to like me. Mmm!

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,334
We're best friends,
actually.

32
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,461
We're going wine tasting next
weekend, if you want to come.

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,838
Not coming.
Have plans.

34
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
Okay.

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,425
I did get called
into jury duty.

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,385
And they
released me around noon,

37
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,470
so I didn't
think it was worth it

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,597
to come back to work
for a half day.

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,642
And then the next morning, Pam
was a little overwhelmed with the kids,

40
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,228
so I took an extra day
to help out.

41
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,690
And then,
three other days happened.

42
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,734
Ah!

43
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,736
Angela had the baby!

44
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,864
Is it black? Because
that would be hilarious.

45
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,032
Why?

46
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,117
You know.

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,078
Would it be more hilarious than
Angela having a Chinese baby?

48
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,915
A little bit. Yeah.
Right, guys? Back me up.

49
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,876
Maybe a little bit.

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,711
Oh. Did I win the pool?

51
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,297
Uh, no. Right month, wrong year.

52
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,467
No one won the pool. Angela
wasn't due for another month.

53
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,510
We should all go to
the hospital and visit her.

54
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,721
Oh, I'd love to, but...

55
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,349
Oh, man, I would, but I
can't miss any more work.

56
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,935
Well, Kevin and I have to go, because
accounting is its own little family.

57
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,815
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm
Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.

58
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,651
Everyone,
our very own Angela...

59
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,779
We all got the e-mail. Some
of us are going to go visit.

60
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,530
Oh, I am so in.

61
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,866
I love maternity wards.

62
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,202
It's the perfect blend
of love and horror.

63
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,038
Things can go SO
wrong or so right.

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,335
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us
your case. What were the deets?

65
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,045
It was actually
a pretty boring case.

66
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,173
How could it be boring? You
were there for five days. Titillate us.

67
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,510
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay
until 6:00 twice to cover for you.

68
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,387
My wife got to
the TV first.

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,056
I had to sit through damn
Rizzoli & damn Isles.

70
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,934
Yeah. My car got smashed
visiting one of your clients,

71
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,020
and I had to have it detailed
and they took my meter change.

72
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,397
Wow. I'm really sorry.

73
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,523
Yeah.

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,858
I never considered
that my week off

75
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,444
would make everyone
else's job harder.

76
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,656
The least I could do
was give them a good story.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,908
So Phyllis,
he was here and then,

78
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,577
the car came and
it was like that.

79
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,746
Yeah, so it had to be a
double backflip, actually.

80
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,375
You know, when I was on
♪-duties, strangler case,

81
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:15,338
we used to recreate the various
stranglings with empanadas from Ernesto's.

82
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,173
Oh, man, Ernesto's.

83
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,883
That was our
favorite restaurant, too.

84
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,219
You mean food truck.
Ernesto's was a food truck.

85
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,846
Toby, shut your hole
about the empanadas.

86
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,764
Nobody cares
about the empanadas.

87
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,558
I was in Los Angeles
last year.

88
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,103
Jim tricked me into thinking
I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS,

89
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,146
but that's not important.

90
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,774
While I was being kicked off the
lot, I saw food trucks everywhere.

91
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,734
Everyone in Los Angeles
eats from them

92
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,821
and nobody calls
them restaurants.

93
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,622
Guys, I don't know
how many of you have seen...

94
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,458
Gabe, bring it in.

95
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,461
I don't know how many of you
have seen a premature baby before.

96
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,422
It's going to be really tiny, so
please don't say anything offensive.

97
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,048
Got that, bimbo?

98
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,633
Got it, bimbo.

99
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,886
Yes?

100
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,013
Knock, knock.

101
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,723
- Hi.
- Uh...

102
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,479
I don't want... What are
you guys doing here?

103
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,856
We wanted to say hi to the
newest little Dunder Mifflinite.

104
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,528
Well, meet our not-so-little
bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.

105
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,155
Philip is so fat.

106
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,364
Kevin.

107
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,867
You warned me not to say
anything if it was tiny, Oscar.

108
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,828
You didn't prepare me
for a big, giant, fat baby.

109
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,747
Yes, he's substantial.
Hey!

110
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,750
He's more than substantial.
He's a monster.

111
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,004
So this whole
hit and run thing,

112
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,006
there's this one part
I can't figure out.

113
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,549
You said it was
at a four-way stop?

114
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,634
Mmm-hmm.

115
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,804
And the victim rode his bicycle
into the left-hand turn lane,

116
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,599
but the perp was already in
the left-hand turn lane?

117
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,934
Mmm-hmm.

118
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,771
See, that's what I'm having
trouble with, because the fact is

119
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,483
you never said he
was on a bicycle.

120
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,365
Busted, Halpert! Yes!
Wait. No.

121
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,616
Andy, get out here!

122
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,825
I never said he
was on a bicycle.

123
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,244
I just said I
wasn't listening to you.

124
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,578
I am making
a citizen's arrest.

125
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,913
You have the right
to remain silent.

126
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,206
You have the right
to beg for mercy.

127
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,334
You have the right to request
judgment by combat! Dwight's rights!

128
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,877
What's up, gangsters?

129
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,713
Jim was lying
about jury duty.

130
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,133
He was lying the whole time so
he could go do yoga or go canoeing,

131
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,719
I don't know what this
pervert likes. Fire him!

132
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,889
Dwight, not everything
is a conspiracy theory.

133
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,434
I have Jim on the record
saying that the victim...

134
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,645
Dwight,
I have me on the record

135
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,856
saying to you, take
a chill pill, all right?

136
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,483
I don't need to
take a chill pill.

137
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,818
Here, right there.

138
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,906
Down the hatch.

139
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,784
I really don't want
to take a chill pill.

140
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,454
That a boy, good.
Now, chill.

141
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,539
Okay, okay.

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,212
But let's just
say that Jim was lying about jury duty,

143
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,880
you would have to
fire him, right?

144
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,593
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I'd fire him to Timbuktu!

145
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,760
Ha-ha!

146
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,180
Good enough for me.

147
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,391
Ah!

148
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,439
And Pam was just going crazy
trying to take care of Philip,

149
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,858
because Cece has been
out of control recently.

150
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,613
Look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The
truth is I just feel terrible lying to you.

151
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,032
I feel terrible
getting lied to.

152
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,367
No one's ever
lied to me before.

153
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,454
Okay.

154
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,372
I think the best
thing to do right now

155
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,249
is just come clean
and tell everybody...

156
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,127
No. Not after what I told
Dwight about firing you. No.

157
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,211
Here's what
we're going to do.

158
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,881
We're going to have ourselves
a good old fashioned cover-up.

159
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,259
You ever heard of a
Connecticut cover up? No.

160
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,345
You know why you
never heard of it?

161
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,471
Covered it up.

162
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,515
Are you sure you can
keep this under wraps?

163
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,434
They used to
call me King Tut,

164
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,103
because I'm so good at
keeping things under wraps.

165
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,856
My nickname was
actually King Butt,

166
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,691
because I had
a king-sized butt.

167
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,743
Where do you
want it parked?

168
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,665
Okay, everybody!
Gather round.

169
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,792
Got a real special
surprise for you.

170
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,085
Ernesto!

171
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,795
Hola, Toby!

172
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,138
Uh, I'm going to say "I"
when I'm talking for Ernesto,

173
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,474
so instead of,
"He says blah, blah, blah,"

174
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,435
I'm going to say, "I say blah,
blah, blah," but that's for him.

175
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,398
Anyway, it was something
like, he remembers Toby.

176
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,233
"I remember Toby."

177
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,737
Oh, Jim. Hey, this
guy look familiar?

178
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,364
It's the empanada guy.

179
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,573
The empanada guy!

180
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,119
Holy . Damn it, Toby.
No, I wasn't asking you.

181
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,746
Ask him if he
remembers Jim.

182
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,752
No.

183
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,170
He says no.

184
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,505
He says no. Boom!

185
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,132
Yeah, but who remembers
all their customers?

186
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,342
I mean, I can name
like three of our clients.

187
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,470
He remembers Toby, the most
forgettable man in the known world.

188
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,685
He doesn't want
any trouble.

189
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,353
He sees lots of people,

190
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,273
they come from all around to
eat his delicious meat pockets.

191
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:29,485
Uh, you guys are going to love
these, SO empanadas on me.

192
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,570
You guys got to try them.

193
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,907
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if
you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.

194
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,785
Great. And while we're enjoying
these delicious empanadas,

195
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,163
Jim, why don't you
tell us your story again?

196
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,330
Why? Everybody's heard it.

197
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,124
Walk us through it.

198
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,667
What time would you
get there every morning?

199
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,753
Hey, Murder, She Wrote,

200
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,381
how about we drop the whole
Murder, She Wrote thing, okay?

201
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,426
Jim was at the courthouse
for jury duty every morning.

202
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,179
How do I know?
Because I drove him there.

203
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,765
Why?
Why?

204
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,391
Why?

205
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,686
Because my car broke down.

206
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,772
His car broke down,
so he called me

207
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,939
because I live
near the courthouse.

208
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,984
Wait, wait,
you live by the courthouse.

209
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,446
You drove from near the
courthouse out to Jim's house

210
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,989
and then back to
the courthouse?

211
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,617
Thirty minutes out, 30
minutes back, easy hour.

212
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,494
And I would watch
that cute, little tooshy

213
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,829
scurry up those courthouse
stairs every morning,

214
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,581
and that was that.

215
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,044
I'm sorry, do you have
any American Mexican food?

216
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,296
We're getting
buried out there.

217
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,006
What was that stuff about
the car breaking down?

218
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,883
Well, I think you
handled it pretty well.

219
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,428
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim, I can't
keep spinning gold out of your.

220
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,138
Okay, listen, all right?

221
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,432
Dwight's onto us. He's going
to figure it out really soon.

222
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,351
So let's just get ahead
of it. Let's tell the truth.

223
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
I don't even know what
the truth is anymore.

224
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,815
Wow, it's so

225
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,817
healthy.

226
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,444
I'm going to call
him Little Kevin.

227
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,904
No, you will not.

228
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,324
Is he really five pounds?
Because I squat with five pounds.

229
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,951
This...

230
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,370
Yeah, this
feels like more than that.

231
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,081
No, no, no, he's nine
pounds, seven ounces.

232
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,917
Nine pounds? Really?

233
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,838
I thought you said five. You know
what? I was under so many drugs.

234
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,633
I felt like I was at a James
Taylor concert or something.

235
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,802
So, what did you bring?

236
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,972
Oh, yeah, I don't know
if it's right, but...

237
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,350
Well, if it's anything like that
gorgeous wrapping paper,

238
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,518
you hit it
out of the park.

239
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,895
Oh!

240
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,730
Preemie pajamas.

241
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,524
Again, it may not be
the right size, I can...

242
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,986
No, I think he came early
just so he could wear these.

243
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,195
Thank you.

244
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,698
I got Little Kevin
Call of Duty.

245
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,242
This baby is
clearly not premature.

246
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,202
They're lying about
the date it was conceived.

247
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,162
It's very interesting.

248
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,333
And her husband's gay. I don't
even know which thread to follow.

249
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,678
Uh, excuse me, can I have
everyone's attention for a second?

250
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,513
First off, I just want to
say that I'm really sorry.

251
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,390
I didn't know that
my absence last week

252
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,225
would have been
a burden on any of you.

253
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,395
Because, though I did
have jury duty last week,

254
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,982
they did dismiss me
early on Monday.

255
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,819
And I think you're going
to find this pretty hilarious.

256
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,865
I kind of, well,
maybe took the week off.

257
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,242
What?

258
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,369
Funny? No? Nobody laughed.

259
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,456
You're screwed.

260
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,460
Oh! It's happening.
It's really happening.

261
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,296
What the hell, Jim, I
covered for your bony butt.

262
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,590
Pam really needed some help
with the kids, so...

263
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,175
I promise my
intentions were good.

264
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,885
Your clients,
they're all mine.

265
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:45,306
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because
one of your orders got messed up.

266
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,767
And Andy, you said you
drove him to the courthouse.

267
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,060
Uh, I did.

268
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,189
Every morning. And if I
didn't, then I hope I die.

269
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:58,027
All right, well, let's get this
show on the road, shall we?

270
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,030
Allow me to give you
a hand. Here we are.

271
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,240
So long, clump mate.

272
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,576
I'm going to miss you.
Truth be told,

273
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,329
I never thought that this
was how it was going to end.

274
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,456
I always thought I was
going to defeat you somehow,

275
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,666
but you've
defeated yourself.

276
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,877
Dwight, cut it out.
I'm not firing Jim.

277
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,629
No, no, no, no,
you said...

278
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,464
I know what I said.

279
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,635
Jim, you're in deep
doo-doo, you understand?

280
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,011
And I have one
thing to say to you,

281
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,305
and I'm going to say it in
front of this whole office.

282
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,723
Look me in the eye.

283
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,478
That's it?

284
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,314
This is crap!

285
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,069
You've reached
Gabe Lewis. I'm currently indisposed.

286
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,071
Leave me a message. Ciao.

287
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,322
Gabe, it's Dwight again.

288
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,491
Highest priority,
triple urgent.

289
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,160
Call me immediately.
That means ASAP.

290
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,663
I'm going to find Gabe,
tell him what Jim did

291
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,749
and let the little stickler do
what he does best, stickle.

292
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,420
Honestly, I can return
this for a larger size.

293
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,423
It's fine. Pajamas aren't
supposed to be baggy, right?

294
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,757
It's not the barrio.

295
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,595
The only premature baby in this
room is the baby this baby ate.

296
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,808
Little Kevin.

297
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,727
Really?
Angela.

298
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,270
Fine. God.

299
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,897
Philip was conceived
nine months ago.

300
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,818
The Senator and I
wanted to wait,

301
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,195
but we had just seen Thor,

302
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,698
and there was way too much
wine in my chicken piccata.

303
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,533
Chicken marsala.
Right.

304
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,203
And, the point is, Philip was
conceived out of wedlock.

305
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,371
Hmm.

306
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,708
And now you all know,
but you can never tell.

307
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,585
I'm serious.

308
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,463
Dwight.

309
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,672
Hey.

310
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,840
Oh. Hey, have you
seen Gabe?

311
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,092
He went to the car or
something, but he'll be back.

312
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,469
Okay.

313
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,890
Don't you want
to see the baby?

314
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,310
Why? I know what Angela
and the Senator look like.

315
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,729
I can mash that up
in my head right now.

316
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,067
I promised I
wouldn't tell.

317
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,359
So don't.

318
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,072
Angela got pregnant
before the wedding.

319
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,366
What?

320
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,743
She got pregnant
before the wedding.

321
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,495
How long before?
A month.

322
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,294
You didn't hear it
from me.

323
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,754
Yes, I did.

324
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,052
Dwight?
Dwight.

325
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,178
I want to see the baby.

326
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,181
Well, Angela will make you cut
your fingernails. It's not worth it.

327
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,100
Oh!

328
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,601
Yes.

329
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,520
Oh!

330
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,483
What a beautiful child. Prominent
forehead, short arms, tiny nose.

331
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,861
You will lead millions,

332
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,864
willingly or as slaves.

333
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,369
That baby is a Schrute, and
unless somebody taught Mose sex,

334
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,371
that baby is mine.

335
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,290
He's hungry.

336
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,459
Oh, that's my cue
to leave.

337
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,253
No, you don't have to. I'm
going to wear this cover.

338
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,504
Still.

339
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,256
Still.

340
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,465
You won't be seeing...

341
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,885
Do you want the giraffe?

342
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,888
Yes, I am bringing my kids
in to help me get out of this hole.

343
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,723
And you all remember
my beautiful wife, Pam.

344
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,850
Hi.

345
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,811
Wow, I really thought I'd
be more excited to be here.

346
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,688
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Game
face, baby. Game face.

347
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,814
Oh, right. Okay.

348
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,607
Hey, Stanley,
it's great to see you!

349
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,650
No, that's overdoing it,
I think.

350
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,819
Hi, Stanley.
Split the difference.

351
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,571
Jim.
Okay. Let's go.

352
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,030
Hi.

353
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,825
Hi, everybody.

354
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,493
What?
Oh, hi.

355
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,953
How about
a little visit?

356
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,998
Wow. What a surprise.
That's crazy.

357
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,000
You guys get to meet
the little heck raisers.

358
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,751
Hey, Angela's back
with her baby.

359
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,503
Yes, well, you guys
all know Cece,

360
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,589
but we wanted to
introduce you to baby Philip.

361
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,718
You guys.

362
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,014
He's licking on my finger
just like my cat does.

363
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,223
Let me have a turn.

364
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,349
No, it's
the pacifier's turn.

365
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,475
All right.

366
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,186
Did you say
something about

367
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,439
this one bringing in
something for these people?

368
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,692
Yes. Cece wanted
to thank everybody

369
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,237
for letting her daddy stay home
with her all last week and play,

370
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,906
so she brought
you a little treat.

371
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,157
Oh, cookies?

372
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,783
No. But that would have
been a really good idea.

373
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,868
That would have
been really good.

374
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,621
No, she
brought you drawings.

375
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,207
Oh, my goodness,
let's take a look at these.

376
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,920
They're usually amazing,
so let's see. Yep, they are.

377
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,379
Uncle Andy.

378
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,505
Oh!

379
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,840
Aunt Phyllis.

380
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,093
Wow. These are incredible.
Cece, did you do these?

381
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,220
No.

382
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,973
She says no to everything. You
know, she thinks my name is "No."

383
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,892
Cece, do you want
some broccoli?

384
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,976
Yes.

385
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,061
No.

386
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,938
It's crazy.

387
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,649
Why am I shorter than the
table that I'm standing next to?

388
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,818
There is
crosshatching in some of these.

389
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,737
That's kind of advanced
for a 2-year-old.

390
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,448
Cece, this is your
big sister, Kelly.

391
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,408
Did you color
this pretty picture?

392
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,534
No.

393
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,828
So then this
means nothing to you?

394
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,665
Hey, Cece,

395
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,461
why don't you draw another
picture for us exactly like this one,

396
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,589
or at least in
the exact same style?

397
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,842
You know what? I don't think
you need to do things on command.

398
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,762
That's very weird. Just
take that. Thank you.

399
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,015
I think we should just wrap
up the show, kiddos, right?

400
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,309
I don't know what
else we can do here.

401
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,770
Okay. All right.

402
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,563
It's okay, sweetie.
All right.

403
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,274
All right. Okay.

404
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,695
It's okay.

405
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,488
I know. I know.
Shh.

406
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:41,120
Angela, this child is definitely
mine. He looks just like me.

407
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,913
Every baby
looks just like you.

408
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,373
Your face kind of
looks like a baby.

409
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,961
Need I remind you that we were
together a month before the wedding?

410
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,130
That is completely untrue.

411
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,214
Completely true.

412
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,299
Remember?
No.

413
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,259
You said that Robert
was not fulfilling you.

414
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,677
And I said that I
could fulfill you,

415
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,053
and you said,
"I'd like to see you try."

416
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,306
And then I kissed you with the
force of a thousand waterfalls.

417
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,724
That didn't happen.

418
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,392
Then I inserted my
penis into your...

419
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,019
No! Stop it! Dwight.

420
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,228
...vagina and...

421
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,521
And even if it did,
it's just a coincidence.

422
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,148
Admit that there is
a chance. I will not.

423
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,232
Admit it.
I will not.

424
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,275
It's not...

425
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,569
All done?
Yes.

426
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,237
Yes. He's sleeping.

427
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,072
Before I go, may 1?

428
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,574
Sure.

429
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,827
Watch the head.
Watch the head.

430
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,589
Nurse! You know that
baby in there? Baby Philip?

431
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,132
Cancel the circumcision.

432
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,216
Who are you?

433
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,055
I just might be his father.

434
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,766
I don't know
what that means.

435
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,435
We're going to
circumcise him.

436
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,855
Cece, want to come?

437
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,898
No!

438
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,524
Want to come play?
Oh, bud, I know.

439
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,567
Do you have a pacifier?

440
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,611
Yeah. I'm looking. I'm
looking for the pacifier.

441
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,696
Cece!
Okay, we're going.

442
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,115
We got to go. All
right, we're going home.

443
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,952
I know. I know, bud. I know.

444
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,831
You gotta grab her.
I'll go grab her. Okay.

445
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,250
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

446
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,753
Okay, I'm just going to go down
to the car, and I'm going to put her

447
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,630
in her seat and
I'll be right back up.

448
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,549
We'll see you tomorrow.

449
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,759
No, no, it's okay.
I'll be right back.

450
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,927
No, just go home.

451
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,054
It's all good.
We got this.

452
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,597
I have a kid.

453
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,766
Last week,
Jim at home,

454
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,977
that was no vacation.

455
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,562
Jim, just go.

456
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,606
Hey, we'll be just fine.

457
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,901
Thanks, guys.

458
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,654
All right, here we go.
Let's go.

459
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,156
Oh!

460
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,449
Phew!

461
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,044
Dwight, what the hell?

462
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,713
You can't smoke in here.

463
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,298
Oh, all right.

464
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,259
Ah!

465
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,636
The office looks
different now. Mmm.

466
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,054
Smaller.

467
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,723
Maybe I just feel bigger.

468
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,100
Hello, Gabe.

469
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,309
You had something
important to tell me?

470
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,523
Oh. You know, I did, but now
it seems infinitely insignificant.

471
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,902
Jim? Oh, right.
No, forget it.

472
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,488
He was doing it
for his kids. I get it.

473
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,116
Kids drive us dads crazy.

474
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,909
Sometimes I feel
like they're raising us.

475
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,619
Am I right?
