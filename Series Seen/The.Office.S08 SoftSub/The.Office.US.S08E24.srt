1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:06,548
Hello, my name is Oscar. I'm an
accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,632
and I am gay.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,094
And I'm here to tell you
that, yes, it does get better.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,305
When I was younger...
What? What's he doing?

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,182
He's searching out
younger gays.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,851
No, it's just a way
to tell young people

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,020
no matter how hard
it gets for them

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,313
there's a brighter
future ahead.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,606
With you.

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,863
No matter how hard it gets
for you... Kelly, seriously, I...

11
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,282
Just keep chatting. I'm just
checking my makeup in your webcam.

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,700
Do you not own a mirror?

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,244
Webcams make me look
the way I look in my fantasies.

14
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,623
I know, right? What is it? You
always look so good in those things.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,874
I'm throwing out
all my mirrors.

16
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,876
Okay, as you can see,

17
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,503
I now have a cool job
at a dynamic workplace.

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,549
Being gay is a celebration
of life. It's a simple...

19
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,552
I'm sorry. I just
can't sit idly by

20
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:56,014
and have
the gay youth of America

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,557
misled by
some reductionist...

22
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,642
I'm not misleading.

23
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,852
...pep talk.

24
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,482
Sexuality is a spectrum.

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,653
It's a paradox to think of
any sexual activity as normal.

26
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,282
It gets better, but it also
gets vastly more complicated.

27
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,744
Hey, Robert? That guy,
he looks just like you.

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,830
Damn it! Kevin. God!

29
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,460
You okay, Robert?

30
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,753
I'm fine.

31
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,255
Put some ice on it.

32
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,298
In any case,
it gets better.

33
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,346
Maybe not much better,
but better.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,181
It hurts.

35
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,818
One, two, three.

36
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,613
I wanted to give a nice
gift to the tenants in the building.

37
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,365
At first I thought,
"Muffin basket.”

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,285
Then I thought, "What's even more
precious to people than muffins?”

39
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,703
Can you just
smile, please?

40
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,037
I don't want to!

41
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,123
Their own children.

42
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,624
Hey, everybody.

43
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,168
Just a few hours left for
the free family portrait studio.

44
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,504
Darryl, we'd love to see
little Jada come by.

45
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,466
Angela, why don't you
bring by your little angel?

46
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,718
No, thank you.

47
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,678
Jim, you've got
those two cute kids.

48
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,054
We sure would
love to see them.

49
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,223
I know why you're
doing this, Dwight.

50
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,059
Last week, I may
have gone too far.

51
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,811
I'll explain it quickly.

52
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,314
Basically I found out where
he gets his clothes dry-cleaned,

53
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,524
custom-ordered the same
suit made with tear-away Velcro

54
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,652
and you can
fill in the rest.

55
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,030
What?

56
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,366
Damn it, Jim!

57
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,037
Now he's trying to get me to
bring my children into work.

58
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,456
I think it's fair
to be cautious.

59
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,084
Let me get this straight,
you lost all of it?

60
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,423
All your winnings,
$150,0007

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,345
You mean to tell me
no one wanted

62
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,138
an energy drink
for Asian homosexuals?

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,431
They did not.

64
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,434
You've got
half-a-million of these?

65
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,231
Well, I've got to try it.
I wouldn't.

66
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,025
Oh, come on.
What's the harm?

67
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,904
Hmm.

68
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,822
What flavor is that?

69
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,410
The coconut's pretty subtle.

70
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,871
Come on, man. Can you
just give us a yes or a no?

71
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know, man. You all
quit with a lot of confidence.

72
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,171
I mean, you all came up in here
dancing and everybody was...

73
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,131
Ooh! Hold on a second.

74
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,055
If I were Val, I would
break up with Brandon.

75
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,307
Then I would date
the hell out of me.

76
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,767
I wouldn't give in
to me too fast,

77
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,478
let me buy myself some
nice dinners and such.

78
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,982
When I finally did give in,
I would go crazy on myself.

79
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,911
Hi, guys.

80
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,996
How's it going, man?

81
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,333
I'm... I'm good.
Thank you. How are you?

82
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,710
Great, yeah. Good.

83
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,966
Oh, how the mediocre
have fallen.

84
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,594
Oh, God.

85
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,888
Look, I'm not here
to get my old job back.

86
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,432
I had my opportunity,
I blew it.

87
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,558
I'm moving on.

88
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:31,396
Just wanted to come in here
and literally beg you

89
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,606
for something, anything.

90
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,276
I will sweep the floors,
water the plants.

91
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,485
No, you don't...
Clean the toilets.

92
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,279
I don't need anyone... Pull
the poop out of the toilets.

93
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,156
Not even a thing.
Just please...

94
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,699
Andy. Andy.

95
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,617
Please give me something.

96
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,705
Why don't you clean
the carpets for today?

97
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,540
Thank you.

98
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,042
Well, you're...
Up you get, then.

99
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,546
Pick yourself up.

100
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,755
There it is.
Thank you.

101
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,632
You don't need to.

102
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,474
I have a delicious secret.

103
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,481
Good, good. This carpet's
overdue for a good mopping.

104
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,734
Is a mop the most efficient
tool to use on a carpet?

105
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,611
Yeah, it is, actually.

106
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,449
I can't hold
it in any longer.

107
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,367
I am faking this, okay?

108
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,745
Because I convinced
David Wallace

109
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,247
to buy Dunder Mifflin
back from Sabre

110
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,501
<i>and at 3.00 today he's
going to walk in here</i>

111
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,378
and reinstate me
as manager.

112
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,423
Family picture.

113
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,593
Pam. No.

114
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,262
What? Honey, we talked
about this.

115
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,515
No, we talked about
not bringing them

116
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,683
into Dwight's photo
studio/trap.

117
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,602
Yes, and then we decided
that was crazy.

118
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,271
No, we decided it was
crazy not to worry about it.

119
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
No, we settled in a
much more rational place,

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,441
remember?
No.

121
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,693
We decided that there's no
way Dwight would harm a child.

122
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,863
But are you 100% sure?
I don't think any of us are.

123
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,031
No, no.

124
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,115
Nope.

125
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,785
But it's free and we'll
keep our eye on them.

126
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,869
Yes.
Yes, that's...

127
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,871
And we will make sure that
Dwight doesn't do anything...

128
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,206
Okay.
...C-R-A-Z-Y.

129
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,125
Wait. C-R-A-Z...

130
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,127
Great, right up there.

131
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,130
You sit right here,
one time.

133
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,549
There you go.
Okay.

134
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,883
All right, why don't you
just give him to me?

135
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,218
Oh, great. Thank you.

136
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,469
Perfect.

137
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,263
This is great, excuse me.

138
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,347
You ready? There you go.

139
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,431
Okay.
All right, let's do it.

140
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,766
I'll just stand here then.

141
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,434
Yeah, just keep your eye
on Dwight. Okay, yeah.

142
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,769
Sir, could you
look into the camera?

143
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,479
Let's do it.
Shoot it. Great.

144
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,730
Sir.
Up here.

145
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,068
Jim, right here, right
here. Okay. Good.

147
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,237
Oh, so that's it?
That's it.

148
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,738
See, that wasn't so hard.

149
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,240
Cute kids.
Thanks for coming.

150
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,078
Hello, Erin.
Hello, everybody.

151
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,914
What, why? Hi, honey.
What... How are you doing?

152
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,583
You know,
my office got a call

153
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,711
that they were shooting
family portraits right here.

154
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,006
And if there's one thing every
politician instinctively understands,

155
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,465
it's a good photo op.

156
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,386
Okay, you're going to go
through the hallway.

157
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,847
Here's a map. And if you get
lost just follow the blue line.

158
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,142
Thanks.

159
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,188
Well, well, well,
Senator Lipton. Welcome.

160
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,732
Angela.
Dwight.

161
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,816
Nice to see you.

162
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,318
May I hold him?
Sure.

163
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,196
No. I am going to hold him
because I haven't seen him all day.

164
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,366
I think that Dwight
is doing this whole thing

165
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,161
to get a sample
of my baby's DNA

166
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,038
to prove he's the father.

167
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,041
Which is impossible.

168
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,294
Because the Senator is the
only man I've ever been with.

169
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,256
Did you see that?

170
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,175
What do you think
about that? See?

171
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,803
See that ducky?

172
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,930
Okay, hold on
a second, folks.

173
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,599
A few of the baby's hairs
are out of place.

174
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,476
Oh, thank you.
No, no, no.

175
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,227
I like the baby's hair
the way it is.

176
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,021
Really?

177
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,232
This is getting more and
more delicious by the minute.

178
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,451
It's go time.

179
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,537
Hey, Nellie.
I made... I made you...

180
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,790
I made you some soup.

181
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,541
Well, I don't
want any soup.

182
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,793
But it's really good.

183
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh! Come on, Andy.

184
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,256
Ah.

185
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,892
I know this is going
to be a great payoff.

186
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,811
A delicious moment.

187
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,521
But after you're manager,

188
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,816
some of these images are
going to be hard to shake.

189
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,819
Well, but it's...
Just calibrate.

190
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,613
Okay? Calibrate.

191
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,449
Okay, here we go.

192
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,327
Oh, you know what? I don't want
to throw a wrench into the works,

193
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,246
but I want everything
to be perfect

194
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,123
and the baby's fingernails
are just bothering me.

195
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,166
Uh-uh. Leave us alone.

196
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,918
I guess we're okay
with the fingernails.

197
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,962
Okay, great.
Suit yourself.

198
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,340
Although,

199
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,134
aren't those
excess skin cells

200
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,261
in the baby's cheek
distracting to you as well?

201
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,304
Dwight! We're fine.

202
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,725
Oopsie! Did somebody
make a poopsie?

203
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,270
I'm just going to take
him out and change him

204
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,730
just for a second here.

205
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,064
He defecated.

206
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,149
Ooh!
Oh!

207
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,358
Stinky.

208
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,361
A lot has changed
since you all left, okay?

209
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,655
You're going to have to
jump through some hoops.

210
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,240
And the new foreman is here.

211
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,618
Now, she's one of the best
we've ever known, okay?

212
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,204
So I need you to show her
your utmost respect.

213
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,665
Make sure that
she feels welcome

214
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,625
and at home, okay?
Can you do that?

215
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,919
That's some pretty blatant
complimenting you're doing there, man.

216
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,880
I don't even talk to her
like that. - Uh, Brandon.

217
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,047
I would.

218
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,549
You would?
Yeah.

219
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,134
Sounds like you're trying
to hit on my girlfriend.

220
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,427
Calm down. He's not.

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,636
Yes, I am.

222
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,347
Just so everyone's
on the same page.

223
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,516
So you really
think she's going to

224
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,976
leave a guy who owns
his own restaurant

225
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,020
for a dude who ate his
own restaurant? Brandon.

226
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
Good slam.

227
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,398
Thank you, Biggie.

228
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,608
Good luck to you.

229
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,109
Oh, and have
a burger for me.

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,116
Okay, shall we
take a few more?

231
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,994
I think we have all the shots
we need. Thank you, Dwight.

232
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,040
Okay, here we go.
Yes, here we go.

233
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,012
No, Dwight! Give
me the diaper! Dwight!

234
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,233
Is this what
you were looking for?

235
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,401
Huh? Huh?

236
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,656
Andy, we wanted
to talk to you.

237
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,742
A lot of us are very
concerned about you.

238
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:05,206
You're dirty, you stink of
booze, you're limping inexplicably.

239
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,166
I just want you guys
not to worry

240
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,126
because old Andy's
going to be just fine.

241
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,920
No, no, no, see, this is
what we're talking about.

242
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,673
I mean, what was
that accent?

243
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,634
And last time I checked you were
drunk and now you're not drunk.

244
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,389
No, unfortunately,
it's true.

245
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,474
He's been a nightmare

246
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,352
and the worst part is he's
been taking it out on me.

247
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,145
- You hit her?
- What?

248
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,858
No, no!
That is not the deal.

249
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,068
Calibrate.

250
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,614
He's not hitting me, but he's
been verbally abusing me.

251
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,449
That is
not true, either!

252
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,871
That's also total... Everyone please relax.

253
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,665
I think you're going to
like this surprise guest.

254
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,253
Happy birthday to Gabe.

255
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,297
Oh, get out,
Skeleton Man.

256
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,261
I can refer you to
someone to talk to.

257
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,387
Huh?

258
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,055
I can give you a name.
Hold on.

259
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,599
I'm just going to... Hello?

260
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,976
Hey, what's the scoop?
Are you close?

261
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,107
What? No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. You have to come now.

262
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,404
Traffic clears.
No, next Friday.

263
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,659
That's not going to work.
Okay, yeah, okay.

264
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,163
Damn it.

265
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,584
Well, this is not going to be
quite as delicious as I wanted,

266
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,587
but I do have a very tasty
announcement for you guys.

267
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,591
Not only am I not
a lowly janitor,

268
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,260
I am the regional manager
once again.

269
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,095
Guys, I got
my old job back.

270
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,640
Oh, boy.
Oh, Andy.

271
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,852
I'm not crazy. I convinced David
Wallace to give me my job back.

272
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,647
David Wallace hasn't
worked here in years.

273
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,732
Okay, yes,
I see the confusion.

274
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,484
I saw David
at the fundraiser.

275
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,319
He is now
a multi-millionaire

276
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,613
because he sold
his toy vacuum "Suck It"

277
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,031
to the U.S. Military.

278
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,200
Andy, come on, man.

279
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,994
I... Okay, I get how
that sounds crazy.

280
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,122
Andy, nobody's calling
you crazy, Andy.

281
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,791
We're your friends, Andy.

282
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,084
Stop saying my name.

283
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,169
No, he's not making
this up. Thank you, Erin.

284
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,880
Andy tells me about seeing
David Wallace all the time.

285
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,801
But have you ever
actually seen him yourself?

286
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,346
Oh, my God. Wait.

287
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,181
Erin, come... Come on.

288
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,142
You know I've been
talking to David Wallace.

289
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,938
Do you see David Wallace
in the room right now?

290
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,200
Operation Phoenix is a go.
Just get the car ready.

291
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,953
Okay, you look at me
like you're adoring me

292
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,996
and I'm going to
look at the camera

293
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,080
like I don't even
know you're there.

294
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,498
But I do adore you.

295
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,090
Andrew, it's time
for you to go home.

296
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,884
You're better than this.

297
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,012
Yeah, I know.

298
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,388
Everyone is
better than this.

299
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,600
Because this is the worst
thing I have ever seen.

300
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,899
Why did they add coconut?
I miss original.

301
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,527
- Hey.
- Hey.

302
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,112
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

303
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,780
Hey, guys, long time.

304
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,741
David, what are
you doing here?

305
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,784
Is it true you're
buying the company?

306
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,829
Okay, I guess
the word is out.

307
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,208
Please keep this a secret, but
yes, I've been talking with Andy.

308
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,211
What? I thought
I heard my name. What?

309
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,464
I'm the new manager?

310
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,923
I'll get to that
in a second, Andy.

311
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,801
But it's...
It is me? Right?

312
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,969
Yes,
as we discussed.

313
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,137
What?

314
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,306
Oh, my God!

315
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,807
It's very possible...
Probable.

316
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,559
Wow. From janitor
to manager?

317
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,643
Yep.

318
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,149
It's quite a Cinderella
story. From M-O-P to MVP.

319
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,235
There's an official
announcement. A few details...

320
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,947
From total loss
to total boss. I mean...

321
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,991
Can we expect
any payroll interruptions?

322
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,868
Now that is
a great question, Stanley.

323
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,244
Right now I think
all your operations,

324
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,747
or most of your operations
are pretty much down in Florida,

325
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,915
so the shift back...

326
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:21,087
I was so looking forward
to that and it did not go

327
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,130
as I thought it would.

328
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,608
So we're not going to be
a part of Sabre anymore?

329
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,735
Actually nothing is going to
be a part of Sabre anymore.

330
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,279
Jo Bennett's planning on
liquidating the rest of the company.

331
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,865
Oof!

332
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,202
Wouldn't want to be a Sabre
employee right about now.

333
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,039
I'm actually the CEO.

334
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,499
Ah!

335
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,959
I didn't realize
you were standing there.

336
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,335
Hey, my friend, trust me.

337
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,797
This is for the best. I never
understood that corporate mess.

338
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,799
Well, okay.
Well, great to meet you.

339
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,843
Likewise, I'm Bob,
Bob Kazamakis.

340
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,386
Pleasure.

341
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,388
I'd love to give you
a little rundown

342
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,181
on what I've learned
about this place.

343
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,850
That's very
gracious of you, Bob.

344
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,643
I would love that.
Please.

345
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,526
I guess I better
take off these dirty rags

346
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,072
and figure out how to be
a manager of this place.

347
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,283
Perhaps your
year of experience

348
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,160
managing this branch
will come in handy.

349
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,411
Gosh, I hope so.

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
No! God, Mose. God!

351
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,170
Hi, Angela.

352
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,338
Get out of the car!
Get out!

353
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,217
Where is he? Where is he?

354
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,344
I'm not supposed to say.
Yes, tell me!

355
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,679
Tell me where he is!

356
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,184
Mose! Damn it!
Where did he go?

357
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,269
Mose, get back here!

358
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,940
See that smile.

359
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,530
Jump in here.
Come on.

360
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,475
Looks like I might get my
delicious moment after all.

361
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,810
May I say one thing?

362
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,774
It would be rude of me not to let
you say whatever's on your mind.

363
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,819
"The quality of mercy
is not strained."

364
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,905
No.

365
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:57,326
"It dropeth as the gentle rain from
heaven upon the place beneath."

366
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,663
Do not bring Shakespeare
into this.

367
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,082
How dare you play
the "Bard Card."

368
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,752
"It blesseth he who gives
and he who takes.

369
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,171
"'Tis mightiest
in the mightiest."

370
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,842
I just want one mother
delicious moment.

371
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,512
Is that too much to ask?

372
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,560
If I were to
hire you back, if,

373
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,648
what do you think
you would do well?

374
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,526
Special projects manager.
That's my background.

375
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,569
I just go around
doing whatever I want.

376
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,323
All right, you sly bastard,
when can you start?

377
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,377
Okay, everyone.

378
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,422
I had a conversation
with Bob

379
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,550
and since I am going to be CEO
now, there'll be no need for him.

380
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,219
Ouch! That's got to hurt!

381
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,264
But he is going to make so
much money from the liquidation,

382
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,432
he's going to be
freed up to do

383
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,225
something much
more important. What?

384
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,981
David has generously offered to
donate $1,000,000 in matching funds

385
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,234
to a cause
that's very dear to me.

386
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,946
So for the next three years,
I'll be traveling overseas,

387
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,326
concentrating all of my
efforts on educating, mentoring,

388
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,456
some African, some Asian, but
mainly Eastern European women.

389
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,541
I had no idea
how pervasive

390
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,084
this problem was until
Bob explained it to me.

391
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,046
Oprah Winfrey's
Leadership Academy,

392
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,924
and other schools like it, while
wonderful, end with high school.

393
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,260
I want to see these girls
right through college.

394
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,179
Especially the gymnasts.

395
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:45,851
They've lost so many years
of crucial education

396
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,436
to perfecting their bodies.

397
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,105
Muscle groups the rest
of us can't even fathom.

398
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,693
Gymnasts? You're going to
seek out uneducated gymnasts?

399
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:59,865
Yeah. So I'm hoping to identify
some truly exceptional women

400
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,284
who show great promise.

401
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,162
Well, Andy, it's been fun.

402
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,455
Hmm.

403
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,132
It's been a great year.

404
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,350
Hello.
Where is it?

405
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,395
They're testing it now.

406
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,105
How long does it take
to get the results?

407
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,564
Seventy-two hours.

408
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,982
You're going to wait here?

409
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,110
Yes.

410
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,129
Dwight, I can't do this.
Dwight!

411
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,851
Senator Lipton.
Hey.

412
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,060
Hey, how are you?

413
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,186
You didn't call.

414
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,980
Um...

415
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,816
Well, the issue
that concerned me...

416
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,526
You know what
this is about.

417
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,862
Call.
