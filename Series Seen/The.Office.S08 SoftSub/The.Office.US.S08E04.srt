1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,297
Hey. So we saw
a new billboard.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,591
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,844
What better way to announce
our new slightly lower prices

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,846
than with an ad campaign?

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,225
And what better face for an ad
campaign than our new regional manager?

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,769
How'd it look?
You've seen it, right?

7
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,272
Andy, somebody
defaced it.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,858
What? How?

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,319
Morning, Stanley.

10
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,867
There's this thing that people
tend to do with billboards.

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,744
How do I put this?

12
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:42,375
If there's an opportunity for a
graffiti artist to work in a phallic shape

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,921
interacting with the
artwork, it'll happen.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,633
And Andy gave them
that opportunity.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,885
Erin, how long did we order
those billboards for?

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,762
Six months.
Oh, God.

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,430
I need you to call
the billboard company.

18
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,768
Great billboard. Funny, edgy, right up
to the line without crossing it. Loved it.

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,478
Which one did you see?
Washington Street.

20
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,272
The one with like 20 dongs
on it. Okay. Don't be gross.

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,566
What's going on? Somebody
defaced the billboards

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,319
we just put out
in an inappropriate way.

23
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,196
That's funny.

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,201
Wait, from the photo
shoot with you and me?

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,619
Yeah, Dwight.

26
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,163
No. No.

27
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,751
No, no, no, no, no, no!

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,506
No, no, no, no, no, no!

29
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,843
No, no, no, no, no. No!

30
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,994
Schrute Farms
is very easy to find.

31
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,912
It's right in the middle of
the root vegetable district.

32
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,289
If the soil starts
to get acidic,

33
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,623
you've probably
gone too far.

34
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,500
Just give us the address,
we'll look it up online.

35
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,460
It's simpler this way.
It's really not.

36
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,213
Now, stated arrival
time is 3:00 p.m.

37
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,091
I don't get the reason for this
party. Yeah. What's the reason?

38
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,176
What's the reason, Andy?
What's the reason?

39
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,721
It's just a garden
party. Sheesh!

40
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,973
You don't need a reason
to throw a garden party

41
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,393
any more than you need a
reason to throw a birthday party.

42
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,396
It's a garden party.
You don't need a reason.

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,399
A few other super simple
reminders. No burping, no slurping.

44
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,736
When eating, take small bites and
chew thoroughly with your mouth closed.

45
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,987
Yes, Darryl?

46
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,530
What happens when
we're done chewing?

47
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,908
Do we spit it out on the floor or keep
it in our mouths the rest of the time?

48
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,827
I get it. I'm being
a little overbearing.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,746
But I promise to be
under-bearing for a week

50
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,582
if you guys just
all step it up.

51
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,834
Andy, we understand basic
table manners. We're not children.

52
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,252
Yeah. It's just
a picnic.

53
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,339
This is not a picnic, Phyllis.
It's a garden party.

54
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,007
There's a grill in the
warehouse I could bring.

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,384
Oh, ew. Please
don't. Not a barbeque.

56
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,472
It's better than a barbeque. It's
dignified. Quieter. There are rules.

57
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,723
How is that better
than a barbeque?

58
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,309
What's the dress code
on this? I'm glad you asked.

59
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,518
Connecticut casual.

60
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,772
Any chance Connecticut casual
is Pennsylvania business?

61
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,940
I.E., this is what
I'm wearing to your party.

62
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,486
Guys, my family just threw a garden
party to celebrate my brother's promotion.

63
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,987
It was a huge success.

64
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,489
Check it out.
There's a video online.

65
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,992
Heartwarming impromptu
father/son duet.

66
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,535
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,953
Yeah. Oscar,
you showed me this.

68
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,455
I've seen this.
That's not you.

69
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,998
Yeah. Who's the sausage?

70
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,666
It's
my dad and my brother.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,377
I would have joined in,
but this melody

72
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,713
doesn't really support
another harmony part, so...

73
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,090
Check it out.
That's my brother's boss.

74
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,384
Look how psyched he is.
He's having an awesome time.

75
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,510
Ah.

76
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,388
And did Robert California
get an invite to your party?

77
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,516
Yeah, of course. I
mean, yeah, I think he did.

78
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,645
Why didn't you just say this
was to impress Robert California?

79
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:53,691
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing
a party like this just to impress the CEO.

80
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,693
Classic Gabe move.

81
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,780
Hey, Andy, how about you
don't steal my business strategies

82
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,325
and I won't dress like my life
is just one long brunch.

83
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,495
See you all there at 3:00
p.m. Connecticut casual.

84
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,747
Remember your manners
and have a wonderful time.

85
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,459
And please refer to the map.
Stay off of the web.

86
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,211
Thank you.

87
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,630
So, we've typed in
the address.

88
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,882
Now let's take a look
at the street view.

89
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,513
They don't warn you when
the cameras are driving by. Ah.

90
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,224
Why do you keep reading
that garden party book?

91
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
I mean, how hard are
finger sandwiches and tea?

92
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,645
There's so much
more to it than that.

93
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,439
I've been wanting
Schrute Farms to break into

94
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,607
the high-end event hosting
industry for some time,

95
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,277
and this party is
a great opportunity.

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,654
Plus, I've got
a secret weapon.

97
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,574
Only one copy
in the world,

98
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,035
and some sucker on the
Internet sold it to me for $2.

99
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm actually really disappointed
in how poorly my book is doing.

100
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,294
I've only sold one copy.

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,548
Is there anything you wish you'd
done differently to avoid cankles?

102
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,550
Nope.

103
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,968
I've already gone up
another cup size.

104
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,554
The senator
is grossed out.

105
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,515
When do you start
feeling it kick?

106
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,227
Cece was around 22 weeks,
but Philip was much earlier.

107
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,562
Philip?

108
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,650
Oh, my gosh. Yes. But
don't say anything, okay?

109
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,152
It's after my grandfather.

110
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,404
Philip is the name
that we're using.

111
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,947
It's after my favorite cat.

112
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,324
Oh, wow.

113
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,826
Funny. It's after
my grandfather.

114
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,245
It's after my cat.

115
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,832
Andrew, I picked up two
possible gifts to bring this afternoon.

116
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,584
One, a pot of marmalade.

117
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,544
Ooh, that sounds great.

118
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,421
That is what you want
then? The marmalade?

119
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,672
Sure.

120
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,968
You don't want to hear the
other one. You love marmalade?

121
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,970
I'll hear the other one.

122
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,430
It's a basil plant.

123
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,808
You know, the marmalade
sounds great.

124
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,813
I also mentioned the marmalade to
my sister, and she's very interested.

125
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,774
Then the basil will be fine.

126
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,067
Well, you clearly want
the marmalade.

127
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,278
Gretchen, I need
another marmalade.

128
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,905
All right.

129
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,290
Hey, where do I park?
I'm the valet.

130
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,001
You have to give me your car. I'm
parking. I can probably park it myself.

131
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,545
I'm the valet. You have
to give me your car.

132
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,921
It's probably okay
that I park...

133
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,006
No. I think it's
probably better that I...

134
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,675
I'm the valet.
You have to give me...

135
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,136
It's a finicky car. Get
out of your car. Get out.

136
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,850
Have a good time
at the thing.

137
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,645
It's a little tricky.
You might want to...

138
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,625
Mr. Ryan Howard!

139
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,378
"Chapter Two. Announcing
guests as they enter

140
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,088
"is the height of decorum.

141
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,884
"The more volume displayed, the more
honor is bestowed upon everyone present."

142
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,180
Stanley Hudson
and his mistress Cynthia!

143
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,854
James, Pamela
and Peepee Halpert!

144
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,525
How's it going over here,
guys? Andy, stop hovering.

145
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,610
You're being
really annoying.

146
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,194
Didn't mean
to bother you, Mable.

147
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,114
"Mable, Mable,
if you're able,

148
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,700
"keep your elbows
off the table." Wow.

149
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:35,038
Mr. and Mrs. Walter
and Ellen Bernard!

150
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,292
So you all work
with Andy?

151
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,713
Well, technically, for Andy.

152
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,091
Technically, for Robert
California. He's our CEO.

153
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
I thought you
were the CEO.

154
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,638
I don't know how
you got there.

155
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,431
You said you were
running the company.

156
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,558
This branch.
I'm the regional manager.

157
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,727
Yes. Well, that makes
more sense.

158
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,063
Are you all
regional managers?

159
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,442
Did I throw this party to
impress my parents? That's crazy.

160
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,695
No, if they wanted a garden party,
they could throw one themselves.

161
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,822
Which, as a matter of fact,
they did last week.

162
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,743
They threw one for my baby
brother, and it was totally amazing.

163
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,912
But I couldn't care less.

164
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,915
Can I introduce
you around now?

165
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,669
Yeah, we don't have too long.
We have theater tickets.

166
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,878
What are you
going to see?

167
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,254
Moneyball.

168
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,258
It was
Walter Jr.'s choice.

169
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,593
There he is. What?

170
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,928
Bro-nard.

171
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,013
I didn't know you were
going to be here.

172
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,598
I wouldn't have missed it.

173
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,600
Okay.

174
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,604
Ahh!

175
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,523
I'm Walter. I'm Andy's
younger brother.

176
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,233
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Jim.

177
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:51,739
Tuna, right? And this must
be your lovely wife, Pam.

178
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,824
Hell no.
No.

179
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,452
She wishes. No,
no, no, no, no. No.

180
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,540
Sir, I need to be able to feed
all the guests. I understand.

181
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,958
Excuse me.

182
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,130
Set that down.

183
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,137
Present yourself.

184
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,160
"Chapter Four. One of the
host's most important duties

185
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,828
IS as dance master.

186
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,416
"A proper courtly dance sets
the tone for the entire afternoon.”

187
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,141
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present

188
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,812
Robert California!

189
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,359
Hello, Andy.
Welcome.

190
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,195
Thank you.
Hey, I want you to meet

191
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,281
my first bosses,
Mom and Dad.

192
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,200
Yes. Hello. Nice to
meet you. Pleasure.

193
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,037
Andy, where shall I put
your basil plant?

194
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,289
I thought you were going
to bring the marmalade?

195
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,042
No. I'm certain
you said basil.

196
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,964
This is not funny, man.
Let me down.

197
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,885
I think this thing is broken. It's not
broken, Kevin. This is how it works.

198
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,890
It's so pretty today.

199
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,809
It's getting chilly.

200
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,102
Yeah. We really
should be leaving.

201
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,521
Yeah. Um...

202
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,607
It'll be weird if the boss-man
didn't make a toast, so hang on.

203
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,487
Everybody, I just want to take this
opportunity to thank you all for coming,

204
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,116
and to raise a glass
to my amazing staff.

205
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,953
Toasts are great.
I mean, you toast somebody,

206
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,455
they toast you back.
It just goes round and round.

207
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,583
That's my favorite part
about toasts, the reciprocity.

208
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,086
Let's hear from you guys.
Who do you want to toast?

209
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
Yeah, I'll say something.

210
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,174
I think we should be
acknowledging our boss

211
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,426
because none of us
would be here without him.

212
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,928
Robert California.

213
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,013
- To Robert.
- Yay, Robert!

214
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:27,436
I cannot believe I didn't think of
toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel.

215
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,689
Why are you talking
to Stanley's mistress?

216
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,650
I would like to toast
someone who isn't here,

217
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,986
but who will be
in just four short months.

218
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,156
Welcome to the world,
Philip Lipton.

219
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,449
Aww.

220
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,206
I also would like
to toast Philip Halpert,

221
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,916
who's due even sooner.

222
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,461
May he be a good namesake
to my grandfather,

223
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,466
who I promised as a child,
long before tonight,

224
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,469
that I would one day
name my son after him.

225
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,639
To Philip Halpert.
To Philip.

226
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,724
All right.

227
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,311
She just always has
to copy anything I do.

228
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,856
It's the Ford Taurus
situation all over again.

229
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,525
I'd like to make
a toast to the troops.

230
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,651
Here, here.
Yes.

231
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,446
All the troops.
Both sides.

232
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,074
I think
we should toast...

233
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,161
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Last Supper.

234
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,753
"Chapter Nine. The tableau
vivant is not only welcome,

235
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,632
"but expected entertainment
at any garden party."

236
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,884
Andy?

237
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,595
I think that we should
acknowledge the man

238
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,181
who has led us to such
a profitable quarter.

239
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,185
To Robert California.
Yeah!

240
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,397
I would also like to toast
Robert California. Mr. California...

241
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,816
You can't triple
toast somebody.

242
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,861
At least not until
we hit everyone once.

243
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,781
I'll say a few words if that's
all right with you, Andy.

244
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,532
Yeah.

245
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:10,039
You people say I led you,
but it wasn't me.

246
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,336
You want to toast the man
who led you to success,

247
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,296
but the boss is irrelevant.

248
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,133
Andy and I produce
nothing. We do nothing.

249
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,387
We sit in our offices
and demand,

250
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,808
"I want this and that right
now" like petulant children.

251
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,020
You know the difference between
a crying baby and a manager?

252
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,772
One day the baby
will grow up.

253
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:43,489
But without you, Andy and I
would be sitting in our dirty diapers

254
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,409
waiting for someone
to change us, wipe us.

255
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,704
I should be toasting you,
thanking you,

256
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:54,000
for allowing me to have the
easiest job in the universe.

257
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

258
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,421
To Robert California.

259
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,965
From the moment you entered
our building and our hearts, you...

260
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,886
Some of you know that we have
an Internet star in our midst.

261
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,433
Mr. Walter Banes Bernard, Sr.,
please report to the stage.

262
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,268
I'm eating, Andy.

263
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,186
Come on.

264
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,648
Okay. All right.

265
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,066
Okay.

266
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,901
Yes. Yeah, what
do you want to do?

267
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,363
Well, how about one of
our classic father/son duets?

268
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,365
Oh, whoa.

269
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,491
You sure?

270
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,077
Really?
It's a little tricky.

271
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:39,503
Saying I love you
Is not the words

272
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,714
It's too high. It's high but
it's not that high. Really?

273
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,008
Right. It feels strained.
Yeah. Just take it down.

274
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,095
Saying I love...

275
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,930
Saying I love you

276
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,224
Here. Just give it
to me. Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,434
Okay.

278
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,521
Something like...

279
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,735
Saying I love you
is not the word...

280
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,861
You don't come in yet.

281
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,572
...I want to hear from you

282
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,909
It's not that I want you

283
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,538
Not to say
but if you only knew

284
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,541
More than words

285
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,296
Is all you have to do
to make it real

286
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,800
Is anyone filming this?
Seriously. Erin!

287
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,260
It's either taping
or calling.

288
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,765
What would you do

289
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,185
If my heart was torn in two

290
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,687
You know what?
Walter Jr. is here.

291
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,272
Why don't you come up and
join us? - Yeah, no.

292
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,024
No, come up and do something
with me. I don't know, Pop.

293
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm just having a good time
getting to know Andy's friends here.

294
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,402
Get up there and sing,

295
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,322
or I will cut your larynx and
you'll never be able to sing again.

296
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,032
Whoo! Come on!

297
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,827
Come on.
Give them what they want.

298
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,746
All right. This old thing.
I don't even...

299
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,502
May the good Lord be with you
Down every road you roam

300
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:09,093
And may sunshine and happiness
Surround you when you're far from home

301
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:16,183
And may you grow to be proud
Dignified and true

302
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:22,982
And do unto others
As you'd have done to you

303
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,777
Cheers! All right.

304
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
What's going on? Cheers,
cheers. Get your own guitar.

305
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,124
Sorry. RECORDED VOICE:
Please hang up and try again.

306
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,447
I am so cold. It's because
you didn't bring a jacket.

307
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,159
My first love is beet farming,
but it's a young man's game.

308
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,829
Whoever heard of an old
beet farmer? Forget the beets.

309
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,081
Concentrate on the hosting.

310
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:26,253
I can spend a considerable amount of
money having my birthday party here.

311
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,797
Really? We have a number
of birthday packages.

312
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,550
The Pewter package has
the least amount of goats.

313
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,136
It's not no goats,
it's still 10 to 12 goats,

314
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,596
depending on the
availability of the goats.

315
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,933
Now the goat package, obviously, has
the most goats. What were you thinking?

316
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,062
Of course I am not
interested in goats.

317
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,232
Why would you spend so much
time going over the goats with me?

318
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,027
I can get you
exotic meats.

319
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,197
Hippo steaks.
Giraffe burgers.

320
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,407
We'll talk.

321
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,955
It'll all be goat.

322
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,209
Hello, Cece Halpert.
This is Andrew Bernard.

323
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,088
I'd very much like to speak with
you about your paper supply needs.

324
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,884
That wasn't even
my worst sales call.

325
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,512
Hi.

326
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,475
What was that display?

327
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,688
I don't know.
I just thought

328
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,232
if I could throw
this great garden party

329
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,027
and show you how respected I
am, that you'd be proud of me.

330
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,321
Andrew.
I know.

331
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,323
I know that you're
proud of me.

332
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,450
I'm not going to tell you
how impressed I am

333
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,788
that you're a manager
of some rinky-dink branch

334
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,791
of a paper company
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

335
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,836
How long are you going to
go on needing my approval?

336
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,715
You're a grown man. Don't
act like a little boy who needs...

337
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,676
I think if I had
parents like that,

338
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,013
I'd be trying to convince everyone
all the time how great I was, too.

339
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,557
Guess we found Andy's
Rosebud. Rosebud?

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,975
It's a reference
to Citizen Kane.

341
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,186
Something that explains why a
person became the way they are.

342
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,566
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud
didn't explain why he was how he was.

343
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,278
It just represented what was important
to him as a child, that he missed.

344
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,155
Different school of thought.
Let's just agree to disagree.

345
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,906
No. You're wrong.

346
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,869
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm too hot anyway.

347
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,247
My body has somehow become
acclimated to southern Italy.

348
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,582
Isn't that strange?
I've never been there.

349
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,002
Oh! Ah. Well.

350
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,295
Yes, that's nice.

351
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,713
Thank you.

352
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:39,762
It was a nice party. The setting
was a little strange. The food...

353
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,096
Sandwiches were dry.

354
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,848
Bye, Tuna.
Bye, Pam!

355
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,068
Hey, everybody,
I'm going to leave,

356
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,279
and I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

357
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,198
Cheeseburger
or hamburger?

358
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,243
Um...

359
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,954
Cheeseburger.

360
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,331
Nard-Dog.

361
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,794
Thanks, Oscar.

362
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,230
What are they doing?

363
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,023
Closing ceremonies.

364
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,150
Nice touch.

365
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,921
I think I left my wallet in
your house. Who cares?

366
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,049
Right here.
Mr. James Halpert!

367
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,342
Keys. My keys.

368
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,178
Stop forgetting things. I didn't
forget them. They're right here.

369
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,473
Mr. James Halpert!

370
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm so sorry.
I think I forgot the...

371
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,645
What...
You idiot.

372
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,898
Ooh.
Mis...

373
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,943
Mi...

374
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,112
What are you doing?
Hey, I have a question.

375
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,407
Who do you think is really
the best salesman in this office?

376
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,202
Stupid question, obviously...
Mr. James Halpert!
