1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,090
<i>Oh, man, my delis
are blasted.</i>

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,928
I wish they had a chart for how
much protein powder to scoop

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,389
for a 180-pound
man with no fat.

4
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,392
Protein powder, huh?
You cut it with water?

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,394
Why don't you
just take estrogen?

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,478
Here.

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,530
There you go, boys. See
how Papa takes care of you.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,076
I remember when people
thought biceps were all that.

9
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,370
They'd flex them all
night at the discotheque.

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,539
I bet you think it's
all about core, huh?

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,624
Yeah.

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,209
Core's critical.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,086
There are four tenets of
Pilates that I live my life by.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,671
One, lengthen.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,548
Two, elongate.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,884
Listen, guys. I think we all want
to know the same thing, right?

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:51,968
Who's the strongest?

18
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,471
There's only one
way to solve that.

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,098
Thigh curl contest.

20
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,309
All right,
here we go, everybody.

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,269
May the manliest man win.

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,354
Go!

23
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,650
Feast on this, Lewis!

24
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,071
I love the burn.
The burn is where I live.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,240
Come on, Gabe. You
can't handle his hamstrings.

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,991
You're getting hypno-thized.

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,493
Speed set. One...

28
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,870
One, two...

29
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,747
Here, this is for your elbows.
For your elbows.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,831
Thank you.
You're welcome.

31
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,500
- Five, six...
- Seven.

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,087
Quick phone call for you guys.
Keep going. Eight.

33
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,255
Nine.

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,839
- Hello?
- Ten.

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,341
We got it?

36
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,303
Very funny, Jim.

37
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,429
Yeah, Jim.

38
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,556
Way to mock us for
perfecting our bodies.

39
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,976
Everyone, conference room.
Now.

40
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,566
All right.
Easy there, Grandpa.

41
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,068
I don't need your help.

42
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,653
Okay, you don't
need my help?

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,321
Here, here, just...

44
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,877
Morning.

45
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,632
Somebody left in such a hurry
this morning that she forgot

46
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,093
these.

47
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,928
You know, the only thing
more delicious than your feet

48
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,348
is the feast that I am going
to prepare for everyone.

49
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,019
Andy, if you're going
to hang out for a while...

50
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,103
Uh...

51
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,272
What's this?

52
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,566
This dumb,
new rule Robert made.

53
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,693
He just wants
visitors to sign in.

54
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,695
Is this Robert's
attempt to embarrass me?

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,530
No, of course not.

56
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,743
It's just... I think it's like if
we make an exception for you,

57
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,495
then we have to make an
exception for the water guy,

58
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,998
and then it's like, "Where
does it end?" So, just...

59
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,500
Why is it when other people
spend all their time at the office,

60
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,337
they're rewarded for it,
and when I do it,

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,756
I am told,
"It's a little much"?

62
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,052
Is it because I'm not
an employee anymore?

63
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,928
Because that's
what it feels like.

64
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,096
All right,
enjoy the Illinois game.

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,139
Good, we have a deal?

66
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,391
Thanks, Janet.
Thanks so much, Earl.

67
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,060
Wow. A simultaneous sale.

68
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,895
And they said it couldn't
be done. Boom. Screw them.

69
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,439
A lot going on, guys.
What's happening?

70
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,940
The Binghamton
branch closed last night,

71
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,442
and all their
clients are up for grabs.

72
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,444
That was a fine branch.

73
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,698
Things are really bad under
Robert California, I guess.

74
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,033
It's like a festival of poo.

75
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,451
Hey, come on, language.

76
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,828
Yeah, and we're not interested
in your sour grapes, okay?

77
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,789
Jim, tell him where he
can stick his grapes.

78
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,415
In the fridge.

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,125
No, Jim.
The butt, in his butt.

80
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,835
Sorry, man,
I can't focus on zingers.

81
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,337
There's too many
potential clients.

82
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,005
You two better
watch yourselves.

83
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,507
Yeah, the Syracuse
branch can't be happy

84
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,092
you're taking
New York clients.

85
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,319
Robert, why did
Binghamton close?

86
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,863
Can everyone just...
Please.

87
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:06,371
I had a one-man
saturnalia last night

88
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,457
in celebration of the
finalization of my divorce.

89
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,628
I got into a case
of Australian reds,

90
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,673
and, how should I say this,
Colombian whites.

91
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,261
Wait, what is this
about Binghamton?

92
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,638
The branch closed, forever.

93
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,228
Closing the Binghamton branch
never occurred to me before today.

94
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,189
Or, I guess, last night.

95
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,359
But, in vino veritas,
as they say.

96
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,946
I'm not going to start
doubting my drunken self now.

97
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,494
I got your voice
mail from last night.

98
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,331
Wonderful.

99
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:56,921
And the answer is yes,
yes, yes, yes,

100
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,882
and never.

101
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,603
Pam, when's the last time
you lived so intensely

102
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,856
that your brain, literally,
couldn't hold the memories in?

103
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,066
It was the summer...

104
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,276
Apparently,
I left a phone message

105
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,905
for Nellie last night, and I
need you to find out what I said.

106
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,282
Um, I am a little busy.

107
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,575
Yes.

108
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,285
Of course.

109
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,499
Why don't you list the things that
would keep you from helping me?

110
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,085
Yeah. I can make you a list.

111
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,670
Let's do it now.

112
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,507
What's number one?

113
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,094
Why don't I help you
now? Okay. There we go.

114
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,227
Who the hell are Jim Halpert
and Dwight Schrute?

115
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,853
Jim, Dwight,
what are your last names?

116
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,563
And you are?

117
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,358
Harry Jannerone,
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.

118
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,447
What the hell's all this?

119
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,242
Cherries jubilee
over home-made gelato.

120
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,788
You live well down here in PA. I
want to talk to you guys right now.

121
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,331
And Lloyd Gross, too.

122
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,208
Which one's that guy?

123
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,335
The salesmen have
a commission cap,

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,003
but we figured
out a way around it.

125
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,923
Lloyd Gross is a fictional
salesman we invented to...

126
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,135
How do I put this? Steal from the
company, embezzle, to commit fraud.

127
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,596
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but
it helps us get more money.

128
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,722
Yes.

129
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,932
Pam made a drawing
of Lloyd.

130
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,434
He is a blend of
all the salesmen.

131
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,063
There he is.

132
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,232
That's Lloyd.
Me?

133
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,025
Yeah, you.

134
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,611
Where do you get off
crossing state lines?

135
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,240
Now, we're actually closer to
Binghamton than you are,

136
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,658
kemo sabe.

137
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,077
I like to think Lloyd Gross
IS a no-nonsense guy

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,538
who doesn't back
down from anybody,

139
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,832
and he calls
people "kemo sabe."

140
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,959
They're New York,
we're New York.

141
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,752
State line is
the dividing line.

142
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,546
That's the way
it's always been.

143
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,840
There's actually not a
rule that says that. It's true.

144
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,135
It's true. There's no rule. You
can check the employee handbook.

145
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,178
Can I check
the employee handbook, Lloyd?

146
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,806
Does it say anything about me
choking a man with my bare hands?

147
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,975
No.

148
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,395
Wait, no? Are you kidding me?
You told me there was a rule.

149
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,564
I could have choked
SO many people by now.

150
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,192
Stay out of my state. It's in your
best interest to stay out of my state.

151
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,695
I've seen guys
like you, big guys

152
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,530
who like to push
the little guys around.

153
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,575
Lloyd Gross eats bullies
like you for breakfast.

154
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,994
Stay out of New York, Lloyd!

155
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,873
Text from the old wife.
I'm going to take that.

156
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,130
How about this, why
don't we just ask Robert?

157
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,549
Can we all agree that maybe
the CEO should decide this?

158
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,051
Robert's here?

159
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,304
Look at us,
bickering like school girls,

160
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,057
looking around the room for
things to hit each other with.

161
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,683
I don't think we
were doing that.

162
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,561
Chair, lamp, plant,
table leg, Jim's leg.

163
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:05,026
Where's the Advil, Jim? I think
I've hit my limit on the Tylenol...

164
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,110
Sorry, not Jim.

165
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,071
Andrew, what do we
have to do to get rid of you?

166
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,282
Hire you back and send
Erin back to Florida?

167
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,993
Message received
loud and clear.

168
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,578
Just have to get
the caramelized sugar

169
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,913
off the pan
before it dries.

170
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
Oh, for God's sake...

171
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,460
Robert California, what a
surprise you're here in Scranton.

172
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,544
Harry.

173
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,338
So, why would you
close Binghamton down

174
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,215
without a transition plan
in place?

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,383
How do you mean?

176
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,550
I forgot...

177
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,013
No, no, no, kid, stay there.
Do your dishes. Go ahead.

178
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,391
Harry, there is a time
for every decision

179
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,434
predetermined
many years ago.

180
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,645
There's no benefit
in questioning why

181
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,481
this particular
decision seems

182
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,317
so poorly timed.

183
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,070
Okay, what are you deciding?
We get a say.

184
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,365
Listen, Robert, I don't have
time. There's a big client in play,

185
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,991
Prestige Direct Mail Solutions

186
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,243
used to be Binghamton's...
Don't listen to him.

187
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,452
Nope.
I want it. It's mine.

188
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,537
Prestige is ours.

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,913
Okay, they're responsible
for half of the junk mail

190
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,581
on the eastern seaboard.
We get them.

191
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,083
We already put
a call in to them, Robert.

192
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,793
We need you to
make a decision.

193
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,795
Make a decision.
I have decided.

194
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,257
Neither of you are
to have any contact

195
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,678
with either Prestige
or any other Binghamton client

196
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,806
until I've figured out
how to divide things up.

197
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,684
As Solomon once said...

198
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,065
There's some bizarre energy
in this place today.

199
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,944
Robert going off the rails,
making some funky decisions.

200
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,029
Like why is nobody
going to call on Prestige?

201
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,489
That is a huge client.

202
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,032
They could give
their business to

203
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,659
the first person to
walk in the door.

204
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,411
Could be any idiot.

205
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,787
Any idiot at all.

206
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,378
Shaping a company is, in a
sense, similar to training a geisha.

207
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,090
You have to mold
not merely the physical form,

208
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,428
but also the character.
The two must harmonize.

209
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,639
Are they still there?

210
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,436
They want a decision,
who gets the big client.

211
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,272
They can wait.

212
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,318
I'll still be talking about
geishas long past their bedtime.

213
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,529
You know, I trained as one.

214
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,824
Is it just me, or is our
boss a freaking weirdo?

215
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,370
I'm going to get some air.

216
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,963
Jim, you know what would
be really dastardly?

217
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,342
If we snuck out of here
and got to the client first.

218
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,937
He's running!

219
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,065
Damn it!

220
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,108
Damn it.

221
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,153
What... What is
this supposed to be?

222
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,238
It's a monkey.

223
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,199
Jim, get real.
This is not a monkey.

224
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,700
It's got a hula skirt
and a blue nose.

225
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,202
Hold on. Hold on.
Is this him?

226
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,995
What?
Is that him?

227
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,248
It's him! Do
something! Get out! Go!

228
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,707
What? What am I
going to do? I don't...

229
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,918
Go slash his tires!
Go dent his hood!

230
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,839
That's it?

231
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,549
That's great.
That's like a 5-second delay.

232
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,800
Dwight!

233
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,926
Go!

234
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,179
Does this thing have turbo?
Nitrous? Hit the NOS.

235
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,598
NOS? You mean like
in Fast ♪ Furious?

236
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I
definitely have NOS.

237
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,560
Hit the NOS.
Are you sure?

238
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,604
Yes. We got it! Go! Brace
yourself. Three, two, one.

239
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,064
Here we go!

240
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,072
Hello. Andy Bernard
to see the CEO.

241
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,365
Oh. Do you have
an appointment?

242
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
No, I do not.

243
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,451
Okay. I think I can
squeeze you in.

244
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,954
Seriously?

245
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,332
Because I could just
be anyone. I thought

246
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,126
I was going to
have to convince you.

247
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,961
He's really not that busy.

248
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,254
Is there someone
here to see me?

249
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,589
Yes. This man.

250
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,173
Come on in.

251
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,098
So, what do you make of
this Robert California guy?

252
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,810
What does a guy like that
do on an average weeknight.

253
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,021
I'll tell you what he does.

254
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,607
Hello.
Hello, my clucking hens.

255
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,942
Got room for
another in the roost?

256
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,153
Huh? Don't worry.
I won't lay an egg.

257
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,282
Robert sent me to
take over if Pam fails.

258
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,659
If?

259
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,788
I have been
crunching numbers all day.

260
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,582
Math is for boys.

261
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,168
I need girl talk.

262
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,296
Did someone say "girl talk?"

263
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,134
Sometimes I wonder if I
have ovaries in my scrotum

264
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,553
because I am
great at girl talk.

265
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,598
Have you guys been watching
any good Korean soap operas?

266
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,808
I'm pretty deep into
Hee-Jung Cinderella Girl.

267
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,312
Although, I definitely fast-forward
through the Yung Tae storylines.

268
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,315
Do you think I'd like that? Or is it
important to have an Asian fetish?

269
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,027
I think you're going to need
to have an Asian fetish. Yeah.

270
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,780
It'll be
upsetting if you don't.

271
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,908
I'm a former paper executive. I
know the product. I know the margins.

272
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,702
I can save you
25% on your costs.

273
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,622
Why haven't I heard of you?
You got any references?

274
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,624
No. I'm a rogue.

275
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,542
Uh-huh.
Which is the best part.

276
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,836
That means you will
be my first customer,

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,215
and your business will
get 100% of my attention.

278
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,719
Now, I have written down
my personal phone number.

279
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,264
You call this any time.

280
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,726
Every salesman I've ever met has
given me his personal phone number.

281
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,689
Of course they have,
which is why I'm giving you

282
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,525
a key to my house.

283
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,324
Whatever you need, any time,
night or day, you just stop on by.

284
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,495
You want me to drive to
your house if I need paper?

285
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,205
Maybe you just want
someone to talk to,

286
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,000
maybe you need a place
to crash for a couple of days.

287
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,003
My wireless password
is "eat, pray, love."

288
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,671
Easy to remember.

289
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,384
Ready? Go, go, go!

290
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,030
You all right?
Yeah.

291
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,587
Dwight, what are you doing?

292
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,671
Shh.

293
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,886
Go! Go! Take the stairs, now!
What are you talking about?

294
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,055
Just run! Take the stairs! I don't
even know where the stairs are.

295
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,765
I'll stall him. Go!

296
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,977
What are you doing?

297
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,397
I'm going to activate
the seismic fail-safe.

298
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,233
We'll be stuck
between floors for hours.

299
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,446
Oh!

300
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,575
My pants fell down.
What?

301
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,411
My pants fell down!
I don't have a belt!

302
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,916
Hello, sir, good day. Dwight K.
Schrute, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

303
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,292
Forgive my pants,
they fell down.

304
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753
An appointment with Mr. Ramish,
please. Right now is fine.

305
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,255
No, no, no. I was here first. Dwight
K. Schrute, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

306
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,507
Hi, guys. What's going on?

307
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,593
Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone,
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.

308
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,595
I was here first. Sorry
about this mix-up. Okay.

309
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,639
I already made an
appointment with your secretary.

310
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,932
Let me stop you
all right here.

311
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,266
I've already picked
a new paper supplier.

312
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,768
Wait, it's not
DM Utica, is it?

313
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,397
No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all,
actually. It's Big Red Paper Company.

314
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,941
Big Red Paper Company?

315
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,025
Mmm-hmm.

316
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,028
Yes, yes, yes!

317
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,241
Get me a cup of coffee.

318
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,325
Me too.

319
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,202
Or do you also have
a monopoly on thirst?

320
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,204
All right, guys, it didn't
work out for any of us,

321
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,248
so we're still
on the same team.

322
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
Let me get these.
No.

323
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,545
Let him get his own.
He's got Syracuse money.

324
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,840
You know your partner's got
a lot of attitude, but I like that.

325
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,550
How long you guys
been dating?

326
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,510
Jim couldn't land me
in a thousand years.

327
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,719
But you're saying
there's a chance.

328
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,971
Shut up.

329
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,808
Hey.

330
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,062
I stole Nellie's phone.

331
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,898
Excellent. Excellent.

332
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,361
Though troubling that
your first instinct is thievery.

333
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,445
What do you want from me?

334
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,575
Now we get to the bottom of
Nellie's, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, never."

335
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,285
Hello, Nell, it's Mum.

336
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,496
Do keep your chin up. It can't
possibly be as bad as you describe.

337
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,914
Oh, yes, it can.

338
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,170
This is MasterCard.
You are over the limit.

339
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,214
Send the minimum
payment of $448 by Monday,

340
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,508
or we will be forced to
send it to collections.

341
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,718
Shopaholic.

342
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,012
Sounds like it.
Yeah.

343
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,557
Hi, sis. Is your boss
still hitting on you?

344
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,812
This is Annie
from Second Nests.

345
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,857
I'm sorry, but the Romanian
orphanage felt more comfortable

346
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,735
with a two-person nuclear
family than a single mother,

347
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,778
SO we're going to hold out
for that. Okay, that's enough.

348
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,530
No, no, no. Pam, we need
to get to the bottom of this.

349
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,865
No. No.
Come on. Come on.

350
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,785
Robert, okay... So, I deleted
them all. They're all deleted.

351
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,580
Pam, you've
completely bungled this.

352
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:20,915
Ah...

353
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,213
Hey.

354
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,385
Can I do it, Pam? Can I pull
off a gold Arabian sandal?

355
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
Um...

356
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,307
Yes. Definitely.
With your hair, certainly.

357
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,726
You dropped
your cell phone.

358
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,061
Oh, gosh.
Yep.

359
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,605
Thank you. I'm so stupid.

360
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,940
No. My goodness,
you just...

361
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,692
You have a lot going on
with Robert and everything.

362
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,445
Oh, God,
Pam, don't get me started.

363
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,863
No, I will not.

364
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,031
You've just got me started.

365
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,118
Robert is a filthy beast.

366
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,123
Don't you get the feeling
every time he looks at you,

367
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,668
he's just thinking of 15
different ways to do you?

368
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,961
Well...

369
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,838
The man talks of
nothing but sex.

370
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,342
Sometimes he talks about
flesh and bacchanals.

371
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,426
Oh, yeah.

372
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,180
I cannot even tell you what
he left on my phone last night.

373
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,433
No. Don't. Just put
it out of your mind.

374
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,022
Pam, what is your address?

375
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,942
I'm going to send you a pair
of these gold harem shoes.

376
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,528
Oh. No, you don't...
Yes.

377
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,739
Come on, a little
gold Arabian slipper.

378
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,158
Things are looking up.

379
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,869
I might be a mother soon.

380
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,624
I have MasterCard
right where I want them,

381
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,961
and I have a new friend.

382
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,131
A friend.

383
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,800
At work.

384
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,763
Erin.

385
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,181
There's a call
for you on line 1.

386
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,142
Who is it?

387
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,644
He says, "Salvation."
No last name.

388
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,816
Yeah, hello.

389
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,485
You once put me on a list
of the losers in the office.

390
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,071
This loser just got
your biggest client

391
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,906
to give him all
their business.

392
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,701
So, hire me back,
that business is yours.

393
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,329
Don't, and I will
find another buyer.

394
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,913
You're blackmailing me.

395
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,999
It's just business.

396
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,795
I will not be blackmailed by
some ineffectual, privileged,

397
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,006
effete, soft-penised debutant.

398
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,258
You want to start a street
fight with me, bring it on,

399
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,510
but you're going to be
surprised by how ugly it gets.

400
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,264
You don't even know my real
name. I'm the Lizard King.

401
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,728
Whoa.

402
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,818
Well, I gave him a chance.

403
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
Andy Bernard?

404
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,121
You got a minute?

405
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,624
I'm in the middle
of a piano lesson.

406
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,628
I wanted to see if could
interest you in an investment,

407
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,754
Dunder Mifflin.

408
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,966
Dunder Mifflin.
Now, why would I want that?

409
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,010
It's worth half what
it was three years ago.

410
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,303
Exactly.

411
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,806
And you know better than anyone
that with the right management,

412
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,434
it could be worth twice what
you would pay for it today.

413
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,273
Why don't you come in?

414
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,409
So, what would you do if you
weren't selling paper?

415
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,285
Oh, man,
I'd have to sell beets,

416
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,703
probably submit
them for competition.

417
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,038
What?

418
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,248
Yeah, I know it
sounds stupid,

419
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,417
but nationals has always
kind of been a dream of mine.

420
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,419
How have we never
talked about this before?

421
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,673
Wait, you don't even
care about nationals.

422
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,884
Nothing?

423
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,762
I don't know. I've always
wanted to own a bike shop, but...

424
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,389
What about you?

425
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,517
I'd like to sell one
big thing, you know?

426
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,436
Like a plane.

427
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,521
One sale. I'm out.

428
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,399
That sounds lovely.

429
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,152
Anyway, Robert's going to run
this company into the ground,

430
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,865
so we won't be doing
this in six months.
