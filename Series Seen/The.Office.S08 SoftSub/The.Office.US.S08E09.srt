1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,921
Oops. A little help.

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,010
Wow, your hair
is really thinning.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,014
Standing is proven to be
healthier, increases productivity

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,390
and just looks cooler.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,268
Picture someone
doing something heroic.

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,604
Now, was he sitting
or standing?

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,772
Not counting FDR.

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,525
Every second you sit there
is an hour off your life.

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,444
Look at all of you.

10
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,571
I feel like you're
in a suicide cult.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,365
No, no, no. You're
way off on that one.

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,492
Are you really
comfortable standing there?

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,704
I tried one of those, and I just
couldn't find the sweet spot.

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,669
Hey, guys, let's just all admit
it, okay? Dwight's better than us.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,088
He had the guts
to stop sitting,

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,883
and he's never, ever
gonna go back on it, right?

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,426
That's right, Jim.

18
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,812
Hey, man.

19
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,940
Taking a
load off, huh?

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,608
No. Putting a
load on, more like.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,984
Good luck with that.

22
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,444
Last thing I need is luck.

23
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,035
Thank you so much.

24
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,720
What are you up to?
Oh, look out.

25
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,888
Just... What are you doing?

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,098
Think fast. Ha ha!

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,183
Give that back. Come on. Prank!

28
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,602
That's real creative.

29
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,853
You know what, you're
right. It's not my best.

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,146
"Cause you could
easily just bend over

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,273
and pick that up,
right?

32
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,233
I could. I just don't
feel like it, loser.

33
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,442
Because you're sitting?
Standing.

34
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,027
Okay.
Don't!

35
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,696
Because you're sitting?
Standing.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,364
You know
I have to do this.

37
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,491
I know.

38
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,575
Whoa!

39
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,893
Andrew Baines Bernard.

40
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,812
I think you could
just do Andy Bernard.

41
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,315
Andrew Baines Bernard.
I love filling

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,900
these out 'cause it's like,
Oh, I'm taking a test,

43
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,527
but I know the answers.

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,282
In four seconds, my wife is going
to be coming through that door.

45
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,491
I told her she
could work here.

46
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,328
Under no circumstances
can that be allowed to happen.

47
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,956
There you are, honey.

48
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,125
How on earth did
you miss the elevator?

49
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,168
What was that?

50
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,669
I don't know.
He wasn't talking to me.

51
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,255
But if I were you,
I wouldn't hire his wife.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,175
That's why my foundation,

53
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,384
the Dream For
A Wish Foundation,

54
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,635
is gonna put them
out of business.

55
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,055
They're not gonna know what
hit them.

56
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,266
Everyone, I'd like
to introduce my wife,

57
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,851
Mrs. Robert California.

58
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,145
Mrs. California,
this is everyone.

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,271
Hello.
Hi.

60
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,357
Welcome.
Call me Susan, please.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,860
Last night at dinner,
Susan and I were talking

62
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,487
about her returning
to work.

63
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,199
So she's here today
to see if there's a good fit.

64
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,659
Something tells me it
just might work out.

65
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,872
This is Andy Bernard,
the regional manager.

66
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,040
Hello. Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,208
Hey there.
It's a pleasure. Welcome.

68
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,292
Thank you.

69
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,919
Andy, would you
be so kind

70
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,712
as to show Susan
around the office,

71
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,798
introduce her to
various departments,

72
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,133
find a place
where she'll shine?

73
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,053
I would love to,
but I have to be

74
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,596
completely honest
with you guys.

75
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,556
We're 100% staffed up.

76
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,813
Andy, let's see if there's a
good fit first, then we'll talk.

77
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,276
All right.

78
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,570
Knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock

79
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,447
You don't have to say
it if you're doing it.

80
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,574
Remember how you said

81
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,910
that you were looking
for a place in the office

82
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,329
to do calisthenics
and aerobics?

83
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,998
Ah, weightlifting, yeah.

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,417
Well, today's
your lucky day.

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,710
I have opened,
in this very office building,

86
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,088
Dwight Schrute's
Gym for Muscles.

87
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,173
Want to take a look?
I'll take a look.

88
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,177
Your path from
obesity begins right here.

89
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,099
I've been meaning to
join a gym. For my health.

90
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,519
I used to say I wanted to live long
enough to see a black president.

91
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,354
I didn't realize how
easy that would be.

92
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,730
So now I want to
live long enough

93
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,316
to see a really,
really gay president

94
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,693
or a supermodel president.

95
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,571
I want to see all the
different kinds of presidents.

96
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,866
Obese people in my office
building are a drain on resources.

97
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,576
Chairs wear out faster.

98
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,536
It takes more freon
to keep them cool.

99
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,204
They flush the
toilets more often.

100
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,166
Plus, their massive BMs
bust the rivets on my pipes.

101
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,212
But a gym turns
fat into cash.

102
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,175
All right, the DM
Express is pulling out.

103
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,885
All right, well, it was really
nice to meet you, Brian.

104
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,136
Ah, it's actually Ryan.

105
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,554
Oh, Ryan.
Yeah.

106
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,556
Bitch.

107
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,601
We will start
here at Erinville.

108
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,685
Hi.

109
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,228
Reception.

110
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,938
Your classic
one-man operation.

111
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,648
Although, I was
watching a movie,

112
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,400
and Meryl Streep
had two secretaries.

113
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,445
I was watching a movie, and a
bunch of apes took over San Francisco.

114
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,821
Just saying.

115
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,408
Two secretaries could convey
a sense of importance

116
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,118
and success to our clients.

117
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,622
Certainly worth exploring.
Wouldn't you agree, Andy?

118
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
I'll explore exploring
it. - Good.

119
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
Seems like you have
this under control,

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,505
so I'll just duck out and
run the company for a while.

121
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,589
Okay.

122
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,513
Okay, next stop
on the tour, sales.

123
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,849
Here we go. Station
stop, Jim Halpert.

124
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,935
Oh, boy, our resident
truth teller. Uh...

125
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,561
All right, have at it.
Let her rip.

126
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,104
What do you hate
about this place?

127
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,650
Well, it's sales,
SO you have to be able

128
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,777
to live in the
world of rejection.

129
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,362
Maybe you do.

130
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,947
Hi, I'm Dwight.

131
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,742
Sales is really not so
hard, okay. It's paper.

132
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,536
We have it,
and they want it so bad

133
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,120
they are willing
to pay for it.

134
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,288
Jim?

135
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,624
Well, it's not that easy.

136
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,209
It's kind of
sometimes difficult.

137
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,711
It's the second-easiest
job in the world.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,672
Being a mom.
I love shopping.

139
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,132
And sales is just
the other side of that.

140
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,093
That's true.

141
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,138
You know, if you joined
our sales department,

142
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,099
you would be working
very closely with our

143
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,101
department head,
Mr. Dwight Schrute.

144
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,185
That's me.

145
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,230
Dwight, why don't you tell
Susan about some of your hobbies.

146
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,399
Oh... Mmm-hmm. Survival skills.

147
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,234
Ranking of animals.

148
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,777
Maybe over a beer

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,822
after she's closed her first
sale.

150
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,535
Well, make that a red wine and
I'll tell you my animal rankings.

151
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,124
How am I
supposed to pull this off?

152
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,752
The entire office is being nicer to
her than they've ever been to me.

153
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,462
What I wouldn't give
for one of Phyllis'

154
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,339
classic room-clearing
farts right now.

155
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,842
Ready?

156
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,139
What do you think?
Huh?

157
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,849
Umm, no.

158
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,100
No. This is not a gym.

159
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,810
This is like a
scene out of Saw V.

160
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,353
You haven't even
looked around yet.

161
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,605
Look.

162
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,982
Gravel bucket squat yoke.

163
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,195
Right?

164
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
Hmm.

165
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,866
Dedicated phone
book ripping station.

166
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,287
You ever cut tin before? No.

167
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,540
Five yards in and your
forearms will be on fire.

168
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,292
Plus, I will buy
the tin back from you

169
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,002
that you cut for
two cents a yard.

170
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,130
Now, let's go
over membership.

171
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,882
I'm gonna need
the first month's

172
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,301
and the last month's
up front for $49 a month.

173
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,346
But every third
month is $59 a month.

174
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,058
But the fourth month is a
discount month at $19 per month.

175
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,644
Obviously, you know
how a gym works.

176
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,188
So you know I'm not
gonna pay money for this.

177
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,939
You want people to
come to your gym?

178
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,900
Make a real gym.

179
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,568
Darryl.

180
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,697
Make a real gym.

181
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,575
I was thinking accounting
might be a good fit

182
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,035
because I really
clicked with Oscar,

183
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,704
and I do have some
experience with bookkeeping.

184
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,249
But we already have a
surplus of accountants as it is.

185
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,920
I would work in customer
service, um, HR, even.

186
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,838
Those are fully
staffed as well.

187
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,509
Are you telling me that there's
no one in this entire office

188
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,095
that could use
an extra pair of hands?

189
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,013
Yes.

190
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:39,268
I am the CEO, and I am telling
an employee of mine what to do.

191
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,647
Let me beat around
the bush for a second.

192
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,859
Our chairman of the board has
some very strong feelings...

193
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,696
Robert, it's all right.
This is very uncomfortable.

194
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,825
Obviously, there's no place for
me here, so thank you for trying.

195
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,909
Why don't we
just let it go?

196
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
No.
Absolutely not.

197
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,579
Andrew, there must be
something you can do.

198
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,997
There must be. Think.

199
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,918
Well, there are
a lot of considerations.

200
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,630
I would be eternally grateful.

201
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,635
It's not a bad thing
to have the CEO owe you one.

202
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,308
All right!
Well, then, welcome aboard.

203
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,818
So what happens next?

204
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,448
We get you over to HR and then
get you set up with accounting.

205
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,783
Hang on.

206
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,869
- Hello?
- Say "hello, grandma.”

207
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,330
Hi, gam-gam.

208
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,041
Hold one finger up
to Susan. You'll just be a second.

209
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,878
You numbskull!

210
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,504
You were given
a very simple task.

211
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
I could not have been
more clear with you.

212
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,925
Now say, "Are you
taking your medicine?"

213
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,219
Are you taking your med-meds?

214
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,222
Why can you not say
exactly what I tell you?

215
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,434
Undo this. Undo it.

216
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,190
You didn't say good-bye
to your grandmother.

217
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,817
We promised we'd
never say good-bye.

218
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,158
Attention! I am
now accepting memberships

219
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,452
for the Dwight Schrute
Gym for Muscles.

220
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,621
First 20 members
can take advantage

221
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,790
of our "pay what
you weigh" promotion.

222
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,416
All I need
is another gym.

223
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,751
As if I don't
have enough drama.

224
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,670
We have a gym at home.
It's called the bedroom.

225
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,880
Who's spotting who?

226
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,381
"Don't use the bike
in the corner,

227
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,925
"that's Bruce's.
Jeremy says..."

228
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,343
Enough. Oscar, enough.

229
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,928
Kelly?
I have these sneakers,

230
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,472
which are basically just
like a gym for your feet, so...

231
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,769
That's okay. I know
how to build a business.

232
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,562
You gotta bet the
black people to do it

233
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,189
to get the white
people to do it.

234
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,733
Then you gotta get the
black people to stop doing it.

235
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,735
One step at a time.

236
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,904
Did you bring your
passport with you?

237
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,739
Who walks around
with their passport?

238
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,824
Well, I do.

239
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,991
Always ready
for adventure.

240
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,451
Have you had any?

241
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,702
No.

242
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,750
Hey, guys.

243
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,254
So Robert doesn't want
his wife working here.

244
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,840
So now that she is,
we have to drive her away.

245
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,052
Andy, if he didn't want her working
here, then why did you hire her?

246
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,347
Oscar, it was a mistake.

247
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,268
But one that can be fixed
by all of us being mean to her.

248
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,771
How can we do that?
She's simply wonderful.

249
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,147
This is all pathetic.

250
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,942
I am not asking,
I am ordering.

251
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,194
How mean are
we talking about?

252
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,445
It would be great if
she were gone by lunch.

253
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,907
Erin, you're up. Find her a place
to work, but not too comfortable.

254
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,410
Got it. I know exactly
which stapler to give her.

255
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,291
Here you go.

256
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,379
Um, do you think it
would be possible

257
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,964
to move to that
desk over there?

258
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,217
Because this seems a bit cramped,
and I don't have a computer.

259
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,719
Well, that's a sales desk.

260
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,597
Yeah. You need to be over
here with us accountants.

261
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,141
Just sit here
and be quiet.

262
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,311
And if you have a question,
just raise your hand.

263
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,732
But I'm gonna save you some time,
sweetie, and give you the answer now.

264
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,694
I don't know.

265
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,072
No, I don't think
we should be trying

266
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,616
to make this
place seem unpleasant.

267
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,242
I think we should
let this place

268
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,744
just crush her
spirit by itself.

269
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,454
I mean, it knows
what it's doing.

270
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,331
That's Gerald.

271
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,833
Oh, wow. So cute.

272
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,418
Oh, that is so cute.

273
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,672
Oh, he's so tiny.
Is he in a ladle?

274
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,924
Yeah, he's in a ladle.

275
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,259
That's adorable. How on
earth did you get him in a ladle?

276
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,552
He did it himself.

277
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,179
Is that ladle
stainless or...

278
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,472
Oh, stainless.
Williams Sonoma.

279
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,016
Excuse me, waiter,
there's a dog in my soup.

280
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,976
It's
not that kind of ladle.

281
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,103
Very cute.
Let me see.

282
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,230
Just the battery
on these things.

283
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,107
I'm sorry,
I've gotta recharge this.

284
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,111
I get it.
Last time I had a job,

285
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,113
I remember I hated
the boss' wife.

286
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,533
Of course, she was
married to Robert.

287
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,373
Your employees don't
seem to be taking to me.

288
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,042
Andy!

289
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,713
Andy, could you
step in here, please?

290
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,049
We'll fix this.

291
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,468
What is going on?

292
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,678
Please.

293
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,931
Ah, Andrew, my wife

294
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,727
has brought up an issue
that requires your attention.

295
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,899
So, if you'll excuse me,
I should step out,

296
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:42,071
get to the ATM before that homeless
man sets up camp for the night.

297
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,787
Okey-dokey, artichokey.

298
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,873
You hate it, don't you?

299
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,083
Do you not want me here?

300
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,377
Why would you say that?
It's okay.

301
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,337
I understand. I'm not
sure how I would feel

302
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,339
about having the boss'
wife work for me either.

303
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,258
It's not that exactly.

304
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,634
But it is something.

305
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,138
Let's just say that if you
don't want to work here,

306
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,973
I am totally
prepared to respect that.

307
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,933
Why would you not
want me working here?

308
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,476
I don't know.

309
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,772
I think I understand
what you're going through.

310
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,694
My husband can be a very
difficult man to read, can't he?

311
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,820
Yes!

312
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,115
The dude is an enigma.

313
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,367
So he is mixed up
in this, isn't he?

314
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,496
Got it.

315
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,959
What do you
think you're doing?

316
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,294
Getting my sweat on.

317
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,671
I build you this
temple to the human body,

318
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,882
and you're lifting
what, five pounds?

319
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,884
I just did, like,
35 minutes on the treadmill.

320
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,219
I was watching you. You want
to know how long it really was?

321
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,763
Eight minutes!
No.

322
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,890
Dude, I'm gonna be
here all week, right?

323
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,601
Five days a week.
I figure I'll start slow.

324
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,353
Is that the same philosophy
you apply to buffalo wings?

325
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,693
I want you to bring that same
buffalo wing passion to this gym!

326
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,488
I'm gonna make you
look like Lebron James!

327
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,615
It's Lejon Brames.

328
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,450
That's what I said.
Yeah.

329
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,452
Get it right.
I know.

330
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,661
Cameras...

331
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,747
Still here. Terrific.

332
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,084
Andy and I had
a great conversation.

333
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,670
And I just want
to let you know

334
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,048
that I am not going
to be working here.

335
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,676
Well, that's a shame.

336
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,720
It just was one of
those things... Is it?

337
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,014
Because we
talked about it,

338
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,016
and it seems like that
might be what you want.

339
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,893
Which is fine.
Where did this come from?

340
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,103
Did Andy say that?

341
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,354
No, he did not.

342
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,730
But I could tell
he was struggling

343
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,065
to understand what
was expected of him.

344
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,527
What's the struggle? He made
a great call, hired a great person.

345
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
You sure about that?

346
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,114
Absolutely.
No games?

347
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,532
No games.

348
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,867
Because Andy seemed to
think there was some information

349
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,577
he was not able
to share with me.

350
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,204
Enough of this. I
mean, real... Enough.

351
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,374
It's gotten way out of hand.
Andrew, this is my wife.

352
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,878
Whatever privacy you were trying
to protect between us, I thank you for.

353
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,297
But it is not
welcome right now.

354
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,383
Just be honest.

355
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,054
Andy...
Yes.

356
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,722
Why do you keep
looking at my husband?

357
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,349
Andy, just answer
the question.

358
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,600
No games?

359
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,768
No games.

360
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,229
Okay.

361
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,982
I mean, it was kind
of funny, actually.

362
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,817
Robert storms in,
and he says,

363
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,235
"In four seconds,
my wife's gonna be in here.

364
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,486
"I told her she
could work here.

365
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,780
"Under no circumstances
can that be allowed to happen."

366
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,490
You lying son of a bitch!

367
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,329
Tell my wife you're lying.

368
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,458
I am lying.
I am a compulsive liar.

369
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,501
That's not true, is it?

370
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,086
No, it's not.

371
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,881
I tell the truth
most of the time,

372
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,091
and I was just telling the
truth about your husband.

373
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,634
Jim knows. He was there.

374
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,178
This is preposterous.

375
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,096
Robert...
Let's get Jim in here.

376
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,808
Where's Jim?

377
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,727
He just rolled out
and crawled out.

378
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,147
Can you call security, tell
them to keep an eye out for him?

379
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,899
Time to settle this.

380
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,985
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

381
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,278
I just need to get through.

382
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,615
Just real quick.
Real quick, open... Okay.

383
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,830
That's weird.

384
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,625
Well, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

385
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,969
Ow! Ow!

386
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
Ow!

387
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,646
Creed, I was
never here, all right?

388
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,106
Okay. What about
your friend?

389
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,151
Oh, boy.

390
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,992
This is my gym, my rules. You do
exactly as I say, no questions asked.

391
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,911
Yeah, I'm gonna
ask questions,

392
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,496
and I might not
do what you say.

393
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,290
First thing, we're gonna
stretch the pelvic bowl.

394
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,126
Ready? Get down on the floor.

395
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,962
Okay, I'm not doing that.

396
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,381
Really?

397
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,174
Too embarrassing
for you? Huh?

398
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,094
You wish that every exercise was
strutting around the gym like the Fonz?

399
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,346
Well, how do you think
the Fonz got so cool?

400
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,640
He stretched
his pelvic bowl.

401
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,602
I didn't know
Darryl joined.

402
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,853
Looks that way.

403
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,356
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.

404
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,527
Hello, Jim.

405
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,861
No, no. No, no, no!

406
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,697
Don't. Damn it, Tuna!

407
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,242
So, I think you know
what we want to know.

408
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,743
Do 1?
Yes.

409
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,078
I know. I do.

410
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,040
Jim, I've had enough
of your unhelpfulness.

411
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,750
I really wish I could help.

412
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,294
I'm not really sure how I can.

413
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,337
For God's sake,
did Robert tell you

414
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,423
that he didn't
want me working here?

415
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
That's the thing.

416
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,677
See, I didn't want to get in
the middle of this. Still don't.

417
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,013
But here's something.

418
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,266
I feel that maybe,
if we take a step back,

419
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,937
this is a simple case of
anxiety to work with a spouse.

420
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,648
I think we've
got ourselves an answer.

421
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,775
That makes
complete sense, right? No...

422
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,569
Thank you all for a
wonderful day. Perfect!

423
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,987
Yes? Jim...

424
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,113
Answer the question,
please.

425
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,951
I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

426
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,662
To be really honest,
my wife works here.

427
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,289
And I love it.

428
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,333
She literally
makes me work harder.

429
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,127
She makes me smarter. She
makes me remember why I'm here.

430
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,256
And between us, she's on
maternity leave right now,

431
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,592
and I would love to leave
this room and see her face.

432
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,261
I would love it.
I don't know how this helps,

433
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,429
but it's just
what I'm thinking.

434
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,722
All right. Thanks.

435
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,515
Yes. All right.

436
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,065
Uh...

437
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,149
Yeah.

438
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,233
Yeah.

439
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,908
Thank you.

440
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,668
Andy.

441
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,088
Hey, Mrs. California.

442
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,967
Hey. I'm sorry about the
position you were put in today.

443
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,512
You know, honestly, we
all wanted you to work there.

444
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,306
Except for him.
Especially me.

445
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,850
Yes, I thought we
really hit it off.

446
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,102
Yeah.

447
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,145
Well, different circumstances.

448
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,397
Yeah.

449
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,856
Who knows?
Who knows?

450
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,275
Maybe after all
this settles down...

451
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,777
Totally.

452
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,238
It's a date.

453
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,322
Hmm?

454
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,076
You're nothing!
You're so weak!

455
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,161
You call yourself
a man? Huh?

456
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,455
This doesn't help me. I don't
respond to that kind of strategy.

457
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,581
Okay, fine.

458
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,918
Finish your set on your own, and
never come back to my gym again!

459
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,379
Dwight, come back and spot me.

460
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,507
All right, I'll help you.

461
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,802
But first, you gotta
tell me what your goal is.

462
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,886
What do you want?

463
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,012
To push this bar up.

464
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,141
No! Because if that was the
case, the bar would be up by now.

465
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,434
What is your goal?

466
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,685
Help me!

467
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,562
What do you want?

468
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,355
To look good for Val!

469
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,190
Val Kilmer?

470
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,484
I don't buy it,
that doesn't make any sense.

471
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,404
Wow.

472
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,531
I figured out your goal.

473
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,244
I am gonna make you the buffest
dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
