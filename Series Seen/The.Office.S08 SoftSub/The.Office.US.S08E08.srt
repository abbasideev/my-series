1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,379
The Sabre Code of Conduct
outlines the governing principles

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:08,967
key to establishing and maintaining
trust with our employees, clients...

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,719
Oh, my God, kill me.

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,972
Hey. All right, obviously,
we all want to die,

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:18,852
but we have to get through
this, so Gabe, go ahead. It's okay.

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,313
Oh, is it...
Is it okay with you?

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,565
Because if it's not,
you work for me, so...

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,150
Comply with all
applicable laws,

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,610
regulations,
policies and contracts

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,777
governing our business.

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,196
Be honest, fair...
I'm going to do it.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,282
...trustworthy in all your business
activities and relationships.

13
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,202
Treat one another...
Oh! I'm going into labor!

14
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,078
Okay. She's going into labor!
Oh, my goodness.

15
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,163
Make way, everybody!

16
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,498
I know it's wrong to
fake going into labor

17
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,667
just to get out of things,
but sometimes,

18
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,919
it's necessary.

19
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm going into labor.

20
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,047
But should I
have corn dogs or...

21
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,757
I'm going into labor!

22
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,800
Okay, three reasons you
are wrong about True Blood.

23
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,136
Number one...
I'm going into labor.

24
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,182
Here we go!

25
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,393
Hey, guys, you can't keep
saying you're going into labor.

26
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,561
Everyone knows
you're full of it.

27
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,063
Yeah. OSCAR:
It's not fair, you guys.

28
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,147
- Pitiful.
- So stupid.

29
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,982
Never cry wolf.

30
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,859
Okay.
Okay.

31
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,196
Oh. Oh! Oh, my gosh!

32
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,240
Oh, my God, Pam!

33
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,951
I'm really in labor!
This is happening.

34
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,285
Okay, guys.
Okay.

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,578
Here we go.
We'll see you.

36
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,330
How do you feel?

37
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,957
Drive carefully!
Good luck!

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,708
- Bye!
- Good luck!

39
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,714
False alarm.

40
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,031
What? They took
another client from us?

41
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,700
Okay, bye.

42
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,746
Man, business is war.

43
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,500
Customers, clients,
it's like a war out there.

44
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,544
I am a leader,

45
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:12,007
but you can only inspire people
so much in a place like this.

46
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,219
So today, I'm turning
the inspire factor up to 10.

47
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,015
With a little help from my
friend, America's bloodiest battle.

48
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,270
Why even read business books?
We should be studying war.

49
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,564
Going to places like
Gettysburg. Where is that?

50
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,898
It's right here in PA.

51
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,276
Ah!

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,239
Well, we should take a field trip
there. I mean, that would be so cool.

53
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,699
I wonder if that
bus downstairs is...

54
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,410
Okay, Andy. We get it.
It's a trip to Gettysburg.

55
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,079
That sounds super inspiring!
I'm in!

56
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,914
Gettysburg? Hmm.
Could be interesting.

57
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,833
Second most northern
battle in the Civil War.

58
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,627
Actually, it is
the northernmost.

59
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,004
Hal

60
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,423
The Civil War history industry

61
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,177
has conveniently forgotten
about the Battle of Schrute Farms.

62
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,765
Whatever. I'm over
it. It's just grossly irresponsible.

63
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,767
Charge!

64
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,935
Well, this could be fun.

65
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,438
Yeah, well, the bus
has free Wi-Fi,

66
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,275
and I made special low
sugar lunches for everyone.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,694
And is anyone
kosher or halal?

68
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,737
What's the halal option?

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,615
Dates, tabouleh
and bagel with cream cheese.

70
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,741
Out.

71
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,578
You know, it's the same as the
kosher option. There's a lesson in there.

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,831
I mean, I can't force you
to go, you're not my slaves.

73
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,708
Thanks to Gettysburg.

74
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,251
But who's coming with me?

75
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,379
I'm in.
I'm in, too.

76
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,133
I guess I'm a sucker
for historical fiction.

77
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,386
Anyone who's not going,
you're dead to me.

78
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,471
You're uninvited.
I don't want you to come.

79
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,015
But FYI,
there will be leftover

80
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,892
turkey and pesto
sammies in the fridge.

81
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:46,976
Yes!

82
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,062
One for you.
Cool, thanks.

83
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,355
And one for you.

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,731
Cool, thanks.

85
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,193
Oh! You missed your head.
There you go.

86
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,569
Phyllis, think fast!

87
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,366
All right, guys, a little
foreplay before we do it.

88
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,745
Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will
most certainly enjoy The Civil War.

89
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,372
You know, I just got
Limitless on my iPad.

90
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,082
I bet I could
get it on the TV.

91
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,335
Oh, isn't that the one where
the guy becomes limitless?

92
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,422
It's just not appropriate. If we were
going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace,

93
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,340
I'd be the first one suggesting
that. I'd be rooting for it...

94
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,802
Limitless, Limitless,
Limitless, Limitless, Limitless!

95
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,303
All right,
all right, all right!

96
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,348
Here.

97
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
Like it? KEVIN:
Oh, by the picnic table?

98
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,352
Then you've got to
get the fire pit.

99
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,938
I can't get a fire pit,
I have two babies.

100
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,731
But the fire pit is
a no-brainer. Oh, hi there.

101
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,194
Hi, Robert. Hey. Um, how are
you doing? Good to see you again.

102
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,530
Where is everyone?
Where is Andy?

103
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,865
Andy took some of
the other people

104
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,324
on a corporate
retreat to Gettysburg.

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,580
Well, I was hoping to talk
out some ideas with Andy.

106
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,545
But what we have
here is perhaps better.

107
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,840
By not going on the trip,
you've shown

108
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,217
you're the free
thinkers of the office.

109
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,304
Robert, you've got your sheep,
and you got your black sheep.

110
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,098
And I'm not even a sheep.
I am on the freaking moon.

111
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,227
So, here's what we can do.

112
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,937
Game changers.

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,815
Changes to the game,
such that the game

114
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,318
can never be played
the same way again.

115
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,155
Everyone,
brainstorm some innovations.

116
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,492
Don't be afraid to
get weird with it.

117
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,077
Meredith!

118
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,539
Excited.

119
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,919
Okay.

120
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,974
You guys, get excited!

121
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
Movie's almost over.

122
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,481
All right, we're here.
Limitless can wait.

123
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,693
Fun fact. In France,
they call Limitless

124
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,737
"The Man with
Many Capabilities."

125
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,951
Whoo-hoo! Ladies and
gentlemen, the 1800s await you.

126
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,162
We can watch
Limitless on the way back.

127
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,122
I got Source Code
on the way back.

128
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,167
Whoo!

129
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,504
Where are you going?

130
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,216
Visitors' Center. Going to grab
a map for the memorials, right?

131
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,218
We're not going to the Visitors'
Center. We're not tourists.

132
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,761
No, of course
we're not tourists.

133
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,055
We're just people that aren't
from here who are taking a tour.

134
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,474
Yeah, the sign says,
"Begin tour here."

135
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,061
Unless you're going on
the very specially created

136
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,730
and meticulously researched
Andy Bernard Tour.

137
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,650
After Chancellorsville,

138
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,862
Lee brought his army up the
Shenandoah Valley, right through here.

139
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:49,200
They stopped in this field for a
picnic, which they called "lunch."

140
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,952
Yeah,
but I'm confused...

141
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,579
Total deaths
belongs to Gettysburg.

142
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,914
But when you're talking about
DPA, that's deaths per acre...

143
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,000
Uh-huh. ...nothing beats
the Battle of Schrute Farms.

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,752
Oh, DPA sounds way
more important... Oh, it is.

145
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,589
And you should read some of these
letters that the soldiers wrote home.

146
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,799
I mean, it makes
the Battle of Gettysburg

147
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,968
sound like a bunch of schoolgirls
wrestling over a hairbrush.

148
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:13,266
I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking,
too. So beautifully written.

149
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,184
Dwight, what are
you telling this girl?

150
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,561
The truth.

151
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,188
Stop filling her head with nonsense,
okay? She doesn't know any better.

152
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,190
Oscar, I'm so glad
you just got here.

153
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,775
I would have
believed everything he said.

154
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,028
No, no, no. You're filling
her head with nonsense.

155
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,530
You and the history books.
I'm telling the truth!

156
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,823
Interesting.

157
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,158
Yes, thank you.

158
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,535
All of history has
been whitewashed.

159
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,662
Really? Why don't you tell us
the real history, Gore Vidal?

160
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,998
Okay, I will.
I don't know who that is,

161
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,124
but I'm going
to tell you this.

162
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,167
He's a historian.

163
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,545
Gettysburg was very important.
Credit where credit is due, okay?

164
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,048
Big mad props to Gettysburg.

165
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,551
Was it, however, the most
northern battle of the Civil War?

166
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,094
Yes, yes...
Not by a long shot!

167
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,137
No!
Yes!

168
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,307
No, it was not! No, it
was not!

169
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,059
Was it the second
most northern?

170
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,393
What?

171
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,146
Sure! I would cede it was the
second most northern battle...

172
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,272
Erin!

173
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,316
Was it the northernmost?
No! Get out of here, Oscar...

174
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,400
Get out of here!

175
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:10,239
I am so eager to hear your game
changers. Let's dig in, shall we?

176
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,325
May I go first?
Absolutely.

177
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,289
Raw fish. The disgusting
food from Japan

178
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,041
that Americans
would never want to eat.

179
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,085
Now, we can't
get enough of it.

180
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,589
From movie stars to construction
workers, sushi is what's for dinner.

181
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:33,262
Let me throw another
idea at you. Origami. What?

182
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,558
The crazy art of paper
folding from, that's right, Japan.

183
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,269
Don't you wish you
could go back to 1980

184
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,147
and open the first sushi
restaurant in Manhattan?

185
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,733
We can do that with

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,446
origami,
it's the sushi of paper.

187
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,490
This idea hasn't gripped me.

188
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,867
What else did
you come up with?

189
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,953
I had to memorize
the presentation, Robert,

190
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,080
and it took a long time
to build the swan, so.

191
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,498
That was bad.

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,043
If your woman is like mine,

193
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,796
I bet you come home to hear
the same thing all the time.

194
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,258
"This paper is so hard.
It scratches.

195
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,052
"Why can't there be
a paper just for me?"

196
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,303
Well, now there is.

197
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,686
It's pink,
scented and silky soft.

198
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,982
Now, you can watch the game,
and she can write a letter to her sister.

199
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,903
The situation you described, returning
home to a wife complaining about

200
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,489
her paper being too masculine,
is not one that I'm familiar with.

201
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,826
In the African
American community.

202
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,829
Thought it was worth a try.

203
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,039
That's fascinating.

204
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,001
Tell me, what's the significance
of the peach orchard, though?

205
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,378
Well, that's a great question.
Actually, some of the most...

206
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,046
Excuse me,
I've got a question for you.

207
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,841
Can you tell us about
the Battle of Schrute Farms?

208
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,718
Oh, I haven't
heard of that one.

209
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,763
Really?
Okay, follow-up question,

210
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,514
how much are they paying you
to keep your mouth shut?

211
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,227
I apologize for my friend. And for the
Republicans who are cutting your funding.

212
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,229
We don't need to
bother this poor gentleman.

213
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,315
I know exactly where
we're going. Giddy-up!

214
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,526
Tallyho!

215
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,113
Are you Lincoln?

216
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,490
No, no, I'm...

217
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,203
Apparently, I bear a passing
resemblance to Abraham Lincoln.

218
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,788
It makes it kind of
hard for me to go to places

219
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,873
like museums,
historical monuments,

220
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,000
elementary schools.
I don't see it.

221
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,586
Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln
your hat so I can take a picture.

222
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,463
Okay, quick.

223
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,383
Hey, Lincoln's starting.

224
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,056
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm
actually with a tour group myself, so...

225
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,895
Hello, I'm Abraham Lincoln.

226
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,106
Some people call me
the "Great Emancipator,"”

227
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,234
but you might know
me from the penny.

228
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,988
Okay, you know
the test booklets

229
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,990
that they give out
in all the schools?

230
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,117
I was thinking that we could
put a coupon in the back

231
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,079
that people
would mail in to us.

232
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,123
And as, you know,
as I tell it, I don't like it.

233
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,877
Unless, of course, you are
responding to it. I am not.

234
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,088
Um, excuse me, I'm going
to go to the bathroom.

235
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,091
At this point,
when you're this pregnant,

236
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,260
it's kind of
like senior spring.

237
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,429
The other day, I spit my
gum out on the carpet.

238
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,057
Kevin. You've been quiet.

239
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,269
I'm curious to know
what your game changer is.

240
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,604
You know how
in the vending machine,

241
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,775
they have the chocolate
chip cookies in the A-1 spot?

242
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,360
They do that
because they think

243
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,612
A-1 is the best spot
for the best cookie.

244
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,616
But the real best spot is D-4.

245
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,785
Right? That's where
the eyes go.

246
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,121
So...

247
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,458
Cookies. Cookie placement.

248
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,420
Yeah. But not just
the cookies, though.

249
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,006
That was just a for instance.

250
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,592
Who else agrees with Kevin

251
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:02,471
that we're wasting facilities,
manpower on our underselling products,

252
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,808
when we should be pushing
our top performers?

253
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,736
There you get consensus.

254
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,613
Okay, we are
now on a planet where

255
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,115
Kevin is the most
creative person around

256
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,952
and I am just some
good looking guy.

257
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,538
I just don't understand.

258
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,666
It's 1865, victory is ours,

259
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,838
I have saved the very soul of our
nation and yet, happiness eludes me.

260
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,970
Oh, perhaps a trip to the
theater will enliven my spirits.

261
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,347
No!

262
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,018
So, another thing about oatmeal
cookies. Who even wants them?

263
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,897
I mean, I've seen
Toby eat one like once,

264
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,651
but other than that,
forget it.

265
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,527
Interesting.

266
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,825
So what is Dunder
Mifflin's oatmeal cookie?

267
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,912
What is the product
that no one wants?

268
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,374
How about that
two-hole punch letter?

269
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,252
Only the lawyers want that
punch at the top, and they use legal.

270
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,717
That's the oatmeal cookie.
Fantastic, Kevin, fantastic.

271
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,344
Thank you.

272
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,097
By the way, did we leave
all the food on the bus?

273
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,142
Let's talk about food for a
second. Food for thought.

274
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,811
Yeah, that's what I
had for breakfast,

275
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,521
and I think that's
probably why I'm still hungry.

276
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:38,859
Hunger. Hunger for victory.
Hunger for honor, hunger for pride.

277
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,569
Hunger for hamburgers.

278
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,279
Hunger for
chicken chimichangas.

279
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,489
Right, Darryl?
That's good.

280
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,077
Exactly. Now, do you know what
the Civil War soldiers were hungry for?

281
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,497
Pride. Now, each
battalion had its own flag,

282
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,332
and they guarded these
flags with their lives.

283
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,878
Colonel Harrison Jeffords
of the 4th Michigan Infantry

284
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,922
saw his flag
being carried away,

285
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,049
chased it down with
nothing but a sword,

286
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,304
fought tooth and nail at the
foot of that flag until he died.

287
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,598
He wasn't about to
let them have that flag.

288
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,977
Pride. Right, guys?

289
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,358
I commissioned this flag for
Dunder Mifflin. It cost me $200.

290
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,027
Only $2007?

291
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,823
We are all branches on this tree.
And from the tree comes paper.

292
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:30,327
We're all part of a business,
but business is war.

293
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,288
What's that I hear?

294
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:37,126
Oh! A rebel paper company
is coming to take our flag.

295
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,628
What's going on here?
Whee-hoo!

296
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,591
Come and get it! Who's going to get
the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa, hey!

297
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,469
Don't look where I am, look where
I'm going. Jerk right, jerk left, jerk...

298
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,846
Andy, this is inappropriate.
People died here, man.

299
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,016
Get the flag, get the flag!
Come on, Big Tuna.

300
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,518
What are you going to do about
it? We've got a flag right here!

301
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,603
Whee-hoo!

302
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,274
Spangler's Spring
is a mile this way.

303
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:05,654
Oh, wow. So, that's two miles
if you incorporate the walk back.

304
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,950
It's... I mean, come on.

305
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,286
Oh, I don't think I
should walk anymore.

306
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,622
All I had for
breakfast was oatmeal,

307
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,167
yogurt, coffee,
orange juice and toast.

308
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,587
Two poached eggs and then
that half a sandwich on the bus.

309
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,671
I can't.

310
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,423
All right, fine.
You know what?

311
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,841
I guess this place
just hasn't rubbed off

312
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,343
on you the way
that I hoped it would.

313
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:34,391
I'm still going, and I'm
not going to ask anymore.

314
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm not even
going to look back,

315
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,229
I'm just going to
assume that you're with me.

316
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,365
You said you weren't
going to look back.

317
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
And why is BlackRock

318
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:58,624
suddenly the paragon by which all
hedge funds must now be compared?

319
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,918
Yeah, I don't know.

320
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,629
Right? I mean,
you're an accountant,

321
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,674
those bogus prospectuses
must drive you insane.

322
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,220
Yes, I am an accountant.

323
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,141
Dwight, this is one
of the archivists here.

324
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,059
I thought maybe
we can consult him.

325
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,227
Really?
Yeah.

326
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,856
Well, anyone employed by the
Gettysburg industrial complex

327
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,524
is certainly going
to want to keep quiet

328
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
about the Battle
of Schrute Farms.

329
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,486
Schrute Farms, did you say?

330
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,823
That is a fascinating little
chapter of the Civil War.

331
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,991
You've heard about it?

332
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:36,453
Yes! Ha! Prepare to be
refuted. Go on, come on.

333
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,330
There you go.

334
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,834
Families
and sweethearts back home

335
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,295
waited desperately for
letters from the front.

336
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,091
"Dearest Mother, I'm sorry it
has been so long since my last letter.

337
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,760
“It is three months since I
arrived at Schrute Farms,

338
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:56,640
"and I fear I may never leave this
place alive. Melvyn Fifer Garris.”

339
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,642
Hallowed ground.

340
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,188
But the battle at
Schrute Farms was no battle at all.

341
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,816
It was a code used by pacifists
from both North and South,

342
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,359
who'd turned
the Pennsylvania farmhouse

343
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,738
into an artistic community
and a refuge from the war.

344
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,533
You have to understand,
poets, artists, dancers,

345
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,745
these kinds of men
preferred peace to war.

346
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,540
These delicate, lovely men
found a place of refuge

347
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,584
among the Schrutes
of Schrute Farm.

348
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,295
Amidst the macho
brutality of war,

349
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,883
this was a place where dandies
and dreamers could put on plays,

350
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,219
sing tender ballads
and dance in the moonlight.

351
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,473
I like to think of Schrute Farm
as the Underground Railroad

352
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,435
for the sensitive and,
well fabulous.

353
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,147
Wow, this is so much better
than the story you made up.

354
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,024
I've seen enough.

355
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,068
You're right, there should
be a monument to this.

356
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,155
Never trust a cookie
with a woman's name.

357
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:58,160
Pecan Sandy.
Lorna Doone. Madeleine.

358
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,370
Oh...

359
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,372
They'll just break your heart.

360
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,502
Kevin, you are...

361
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,089
Robert, I hate to interrupt, but I
would love to pitch you one last idea.

362
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,716
I call it the Big Mac idea.

363
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,301
What? No.

364
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,844
Big Mac idea.
Sounds encouraging.

365
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,305
It's really, really good,
Robert. Let me explain.

366
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,724
No, this is not fair.
This is my idea.

367
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,519
He's trying to steal it
because he's jealous of me.

368
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,438
Well, what is the idea?

369
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:31,193
Every time you buy a Big Mac,
you set one ingredient aside.

370
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:36,323
Then, at the end of the week,
you have a free Big Mac.

371
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,202
And you love it even more, because
you made it with your own hands.

372
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,957
You know what? Now I remember.
That was your idea.

373
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,543
That is 100% your idea.

374
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,839
Oh, my.

375
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,385
It was just actually
cookies the whole time.

376
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,056
Damn it.
Hey.

377
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,728
You guys came.
Where's everyone else?

378
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,522
Back at the bus.
We were locked out.

379
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,899
Phyllis is sitting on the
ground, eating a dirty sandwich.

380
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,402
Yeah, I asked
the bus driver to lock it

381
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,446
because our stuff was in
there. I guess he follows orders.

382
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,991
Yeah, sorry everybody else
didn't come. I think they're just tired.

383
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,577
With holes in their
shoes and their dysentery.

384
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,121
Even without an audience,
you're still at it.

385
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,622
What are you talking about?

386
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:30,085
Our office has a disease,
and it goes by many names.

387
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,381
Sarcasm, snark, "wisecracks."

388
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,508
You take things
that people care about,

389
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,845
and you make them feel
lame about it with your jokes.

390
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,597
That's what you
did with this trip.

391
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,517
Andy, this whole
idea of our situation

392
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,020
being just like war,
it's just not true.

393
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,938
We just work at
a paper company,

394
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,648
and you're our
regional manager.

395
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,069
And guess what, man? You
don't have to prove anything.

396
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,197
We like you as
regional manager.

397
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,241
Andy, if you don't believe me,
take a look at what's on my head.

398
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,285
I'm wearing a very pink hat.

399
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,455
I've been getting weird looks
all day, because I'm pretty sure

400
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,916
"DM does GB" means
something kind of sexual.

401
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,710
But guess who's wearing them?
All of us.

402
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,380
Just for you, man.
That's huge.

403
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,549
You don't like the hats?

404
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,634
They're terrible.

405
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,802
I hate myself.

406
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,430
They just didn't turn out how I
wanted. In my head, they were cooler.

407
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,515
But they do look weird.

408
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,226
The world
will little note

409
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,603
nor long
remember the fight that

410
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,980
Jim and I had
here at Gettysburg.

411
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,775
And that's good,
because I was basically wrong.

412
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,446
I wanted my team to be like
this army and I was their general,

413
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,906
but I guess it's
really just more like

414
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,826
they're people who work in
an office and I'm their manager.

415
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:49,331
Yeah, that's really probably a better
analogy. Now that I think about it.

416
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,503
Abe and Mary are
seated watching the show.

417
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,508
Oh, Mary, this is wonderful.

418
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,971
Okay, Mary, stop your
scolding. I'll be quiet.

419
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,183
I need her like I need
a hole in the head!

420
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,022
Mmm. Oh...

421
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,776
Bang!
