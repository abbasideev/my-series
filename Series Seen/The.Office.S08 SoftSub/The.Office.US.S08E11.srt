1
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,874
Oh, yeah!

2
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,001
I knew it! I knew it.

3
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,170
Kevin! As soon
as I heard that wrapper.

4
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,089
You really have
to say, "Oh, yeah,"

5
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,382
every time you
eat a candy bar?

6
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,635
I can't help it, Oscar.
It's just really good.

7
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,887
Oh, yeah!

8
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,889
My hands are tied.
All right, not bad at all.

9
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,934
I think we can beat 20 minutes,
though, so let's try again.

10
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,269
Get it all out
now if you have to.

11
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,562
It was a raccoon eating a
hamburger like a person.

12
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,815
You need to stop banging
your pen on your desk,

13
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,525
or it's gonna drive me
insane. Okay, got it.

14
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,151
Does anyone have
a first-aid kit?

15
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,486
Check out
this song I wrote.

16
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,196
I'm gonna love you
downstairs tonight

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,115
Listen, I say...

18
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,284
I mean, he looked
like a little Hamburglar.

19
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,035
All right, here we go!

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,914
Everybody, get ready in
three, two... Good luck. One.

21
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,636
Love letters.
Yes, I love it.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,264
What else can be
done with paper?

23
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,683
You can write
a book about chairs.

24
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,977
Books. Excellent, Jim.

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,271
All right, Andy,
please, please, just stop.

26
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,732
You can do infinite things
with paper.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,776
Did you hear that?

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,532
Infinity. There is an infinity of
things that you can do with paper.

29
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,910
Now, who wants
to buy some paper?

30
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,620
Yeah!

31
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,415
Very nice.
Very nice sales pitch

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,417
for our clients that
don't know what paper is.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,461
I'm talking about you guys.

34
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,882
Who in this room right now
wants to buy some paper?

35
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,427
Let's get high
on our own supply.

36
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,180
Andy, you want us
to buy our own paper?

37
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,431
Yes.

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,309
Robert said that we needed to
double our sales growth to 8%

39
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,355
by the end of the quarter. That's
today, and we are $830 short.

40
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,775
And I can't afford
to keep buying paper from us,

41
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,236
<i>so today we need to
sell $830 of paper,</i>

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,863
and then next quarter,
I need to sell

43
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,990
the $2,200 of paper
that's in my garage.

44
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,995
Animals, machines,
vast virtual armies.

45
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,581
All of these things
I have successfully managed.

46
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,958
The only thing I
haven't managed is people.

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,045
I saw an ad on
the Sabre website

48
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,798
for an open manager position
in their printers division.

49
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,716
I spoke to Robert
California about it

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,052
and he said for me to come by
and see him some time.

51
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,679
So like
a Spanish conquistador,

52
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,225
I have come to Florida to
claim what is rightfully mine.

53
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,477
Dwight Schrute for
Robert California.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,398
Oh. Hello, Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him
you're here. Can I get you anything at all?

55
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,024
I'm not here to
be given anything.

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,567
I'm here to take
what is mine.

57
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,363
Ooh. I'm glad you're on our
team. Here, please have a seat.

58
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,575
Dwight?
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,787
Gabe. You don't know?

60
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,414
Of course I know.

61
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,166
Hmm. Impressive
office you have here.

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,920
Surrounded by shrubbery.
Like a squirrel's office.

63
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,048
Corporate says to me, "Gabe,
we need you in Scranton."

64
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,008
Scranton says,
"Gabe, go back down

65
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,177
to Florida.
You're needed there."

66
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,264
So Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I'm up there.

67
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,892
Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays, I'm down here.

68
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,729
I can think of no better way to
confront my deathly fear of flying.

69
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,940
Dwight.
Robert.

70
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,942
You made it.
Yes.

71
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,610
Impressive initiative.

72
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,864
I don't know what's worse,
the trip or the destination.

73
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,912
Well, let me settle in.

74
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,206
And I'll be with you shortly.

75
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,666
Very good.

76
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,919
Hey, C-SPAN.

77
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,215
So my Dad says an accountant
can really help you out

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,469
if they're willing to play
ball. Those were his words.

79
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,473
Gosh, Andy, you had
a great quarter, okay?

80
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,018
Robert will understand.
$800 is a rounding error.

81
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,562
So make that error.
Andy, no.

82
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,815
Hey, I can make
that error. Oh...

83
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,737
Well, it's just I know that making
errors sounds like your kind of thing,

84
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,072
but it's a little more
complicated than that. No, I...

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,492
It's just I really need
a real accountant on this.

86
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,329
What do you say?

87
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,956
I am leaving early today,

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,918
because tonight I have a
trivia contest in Philadelphia.

89
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,002
Aw...

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,755
Any other crunch time,
I would love

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,173
to stay and cook
the books for you

92
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,342
SO you can save face
in front of your CEO,

93
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,470
but tonight is
Triviacolypse. What?

94
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,847
It's only the biggest night
of trivia of the year.

95
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,308
There's a $1,000 prize.

96
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,435
I'm committed to my friends.
They're committed to me.

97
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,772
You know what? Go. Have fun.

98
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,944
There's a trivia contest
at a bar in Philadelphia.

99
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,363
Stop right there.
I love it. I'm in.

100
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,864
I didn't even say what it is.

101
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,699
It's trivia.
In Philadelphia.

102
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:11,037
But here's the best part.
The prize is $1,000,

103
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:16,209
and if we win, we can use
that money to buy paper here,

104
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,795
close the gap on our
8% profit increase.

105
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,047
That's a great idea. Yeah.
That's a great plan.

106
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,550
Yeah? You like it? All
right. All right, good stuff.

107
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,718
I'm so psyched you guys
are into it, 'cause I thought...

108
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,554
I was like,
"This sounds really stupid."

109
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,806
You just made a good idea,
a great idea.

110
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,975
There is one problem
with this plan. What?

111
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,270
We'd have to leave work,
like, right now to do this.

112
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,480
You can reduce
your prices by 10%,

113
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,567
or we're gonna be finding a new
source for our morning bagels.

114
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,985
All right.

115
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,240
Gabe, I always wondered
what it is you did around here.

116
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,450
Now I found out.
You're the bagel guy.

117
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,745
Yeah, but not just bagels.
All unwanted problems.

118
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,541
Question. What's the most
important appliance in your house?

119
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,295
Meat grinder. Too slow. It's the toilet.

120
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,839
And I am the toilet
of this office.

121
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,507
I flush away
annoying problems,

122
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,217
so others can keep
their hands clean,

123
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,095
and just like a toilet,
I am essential.

124
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,432
You know, Gabe,
you could have gone

125
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,768
with garbage disposal,
incinerator, or eraser.

126
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,313
And instead
you chose toilet.

127
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,648
God bless you.
You are an American classic.

128
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,944
Dwight, today is not my
day at all, I'm afraid.

129
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,529
I'm not going to be
able to meet with you.

130
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,824
But I'm leaving you in the
very capable hands of our COO.

131
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,950
But I can give you
this pitch in one minute.

132
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,118
He's gonna meet
with you later.

133
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,787
No, no, no. I don't
want you to rush it, okay?

134
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,665
Trust me. Meet with Bill.

135
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,336
He's a great person to know.
I'll dialog with him tonight.

136
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,549
CEO to COO. What a
difference a letter makes.

137
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,552
Still an important position.
Still a chief.

138
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,471
You're really
going to like Bill.

139
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,723
He has me toilet
a lot of people for him.

140
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,978
Hallway phone.
Gabe Lewis speaking.

141
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,314
Gabe, listen to me.
Don't bother Bill with this.

142
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,316
He needs to go put out a fire
on the home front.

143
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,070
Just wait 20 minutes, and then I
want you to listen to Dwight's pitch.

144
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,989
Make him feel valued.
Make him feel heard.

145
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,449
Your wish is my command.

146
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,992
It's a command.

147
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,836
I don't believe this.

148
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,590
What are you doing here,
Andy? You left us no choice.

149
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,300
But this should put
a smile on your face.

150
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,595
How would you like to be
captain of the Dunder Mifflin team?

151
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,390
Although I reserve the right
to overrule you. What? No.

152
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,642
I got a quota to hit.
I don't care how I hit it.

153
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,394
And you guys thought
this was a good idea?

154
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,937
I thought it was
a fun idea.

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,982
There were times on the two and a
half hour drive when I experienced doubt.

156
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,068
But that's the thing
about long drives,

157
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,195
you know?
You're always going...

158
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,322
This is a gay bar.
Wait, what?

159
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,282
Everyone in here is gay?

160
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,244
Yes. It's a gay bar, SO you
guys want to go home now?

161
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,495
No.

162
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,579
No.
Awesome.

163
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,874
What does this say about you
that you followed me here?

164
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,042
That you think
you're going to win

165
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,753
your sales quota at
a gay bar's trivia night?

166
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:09,507
It says that I believe
in my staff's intelligence,

167
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,218
and that I'm
willing to try anything.

168
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,848
Not "anything."

169
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,725
Good luck.

170
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,646
All right, we need to
divide up into teams,

171
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,108
but it's winner take all,
so no need to divide evenly.

172
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:31,404
We need an A team, a backup
team, and a just-have-fun team.

173
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,365
So you guys all
know yourselves.

174
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,325
Good timers, follow me.

175
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,370
Back-ups.

176
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,627
Go on, kid. You know
you don't belong here.

177
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,798
A team.
Okay.

178
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,552
All right, everybody,
nice self awareness.

179
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,181
Except...

180
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,816
Okay.

181
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,402
There's a table over here.

182
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,571
All right,
first question, everyone.

183
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,200
Ray Charles famously had
this state on his mind.

184
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,701
What is its capital?

185
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,203
Oh, we got this.

186
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,789
Let's reverse engineer this.

187
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,665
You're a black singer.
Where do you go?

188
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,584
Somewhere where
you're a novelty.

189
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,336
Alaska.
Atlanta.

190
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,214
I know you think that, because
that's where the Olympics were held.

191
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,924
My cousins were
actually at those Olympics.

192
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,967
Keep talking all you want.

193
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,179
How am I supposed to know
what was on his mind?

194
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,348
Ooh! What do blind
people think about?

195
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,478
Okay, dogs, canes, signs,
manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.

196
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,898
Okay, time's up.
Let's get the boards up.

197
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,025
Atlanta, Georgia is
the correct answer.

198
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,074
What?

199
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,535
Hey, man. Uh...

200
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,329
Look, unfortunately,
Bill had to go fight a fire,

201
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,331
So, your appointment got...

202
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,333
There's no fires
within eight miles of here.

203
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, it's nine miles away.

204
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,754
I'm going to be meeting
with you on his behalf.

205
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,466
What? No, no.
Excuse me, lady!

206
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,470
Get anyone from the COO's
office on the phone this instant!

207
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,931
This must be
very frustrating.

208
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,769
I can see you in
the jungle now.

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,358
Hey, now, you're not an All-Star of
the NBA, but you did get your game on

210
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,320
when you won the NBA's Sixth
Man of the Year Award in 2011.

211
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,864
Who are you?

212
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,615
Jim, Darryl,
your time to shine.

213
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
Shawn Marion.
Yes. Shawn Marion.

214
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,121
That doesn't sound right. I want
to say LaDamien Washington?

215
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,455
Wrong for so many reasons.

216
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,207
Well, I know
Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man

217
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,042
was Richard Burton.
Is that helpful?

218
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,713
That's it. I'm gonna go
watch the boats on the river.

219
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,423
Ron Artest, Kelly.

220
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,174
No, it's Lamar Odom.

221
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,217
If it had been Ron Artest,
it would have

222
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,719
come up on
Dancing with the Stars

223
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,928
when they pan
over his trophy case

224
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,805
when he's at home
with his family.

225
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,725
Lamar winning Sixth Man was a
big storyline on Khloé and Lamar.

226
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,603
All right, boards up.
Let's see who got it.

227
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,314
Lamar Odom is what
we were looking for.

228
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,566
Lamar Odom.

229
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,692
Oh, my God,
Lamar Odom.

230
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,860
Nice. Nicely done.

231
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,697
You're my sports guys. You're
ESPN. You're ESPN Classic.

232
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,950
Ryan is MSNBC.
I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.

233
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,620
Chill, man.
This plan is airtight.

234
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,206
So it's a very
simple argument

235
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,668
of why I should be put in
charge of southeast printer sales.

236
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,339
Nobody has sold more printers
in the northeast than me.

237
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,926
Bottom line, I know
the product. I get it.

238
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,844
Well, you got my vote.

239
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,556
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

240
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,726
Most of all, I believe
that character is destiny,

241
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,604
and my character
is one that...

242
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,940
Wait, why are you smiling?

243
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,358
What?
What's with the smile?

244
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,235
You're doing great.
So good.

245
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,530
And my character is one
that will never give up

246
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,451
until greatness is on
the horizon behind us.

247
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,499
Dwight, that was a fantastic
presentation. Put your hand on my hand.

248
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,212
Flush.

249
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,005
Ow!

250
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,799
Take me to Robert.
Ow. He went home.

251
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,676
Take me to his house.
It's a condo.

252
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,760
It's long-term
business housing.

253
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,345
You know where it is.
Lead me there.

254
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,721
Ow. Stephanie, help.

255
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,809
Listen, you're
a perfectly fine toilet.

256
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,145
I'm just an extraordinary
piece of crap. Let's go.

257
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,230
Ow.

258
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,692
Excuse me, sir,
on the Dunder Mifflin A team.

259
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,485
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah?

260
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,988
I'm sure you're just checking
your Grindr account.

261
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,825
But you can't
check smartphones

262
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,535
during trivia.
It's against the rules.

263
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,245
Okay, I'm turning it off.

264
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,039
Okay, you're not
turning it off.

265
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,499
I won't look at it.

266
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,625
Sir.

267
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,211
I can't not touch it.

268
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,214
Okay, then we're gonna
have to take it away.

269
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,176
Thank you. Thank you.

270
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,763
Okay, I can't not
have my phone. I'm sorry.

271
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,225
I want to be with my phone.

272
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,187
All right, guys, after nine
rounds, let's check the scores.

273
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,607
In first place with nine
points, it's Aesop's Foibles.

274
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,029
The Queerenstein
Bears have seven points.

275
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,990
Dunder Mifflin
A team has four points.

276
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,033
All right.

277
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,036
The D.M. Backup Team
has three points.

278
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,580
The Einsteins have
eight points.

279
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,708
Ladies Gaga have five points.

280
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,834
Yeah!

281
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,502
So our best chance
of hitting our mark

282
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,923
is now in the hands and brains
of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly.

283
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,175
Do I like these odds?

284
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,927
My answer is no.
Whoo!

285
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,223
Which one is it? I don't
know! All I know is the building.

286
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,810
Robert! Robert California!

287
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,188
Robert!
Dwight.

288
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,984
How nice of Gabe to
show you where I live.

289
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,736
Come around. 102.

290
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,905
All right, guys, time's up.

291
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,741
Who was the relatively
unknown patent clerk

292
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,743
who discovered
that energy equals

293
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,745
mass times
the speed of light squared?

294
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,997
Looks like everyone gets
a point for Albert Einstein.

295
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,168
Wait, except
for the Einsteins.

296
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,420
That's all right.

297
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,339
Which means
the top three teams

298
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,341
are going to finish it
off in the speed round.

299
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,176
So let's get
everyone some bells.

300
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,054
In third place,
we have the Einsteins.

301
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,722
Oh, yeah!
What?

302
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,811
Second place, we have
the Queerenstein Bears.

303
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,978
Yeah!
Come on!

304
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,356
<i>And first place
is Aesop's Foibles.</i>

305
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
Whoo!

306
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,402
Yeah, but they're
going to get clobbered.

307
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,405
Ring it in when you know it.
First question.

308
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,534
This man had a fatwa
declared on him when...

309
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,286
Einsteins?

310
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,955
What?
What is it?

311
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,499
I did my part, babe.
I'm just the bell girl.

312
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,834
Aesop's?

313
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,169
Salman Rushdie.
Salman Rushdie is correct.

314
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,383
Heading out to sea, sailors.

315
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,594
On a square-rigged
ship, the sail

316
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,847
set furthest
forward is called what?

317
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,058
Princess Ding-Dong,
do not hit that bell...

318
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,560
Flying jib.

319
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,604
Flying jib is
correct for the Einsteins.

320
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,652
Flying jib. Flying jib.

321
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,362
No way.

322
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,615
Gentlemen.

323
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,039
Give us just a minute. Stew and
I are just finishing up our lesson.

324
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,917
Trust me,
one nine-minute bout

325
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,922
is a cardiovascular equivalent
of running uphill for three hours.

326
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,886
I could go to
the gym three times a week,

327
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,637
or I can wrestle
Stew once a month.

328
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,480
Grab my leg!

329
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,066
Yay, Robert!

330
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,612
Guys, please help yourself
to some drinks from the fridge.

331
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,199
According to a recent survey,

332
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,203
this is the most common learning
disability among American adolescents.

333
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,663
Boom! ADHD.
No.

334
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,708
Wrong. The
answer is dyslexia!

335
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,543
That's correct
for the Einsteins.

336
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,882
All right.
Whoo! Yeah!

337
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:34,053
Sir, sir. Dial it back. This
isn't Tail Feathers, okay?

338
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,142
Yeah!

339
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,771
They haven't really improved
on the Oreo, have they?

340
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,066
No, thank you.

341
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,776
Sit down, Dwight.

342
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,156
Let me tell you
why I should be

343
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,991
the next manager
with a riddle.

344
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,162
A manager,
a salesman, a leader

345
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,165
and a warrior walk
into a restaurant.

346
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,252
The hostess says,
"Table for one?"

347
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,712
How is this possible?

348
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,008
You were dining alone.
All those people are you.

349
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,345
Yes. Exactly. Riddle
number two. Who is going...

350
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:24,311
Your drive, your ambition, it
would be wasted on a manager's job.

351
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,106
And Florida,
you don't want to live here.

352
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,691
Even I don't
want to live here.

353
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,026
It's why I'm always at
my place in Scranton.

354
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,113
Florida is America's basement.

355
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:39,952
It's wet. It's filled with mold,
strange insects, alligators.

356
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,122
Alligators are dinosaurs,
Dwight. You know that, right?

357
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,249
Eh... It's complicated.

358
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,383
This medal was
my grandfather's.

359
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,598
He received it for acts of
courage, for excellence.

360
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,730
It's a tribute
one man gives another.

361
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,525
I could give you
a job, Dwight.

362
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,362
But why not let me give you
something even better?

363
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,205
It's a job interview.
Not a flea market.

364
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,252
Dwight, the job is
not right for you.

365
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,463
Now, when something
comes along

366
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,757
that is right for you,
I'll try you out.

367
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,260
Now get the hell
out of my place.

368
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,511
Yes.

369
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,349
Final round.
Last two teams squaring off.

370
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,434
I hope you're
ready to play doctor.

371
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,520
Our question is about
health and the human body.

372
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,730
Oh, come on.

373
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,191
The standard
American analog scale

374
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,735
has a maximum capacity
of what weight?

375
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,029
Three hundred pounds.

376
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,156
Point for the Einsteins.

377
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,869
Here's your final question.
Cinephiles, put on your memory berets.

378
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,248
This 2001 masterpiece
from Gilles Paquet-Brenner

379
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,002
explores the intricate
dynamics of a family in disarray.

380
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,717
Yes!

381
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,512
I'm sorry, no.
Over to the Einsteins.

382
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,139
- Les Jolies Choses.
- Are you sure?

383
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:29,186
Marion Cotillard
exposes herself

384
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,480
a number of times
in that film.

385
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,564
The Einsteins win it.

386
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,732
No!
Yeah!

387
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,234
Come on!

388
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,656
Look, I know it's easy to say
tonight was just a fluke,

389
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,243
and maybe it was,
but here's a piece of trivia.

390
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,080
A fluke is one of the most
common fish in the sea.

391
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,166
So if you go
fishing for a fluke,

392
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,294
chances are you
Just might catch one.

393
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,171
Oh, boy.

394
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,677
Welcome to the Stonewall
Alliance Trivia Championships!

395
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,806
First prize is $2,500.

396
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,768
Let's just do our thing, collect our
hardware, and get the hell home.

397
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,478
Whoo!
Riboflavin.

398
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,231
Riboflavin?

399
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,399
Michigan.

400
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,363
The President of
the United States

401
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,365
is POTUS.

402
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,911
John Steinbeck wrote
The Grapes of Wrath.
