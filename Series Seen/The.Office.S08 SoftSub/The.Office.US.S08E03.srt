1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,211
Back orders and you
never called them.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,299
Can you believe this?
There's a dog in the car.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,428
You can't leave a dog
in a parked car!

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,847
Snowboarder, it figures.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,390
Do snowboarders
hate animals?

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,642
I bet this guy didn't
leave his weed in the car.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,229
Okay, we have to do something,
because this is incredibly dangerous.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,564
Oscar, it's not
that hot out.

9
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,774
A car parked in the sun
is like a toaster oven.

10
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,277
Well, we don't know how long
the driver's been gone,

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,112
and it's not
in direct sunlight.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,364
So what, Andy? You want to
just let him die, you scumbag?

13
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,491
Here, I'm going
to get in my car.

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,078
When I start dying, I will
honk the horn three times.

15
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,872
That means
save the dog.

16
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,040
Okay,
you know what?

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,458
I'm going to give him
something to drink.

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,542
Come here, doggy.

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,129
Come on.

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,214
Dwight,
at least aim it.

21
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,548
There you go.
Here, doggy.

22
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,133
He's not even trying.
Come here, doggy, come on.

23
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,468
We're losing
cloud cover.

24
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,220
Don't try to get in
on it now, Michael Vick.

25
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,305
Hey, hey, hey.
Vick did his time.

26
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,350
This guy's been gone long enough.
He's lost his right to a window.

27
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,601
Get back, buddy.
Get back.

28
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,894
Oscar, what are you...
What... No, hey!

29
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,482
All right.

30
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,900
Yeah!

31
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,652
Nice job, Oscar.

32
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,154
And one for good
measure.

33
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,530
Yeah!

34
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,824
So, who's going
to take the dog?

35
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,493
Why would we
take the dog?

36
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,370
What if he jumps out
the window and runs away?

37
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,705
Jim, he's not going
to start...

38
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,998
Stay, stay.

39
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,708
Nein. Sitz!

40
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,418
Gut.

41
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,712
Oscar, what do you want to do?
This is kind of your deal.

42
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,172
You want a dog?

43
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,928
There we go,
that should do it.

44
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,013
Yeah, it's good.
It'll work.

45
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,056
Nice job.

46
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,683
Bye, poochie.
Bye, doggy.

47
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,434
Bye.

48
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,797
What's that come to? Like,
what did they each win?

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,466
Oh, man, it's gotta
be over $100,000.

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,843
Yeah, before taxes.

51
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,720
That's still
a lot of money.

52
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,764
The warehouse crew won
the lottery yesterday.

53
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,809
$950,000.

54
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,269
And then they quit.

55
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,062
And no one else
can focus.

56
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,355
This is it.

57
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,773
This is all
on my shoulders.

58
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,984
I'm the one who has to tell
everyone to get back to work.

59
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,653
I'm the one who has to tell Darryl
to hire a new warehouse crew.

60
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,906
I'm the one who has
to say those things.

61
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,494
Hello?

62
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,415
Justine.

63
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,751
Nice surprise.
How you doing, baby?

64
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,838
No, no, no.
I didn't win.

65
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,340
When I got promoted,
I stopped...

66
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,466
What?

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,218
Yeah, Glenn won.

68
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,182
You want to call him?
Yeah, you should call him.

69
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,767
Congratulate him.
That would be...

70
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,769
What?

71
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,230
His number is
in your old phone.

72
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,024
Oh, you know what?
I might have it right...

73
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,192
Whoops.

74
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,862
When I worked in the warehouse,
I was part of that lotto pool.

75
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,739
They won

76
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,325
playing my birthday.

77
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,536
What really interests me is
the group dynamic of six people

78
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,621
winning the lottery.

79
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,830
This will not
end well, right?

80
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah.

81
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,458
We're looking at,
at least one suicide

82
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,335
and one weird sex thing.
At least.

83
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,295
I don't even know what
I'd do with all that money.

84
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,713
I know what you'd do
with all that money.

85
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,633
"Hey, Pam. Let's buy
expensive bathrobes and hug."

86
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,094
No, I'd probably buy a
big piece of land in Maine,

87
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,179
build a house,
work in town.

88
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,723
Somewhere I could
bike to or kayak to.

89
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,975
I'd either bike to my job
at the kayak shop

90
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,061
or I'd kayak to my job
at the bike shop.

91
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,521
And then on the weekends,
would you hacky sack

92
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,606
back to reality and spend time
with your wife and kids?

93
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,234
Whoa, Saucy, I
thought you liked Maine.

94
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,694
I think we should get
a townhouse in Soho.

95
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,196
Soho's mostly lofts,
but okay.

96
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,449
And then, every morning,
I'd walk out onto my terrace,

97
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,244
and I would breathe in
the inspiration of the city.

98
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,580
You know, and just gather
ideas for my painting.

99
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,790
Oh, God.

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,583
And then my
handsome husband...

101
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,876
Which, ideally,
would be me.

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,044
Would bring me
a flavored coffee.

103
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,505
Stop. I'm a barista
in your fantasy?

104
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,424
Well, in your fantasy, we're
Stephen King characters.

105
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't know
about Stephen King.

106
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,010
Get a divorce.
Get a divorce.

107
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,929
I think I would
keep working.

108
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,516
And for my salary, I guess
I would take, like, $1 a year.

109
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,936
Obviously, I wouldn't
come in till noon.

110
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,021
And I wouldn't do anything
I didn't want to do.

111
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,484
I mean, I'm getting paid $1
a year, okay? You can chill.

112
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,987
Are you kidding me?

113
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,448
Guys, if I have to ask you to
get back to work one more time,

114
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,408
I'm gonna change my tone.

115
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,410
To down here, like Mr. T.

116
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,704
And this would get
seriously annoying.

117
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,748
I feel sympathy for the jerks
who have to listen to this all day.

118
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,292
Darryl.

119
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,751
How we doing on
the new warehouse guys?

120
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,878
I don't know.

121
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,297
What... Do we have
new guys?

122
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,381
No.

123
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,757
Are they on
their way over?

124
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,842
I haven't hired anyone.

125
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,469
What? No warehouse guys?

126
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,804
I have an important order
that has to go out by 5:00.

127
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,473
I e-mailed you about it.

128
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,391
I'm not checking
e-mail till lunch.

129
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,268
Four hour work week.

130
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,644
This is kind of
time-sensitive.

131
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,021
I got it. I'm doing it.

132
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,900
Andy, this is a seriously big
order. I can't lose this client.

133
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,526
All right, well,
until we have a new crew,

134
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,111
let's get some volunteers
for warehouse duty.

135
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,237
Who's in?

136
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,822
As long as you guys
don't need me up here.

137
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,741
I think we'll be fine.
No, we don't.

138
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,118
Really? Nobody's going
to help her?

139
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,287
Is chivalry dead?
Are you volunteering?

140
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,414
Of course, I would.

141
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,833
But my hip...

142
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,335
I would kill
to be at 100%.

143
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,461
Jim, how about you?

144
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,712
Yeah. I mean,

145
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,964
as the strongest person in
this office, I guess I should...

146
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,508
Okay, no, no.

147
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,302
That... You are
so not... Oh, God.

148
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,890
False. Andy,
I will volunteer.

149
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,350
Great.

150
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,018
And Kevin.

151
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:57,273
Good old Kevin.
He'll do anything.

152
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,025
Well, guess what?

153
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,945
I will not do
a good job.

154
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,033
Thank you.
Sure.

155
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,284
Wait, wait.
What's this?

156
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,745
Oh, sorry.

157
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,248
I thought it was a
guess-your-baby's-birth-weight pool.

158
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,084
It says "lotto pool"
right on top.

159
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,794
Yeah, and I said sorry.

160
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,421
Oh, come on.

161
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,549
You really think I'm going
to have a 14-pound baby?

162
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,308
When did I get so fat?

163
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,851
You look awesome.

164
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,687
I didn't hire anyone,
if that's why you're here.

165
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,980
Where are we
in the process?

166
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,898
I have a file
of applicants here.

167
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,568
I just gotta open it,
look at it,

168
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,486
interview a bunch of guys,
hire some of them.

169
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,822
So I say we're in the
early stages of the process.

170
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,616
Did you go out celebrating
with the guys last night?

171
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,702
They guys did invite
me out to celebrate,

172
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,996
but I decided
to just stay home.

173
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,665
Eat a bunch of tacos
in my basement.

174
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,709
You do have
a fantastic basement.

175
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,835
I did.

176
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,171
I did have
a fantastic basement.

177
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
Now it smells
like tacos.

178
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,177
You can't air out
a basement.

179
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,471
And taco air is heavy.

180
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,890
It settles
at the lowest point.

181
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,228
Right. Um.

182
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,189
Well, how about we take
a look at some applications?

183
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,900
This guy wrote his
in green ink.

184
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,235
That's pretty cool.
Check it out.

185
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,783
Hey.

186
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,952
There you go.
There he is.

187
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,080
That is not Darryl.

188
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,458
I don't know where Darryl is.
I suspect, probably,

189
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,045
our Darryl is inside
of Fat Darryl.

190
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,257
Okay, 300 boxes
of 20-pound white.

191
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,136
That's 75 boxes per person.
So, that's not so bad.

192
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,220
Negative.

193
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,515
Three hundred boxes for me,
zero for you chumps.

194
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,808
Deal with it.

195
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,186
Nice.

196
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,189
Oh, oh, oh!

197
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,359
Damn.

198
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
Yup.

199
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,129
Welcome, everybody.

200
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,175
My name is Andy, and this
is my other brother, Darryl.

201
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,721
What? No Newhart fans?

202
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,556
Okay.

203
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,600
Darryl, how do we usually
kick these things off?

204
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,437
You mean, what did we do the last
time the warehouse won the lottery?

205
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,939
Your old crew
won the lottery?

206
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:48,361
Does anyone have experience
shelving, storing, keeping track...

207
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,987
What do we use?
The Dewey Decimal System?

208
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,365
Wait, wait. So, all
the old guys quit?

209
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh, yeah.
Well...

210
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,661
One of them, Glenn, is
starting one of those fat camps

211
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,413
where he steals your kid
in the middle of the night.

212
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,249
Madge and a couple other
guys might start a strip club.

213
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,542
But on a boat.

214
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,797
And Hide is investing in an
energy drink for Asian homosexuals.

215
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,718
Could you guys
give us a minute?

216
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,512
But stay close.
You're all doing great.

217
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,724
Maybe grab a coffee,
or if there's any donuts out,

218
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,850
you can split one.

219
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,644
You know, they're for
everybody, so people get fussy.

220
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,480
You know what?
Just have a donut.

221
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,200
Do you want to talk about this
not-winning-the-lottery thing?

222
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,243
I don't.

223
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,997
You sure? "Cause you
keep talking about it, so...

224
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,208
Nope. I'm good.
I'm here.

225
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,919
Let's find some warehouse
workers. Good, great.

226
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,298
Then, can you say things that aren't,
like, a huge bummer to everybody?

227
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,593
'Cause the more I talk, the
more they're going to realize

228
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,052
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

229
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,137
Okay.

230
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,805
We need you, okay?
Okay.

231
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,890
Okay?
Yeah.

232
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,016
All right.

233
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
Ah!

234
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,565
What's the problem?

235
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,692
Grunting is scientifically
proven to add more power.

236
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,611
Ask any female tennis player,

237
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,029
or her husband.

238
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,326
I didn't feel anything.

239
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,290
All right, thank you
for coming back in again.

240
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,543
Now, we're going to ask you a few
questions. Darryl, you have the floor.

241
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,795
Why do you want
to work here?

242
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,004
I need a job.

243
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,130
It's not a good reason.

244
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,215
Good.

245
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,508
Keeping them honest.

246
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,551
Don't just take the first
job that comes your way.

247
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,514
"Cause next thing you know, it's
10 years later, and you're still there.

248
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,849
You could write
your obituary tomorrow.

249
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,059
It's not going
to change.

250
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,771
Are we scaring
them straight?

251
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,897
I hope so.

252
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,148
Think about
this carefully.

253
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,567
There's better lives
than this one.

254
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,450
I've never been lucky.

255
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,910
And I'm not talking
about the lottery.

256
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,748
I'm talking about stuff like
developing a soy allergy at 35.

257
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,544
Who gets a soy allergy at 35?

258
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,921
And why is soy in everything?

259
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,508
Nice, right back
where I like you.

260
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,635
Can you make 10
copies of this for me? No.

261
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,095
Why not? What
are you doing?

262
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,222
Buying lottery
tickets online.

263
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,602
Everyone wants to be rich,
but nobody wants to work for it.

264
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,855
You came in
at 10:30 today, right?

265
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,857
Okay, I'll just
do this myself.

266
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,529
Is everyone licensed?
Like a driver's license?

267
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,155
No, warehouse license.

268
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,284
Masters in
warehouse sciences?

269
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,704
I feel that Darryl has talked
about a license of some kind.

270
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,790
Is this a joke?
No. Not joking.

271
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,125
This is real.

272
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,670
Painfully real, what is
happening right now.

273
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,009
Okay, I'm not going to
make it. I'm turning back.

274
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,636
There's gotta be
a better way to do this.

275
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,388
This is literally how
they built the pyramids.

276
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,599
Well, they whipped people,
which was helpful.

277
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,059
But you're right. We should be
able to find a more efficient way

278
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,978
of moving boxes
than Madge or Hide.

279
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,062
Yeah.

280
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,648
Not that they're
not smart people.

281
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,984
No, no, very smart...

282
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,527
Theirs is more of a
physical intelligence.

283
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,612
I'd go with that.

284
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,905
Like baboons
or elephants.

285
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,114
Not that, don't...

286
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,035
Guys, when I was a kid, my
sisters used to butter me up

287
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,788
and slide me across the
linoleum floor of the kitchen.

288
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,624
It really made
them laugh.

289
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,750
It's a great idea, Kev.

290
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,792
I don't think
it applies here, though.

291
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,877
So, maybe we just...

292
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,504
Yeah, we move stuff
and have fun.

293
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,756
Kevin,
doesn't apply.

294
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,466
Right, my mom...

295
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,052
You need
to drop it, okay?

296
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,428
They hate it.

297
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,181
I like it a lot, but
they hate it, so drop it.

298
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,647
Does anyone get distracted
easily by bubble wrap?

299
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,695
You'll be dealing with lots of
bubble wrap, obviously. Um...

300
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,364
How much longer
is this going to take?

301
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,700
Did you hire them?

302
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,036
No, because
they all left.

303
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,038
What do you mean
they left?

304
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,832
I mean, after you bailed,

305
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,211
I got confused, and
frankly, a little weird.

306
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,673
And the stuff that you said
certainly didn't help.

307
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,716
Then I think you
should fire me.

308
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,636
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to fire you.

309
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,638
Yeah, just put me out
of my misery.

310
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,144
Okay, this is weird.
I don't get the joke.

311
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,646
No? Okay.

312
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,234
I don't want
to be here anymore.

313
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,903
Fire me.

314
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,077
So Darryl says
to me, "Fire me,"

315
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,746
but what he really means is,

316
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,958
“I'm going to say something really
weird, try and figure out what it means."

317
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,128
So I say, "No,
you're not fired."

318
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,296
But what I really mean is,

319
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,799
"I've no idea what
you're talking about.

320
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,759
"But I'm going to go ahead
and hire some people

321
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,512
“for the warehouse and hope that
you eventually start feeling better."

322
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,976
I really hope that's
what he and I mean.

323
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,854
Attention.

324
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,939
Does anyone know anyone who
could work in the warehouse?

325
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,065
We can pay.

326
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,859
Come on, Oscar.

327
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,944
Who's the most jacked guy
in all of Scranton?

328
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,487
Like your wildest
fantasy guy?

329
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,780
Bulk or definition?

330
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,032
Definition.

331
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,242
Bruce Kenward. He
hangs out at Planet Fitness.

332
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,703
Are those just show muscles,
or is he really strong?

333
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
Oh, he's plenty strong.

334
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,541
It used to be Reggie Winters
out at Gold's Gym.

335
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,625
But he moved away.

336
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,128
And then it was between
Bruce and this guy, Dean.

337
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,799
But Dean got fixated
on his calves,

338
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
and, uh...

339
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,344
And his triceps
went to hell.

340
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,555
So, I've been thinking,

341
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,599
after we win the lottery,
we take our winnings...

342
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,683
Our fake winnings.

343
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,435
And we move
to the South of France.

344
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,438
See... No, there's plenty
of bicycling for you.

345
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,689
I think that's where they
do the Tour de France.

346
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,815
It is, yeah.

347
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,025
I mean, I just don't know
why I'm compromising

348
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,109
if it's my fantasy.

349
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,528
Because in my fantasy,
it's Maine, and you love it.

350
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,864
Because I'm never going to
act like that, even in your fantasy.

351
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,826
Nope, you're doing a great
job of it in my fantasy right now.

352
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,579
Hey, idiot, what did
Erin want again?

353
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,623
A hot chocolate tea.

354
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,294
Gideon, you are
a PhD candidate

355
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,255
studying America's diminishing
blue-collar workforce?

356
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,465
North America.

357
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,177
And "diminishing" is a little reductive,
but, sure, that's the headline version.

358
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,887
Great.

359
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,182
Well, it will bring a fresh, new
perspective to the warehouse.

360
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,435
FYI, Wednesday through Friday, I
have a pretty full teaching schedule.

361
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,854
Oh, cool. We'll figure that out.

362
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,648
Also, FYI,

363
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,277
I don't technically
have a hearing problem.

364
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,698
But sometimes, when there's a lot
of noises occurring at the same time,

365
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,700
I'll hear them
as one big jumble.

366
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,954
Again, it's not
that I can't hear.

367
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,705
Because that's false, I can.

368
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,835
Um, I just can't distinguish
between everything I'm hearing.

369
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,129
Got it. Duly noted.

370
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,213
You,

371
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,299
coolest tank top I have ever
seen. Where did you get that?

372
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,051
Made it.
So cool.

373
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,553
What a cross section
we have here.

374
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,096
It's what I love
about interviewing.

375
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,305
I get to meet
all these people

376
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,392
I wouldn't ordinarily meet,
or know or even talk to.

377
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,477
Message in a Bottle,
The Postman...

378
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,688
Kevin Costner.
Kevin Costner, yeah.

379
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,485
So...

380
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,987
I found this grease.

381
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,489
And then I remembered that
you thought it was a great idea.

382
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,408
You did say
it was a great idea.

383
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,576
I heard you say it.

384
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,455
So it's not
the dumbest idea.

385
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,665
It's not the
greatest one...

386
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,834
But the fact remains,
we gotta move these boxes.

387
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,878
And it's clear we're
not going to carry them.

388
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,673
So sadly, it's the best
idea on the table. Exactly.

389
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,301
Hey, I think we're
ready to get this...

390
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,344
Jim?
Is he okay?

391
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,596
He'll be fine.

392
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,601
Surprise! Your new crew.

393
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,103
Would you just
fire me, man?

394
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,857
Hey, why? Because
you didn't win the lottery?

395
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,359
How am I supposed
to make you happy?

396
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,236
You want to make
me happy? Huh?

397
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,487
Yeah.
Give me your job.

398
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,781
Haha. What? I'll
do it better than you.

399
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
I earned it,
I deserve it,

400
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,494
I got passed over,
God knows why.

401
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,497
Reasons I cannot
and will not understand.

402
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,959
The job was mine, Andy.
Everyone said it was mine.

403
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,546
Make me manager
or fire me.

404
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,465
I'm not going
to give you my job.

405
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,091
It's my job!
I earned it!

406
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,012
And here's the thing. You
weren't even next in line.

407
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,847
I asked about you.
I saw your file.

408
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,515
You have a history of
being short with people,

409
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,684
and you hired Glenn,
your buddy,

410
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,102
to replace you
in the warehouse.

411
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,313
He was under-qualified.
They saw that.

412
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,190
Also, Darryl, FYI,

413
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,858
I already told
this to Andy,

414
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,151
but you should
probably know

415
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,029
I technically don't have
a hearing problem.

416
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,783
It's just when there's a lot
of noises... Nate. Please.

417
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,118
Thank you.

418
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,123
You have no
business education.

419
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,960
You were going to take classes under
Deangelo. What happened to that?

420
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,086
He died.

421
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,712
He didn't die,
his brain died.

422
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,798
And my brain is still
very much alive.

423
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,925
And I'd be happy to give
you business classes.

424
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,426
How come you haven't
asked me about it?

425
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,886
What was...
What was the last...

426
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,930
I'm having a...

427
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,349
No part of this has
anything to do with you.

428
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,144
I didn't have time
because of my daughter.

429
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,146
But you had time
for a softball clinic.

430
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,606
And a Mediterranean
cooking class.

431
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,859
Hey, I'm not going to tell you this stuff
if you're going to throw it back in my face!

432
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,111
Hey, here's the thing.

433
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,738
Jo saw something in you.
She loved you.

434
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,492
She gave you a shot, and
then you stopped pushing.

435
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,119
She noticed.

436
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,295
Okay.

437
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,379
Okay, what?

438
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,883
Okay, don't fire me.

439
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,556
Okay.

440
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,477
My future's not going to be determined
by seven little white lotto balls.

441
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,772
It's going to be determined
by two big black balls.

442
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,400
I control my destiny.

443
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,736
I do.

444
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,530
I'll put some
guys on tonight.

445
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,866
The best of your bunch
and my bunch.

446
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,076
I'll tell you now, though, it's
going to be mostly my bunch.

447
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,911
Yeah, that makes sense.

448
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,580
Okay, good.
All right.

449
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,123
Are they here?

450
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,750
What is going on?

451
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,834
Oh, hey, guys.

452
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,711
Why is the forklift
in the wall?

453
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,129
Why is
the truck empty?

454
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,672
It's not totally empty.

455
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,923
Is that grease
on my floor?

456
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,968
Okay.

457
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,137
I can see why you're angry.
You're coming into this cold.

458
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,849
But believe me, a lot
of thought went into this.

459
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,435
And did your brains tell you to
ruin these boxes with grease?

460
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,936
Okay, Darryl.

461
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,689
Listen, and then
you will understand.

462
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,068
The boxes were ruined
during our first trial testing.

463
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,695
So now, it's cool, "cause we
found another use for them.

464
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay, all right.

465
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,450
That's... Look, all we were trying to
do is we thought we could come up

466
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,118
with a more efficient
way to do things.

467
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,661
And?

468
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,871
And we did.
I don't know.

469
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,165
Jim, tell them
what it's called.

470
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,209
That's all right.

471
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,543
No, Jim, tell them
what the name is.

472
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,128
Doesn't matter
what the name is.

473
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,256
Sefior Loadenstein,
that's stupid.

474
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,384
Sefior Loadenstein.

475
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,052
Tell them why
it's called that, Jim.

476
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,845
That's okay, we're good.

477
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,307
No, Jim, tell us why it's
called sefior Loadenstein.

478
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,560
Porque es muy rapido.

479
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,896
Okay, you know what?
It's been a real busy day.

480
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,022
What do you say
we put all this away?

481
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,607
Let me see it.

482
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,234
It's in beta testing.

483
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,485
Let me see it!

484
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,569
Get the thing, go!

485
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,947
Lube it up.
Kevin, start mopping.

486
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,324
Uno, dos, tres.

487
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,497
Yeah. I lost my client.

488
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,086
I already won the lottery. I
was born in the US of A, baby.

489
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,296
And as backup,
I have a Swiss passport.

490
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,216
I would spend
a lot of time

491
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,511
launching my true crime
podcast, "The Flenderson Files."

492
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,012
Duh-buh-bum.

493
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,014
Flenderson Files.

494
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,433
We came
to an agreement.

495
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,102
We're going to live in a
stunning pre-war brownstone

496
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,311
at the top of a mountain.

497
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,938
Right, it's city
and country combined.

498
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,899
Just a subway stop away are
the best museums in the world.

499
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,361
And I can fish right from the
window of Pam's pottery studio.

500
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,530
We can chat
any time we want.

501
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,906
Just like now.

502
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,533
Just like now.

503
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,911
It's too bad the schools are terrible,
but what are you going to do about that?

504
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,996
What are you
going to do?
