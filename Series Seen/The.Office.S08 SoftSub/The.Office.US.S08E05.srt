1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,714
Approved.

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,760
Chef from South Park.
It's genius. Just some chef.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,598
I've decided to pre-screen all of
the Halloween costumes this year.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,891
I have three simple rules,

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,101
don't be offensive,
don't be cliché

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,937
and don't take the first
two rules too seriously.

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,983
The gorilla from Rise
of the Planet of the Apes.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,276
Huh?

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,570
The one who
sacrifices his life.

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,821
Whoa! Oh.

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,699
Spoiler alert. It's
been out for ages, man.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,576
Costume vetoed.

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,370
Uh...

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,081
It's... Somebody's
already called that.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,376
Who? Kevin has a gorilla
suit you could borrow.

16
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,213
This is ridiculous! Why can't
there just be two Kate Middletons?

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,382
Guys, I know, I mean I
wish there could be too.

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,927
It's like I can't choose.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,887
They're both
amazing, it's just...

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,723
Look, I stayed up all night
and I watched that G.D. wedding

21
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,975
and then I came to work and I
made everyone else watch it all day.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,728
Meredith wasn't even here.
Because I was there.

23
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,774
You're the
people's princess! Diana was nothing!

24
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,651
I thought you were
at your sister's funeral.

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,196
What I said was, "My sister's
funeral is this weekend."

26
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,405
Didn't say
I'd be there.

27
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,325
Why is it such a shock
that I follow the royal story?

28
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,371
Warms my heart, thinking
about them two kids...

29
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,957
...doing it.

30
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,406
Can I maybe
squeeze through?

31
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,743
Here you go.
There we go. Thank you.

32
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,997
When they talk about all the
nice things about dating a co-worker,

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,999
they don't mention
one of the best parts.

34
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,836
After you're done dating, you still
get to work together every single day.

35
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,965
Jim, put it on.

36
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,009
Put it on, man.

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,970
I don't know if I can.
Come on, the Three Amigos.

38
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,139
Three Kings.
All right.

39
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,225
I know, I know, I know. But
Darryl and Kevin needed a third.

40
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,644
They bought me
this jersey. I said no.

41
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,398
Kevin started crying, so
I am Chris Bosh.

42
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,319
If you get into
season one, you know, really...

43
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,571
Oh, my God, what the hell
is wrong with you?

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,990
It's called a costume.

45
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,742
What are you? Some kind
of Jamaican zombie woman?

46
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,494
Ryan, will you please tell her
who I am? Whoopi Goldberg.

47
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,748
Has no one here heard
of Kerrigan, from StarCraft?

48
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,000
Queen of blades.

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,337
It's all Toby's fault.

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,172
Every Halloween,
I tell him the same thing.

51
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,090
You can't bring weapons
into the office.

52
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,217
And every year he says
the same thing.

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,803
"As soon as I get my weapons
back, I'm going to kill you."

54
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,557
But there I am at
Thanksgiving alive, you know?

55
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,185
I'm a lucky turkey.

56
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,274
Everybody looking good?
This is the best we can do?

57
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,070
I'm not judging. I think
you guys look great, I just...

58
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,865
...want to make sure
this is the best we can do.

59
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,451
I just got a text
from Broccoli Rob. "Boo!"

60
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,703
It scared me.

61
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,206
And then I got this text
from Robert California.

62
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,084
"Looking forward to Halloween
party. Expectations are high."

63
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,504
Scared the
out of me.

64
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,383
G'day, Pameroo. Could
you shoot this off for me?

65
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
Yeah.
Australian accent.

66
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,892
What are you doing? I just
wanted to see how you do it.

67
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,394
If you're doing
something I don't.

68
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,236
Are you... That
Andy, so hot and cold.

69
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,279
One day he's like,
"Fax these documents, please."

70
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,658
The next he's like, "Pam, you fax them.
Who cares what Erin's feeling." Right?

71
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,410
Oh, Erin.
Pam,

72
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,995
how would you rate me as a
receptionist on a scale of one to three?

73
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,414
Um.

74
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,540
Two?

75
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,417
It's like the second to
last thing I wanted to hear.

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,793
No, I mean
you're doing great

77
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,629
and Andy put you in charge
of the whole party, right?

78
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,172
Yeah.
Yeah.

79
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,510
Send completed. You are
the best in the biz. I can't deny.

80
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,888
Bob and I are doing this
Scranton haunted walking tour.

81
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,182
I always wondered what kind
of people went on that thing.

82
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
Hey, if you go
by the Banshee Pub,

83
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,521
tell the Man in Black
I say hello.

84
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,361
What happened, Pam?
Okay.

85
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,157
When I was 22, I worked there and
everybody said the place was haunted.

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,368
I didn't believe it until one
day, before we opened,

87
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,288
I look up into the mirror,
you know, behind the bar?

88
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,542
And I see this old man
dressed all in black,

89
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,546
but when I turn around,
there's no one there.

90
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,049
So, I tell the cook my story...
Wait, they have food there?

91
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,634
...and he said,

92
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,889
"That's what everyone sees.
That's the Man in Black."

93
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,019
No. My wife does not
believe in ghosts.

94
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,273
Hey.

95
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,357
Oh.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,235
This Man in Black thing. What
do you think that was about?

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,488
What do you mean? Was
it like trickery in the lights

98
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,781
or maybe you were so primed
to see it, then there it was.

99
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,159
I saw a ghost.
Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,912
What I'm saying is, like, do
you ever wonder what it was?

101
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,289
It was a ghost. I told you
this on like our first date.

102
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,334
Yeah, I had just told you about
the day that I met the Blue Angels.

103
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,337
I figured you had to top it. I
don't know what to tell you, Jim,

104
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,172
but I saw a ghost.

105
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,346
Hey!

106
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,597
Uh-oh.

107
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,767
Looks like we're under a Jack
attack. - Yes, Andrew.

108
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,437
And you, on this day
of fantasy, are a laborer.

109
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,360
Yes. Everyone,
this is Bert, my son.

110
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,280
Bert, this is
a paper company.

111
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,698
Hey, Bert!

112
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,283
Hello.

113
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,994
Can I use a computer?
I need to check a hurricane.

114
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,704
Here, use this one.

115
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,625
All right.

116
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,462
Oh, look, pin the word
on the witch.

117
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,464
How did you know
I was bringing my son?

118
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,634
I didn't. It was for us.
But he can play.

119
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,761
Berty Boy, would you
like to play this game?

120
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,263
That stuff's for babies.

121
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,559
Perhaps this party will
awaken the baby in all of us.

122
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,521
Wow. Who shot our grownup
party with the kiddy ray gun?

123
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,857
We're still getting it set up.
It's going to be really cool.

124
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,447
Extraordinary.
Did you plan this?

125
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,658
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.

126
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,412
And I overheard and thought,
"Hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do."

127
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,248
If you turn out the lights,
we'll do a little dance.

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,166
One, two, three.

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,837
Dem bones,
dem bones, dem dry bones

130
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,840
Now we're the skeleton crew

131
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,260
Delightful.
Thank you.

132
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,429
Now then,
how are we today?

133
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,888
Fine.
Great.

134
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,432
Just fine, Kelly?
Everything all right?

135
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,600
Mm-hmm.

136
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,476
You feeling fulfilled
in your life?

137
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,686
I guess.

138
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,606
You guess? So there is
something you want that you

139
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,816
do not have.

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,027
Try not to think
about it.

141
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,739
Because it's too
terrifying to imagine.

142
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,199
Now we're cooking.

143
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,454
What is it, Kelly? What
is this great fear of yours?

144
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,542
Never marrying. Yes. Dying
alone, that is very scary.

145
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,588
And how are you, Toby?

146
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,548
So great.

147
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,181
Oh, I put those up. I
know. I'm taking them down.

148
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,769
I almost wonder if
putting nothing on this wall

149
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,022
is more Halloween-y.

150
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't know
about this, guys.

151
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,942
Andy put me in charge of
the Halloween party, so.

152
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,362
Well, Andy sent us
in here, so which is it?

153
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,155
Oh.

154
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,950
So can we speak our minds now?
Or are we still sparing feelings?

155
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,244
Because I hate
all of this.

156
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,916
Very low pressure
in the Sargasso Sea.

157
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,126
Warm air from South America.

158
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,005
Cold air from Greenland. All
signs point to the perfect storm.

159
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,257
Perfectly mediocre.

160
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,550
What are you, anyway?

161
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,428
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman.
Leave me alone, ghoul.

162
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,139
If you had some really big
wings with blades on the end,

163
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,767
you'd kind of look like
Kerrigan from StarCraft.

164
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,354
Damn it! I am Kerrigan from
StarCraft. I've been censored.

165
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,940
If you're going to be a
Zerg, at least be a lurker.

166
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,193
Not some girl. Kerrigan
is ruler of the Zerg swarm.

167
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,780
Yeah. She also has boobs.
Yeah, but no nipples.

168
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,119
Hey, what's up?

169
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,956
November's sure creeping up,
ain't it? You can't stop that month.

170
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,296
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and
Phyllis helping with the party, you know?

171
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,425
Um...

172
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,719
I just thought you could
use some help, you know?

173
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,097
"Cause Robert came in and
thought the party seemed a little kiddy.

174
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,100
And I guess I agreed.
And maybe we could

175
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,562
mix a little more 13
into the PG.

176
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,817
But that's it?

177
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,445
There's nothing
about me or I?

178
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,199
Can we talk about it
at the end of the day?

179
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,161
I got a call.
I got to make a call.

180
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,122
Yeah, sorry.
Yes, we can.

181
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,551
Yes. I don't know.

182
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,344
Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,265
Gabe?
Sweet Erin.

184
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,018
I'm throwing the Halloween party
and I just want to amp it up a little.

185
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,104
I think it could use
some extra pizzazz.

186
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,148
Okay. Where does
Gabe factor in?

187
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,567
Remember that Halloween
party you took me to once?

188
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,279
The one where I started crying
as soon as I walked in

189
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,157
and I didn't stop crying?
Yes. Lars and Takako's.

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,869
Okay, well let's say that I
wanted this party to be a tiny,

191
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,163
tiny bit like that one,

192
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,585
just more adult,
more scary and sexy.

193
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,629
I will make this sexier
than you could ever imagine.

194
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,257
No, just scary. If we
wanted ideas for scary stuff.

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,642
No, that'd be scary.
What are you thinking about?

196
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,561
All right, let me go get it.

197
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,609
Pam Halpert.
Hey. It's Jim Halpert.

198
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,320
I was wondering if you
wanted to see a movie tonight

199
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,906
'cause I've read a lot about
this really great documentary.

200
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,826
Is it called Ghostbusters?
It's called Ghostbusters.

201
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,411
It didn't look like that.

202
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,330
He didn't have
a buster sign around him?

203
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,707
Why don't you draw him?
Why don't we see this old man?

204
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,085
Okay. Yeah. Fine,
I'll draw him. Okay.

205
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,547
I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

206
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,092
Whoa.

207
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
Mm-hmm.

208
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,555
Dwight, are you eating
a stick? It's a root, idiot.

209
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,931
Okay.

210
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,102
Everyone hates you.
That's really rude.

211
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,771
I don't tell you hurricanes
suck even though it's true.

212
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,024
What do you like,
tornadoes? Try influenza.

213
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,694
Yeah? What's the vaccine you
could take to avoid a hurricane?

214
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,030
Open up a newspaper.
Look, a hurricane's coming.

215
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,950
I suppose you're going to tell
me the scariest animal is a shark.

216
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,535
Try box jellyfish.

217
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,874
What are we talking about?

218
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,376
I was talking about my wife
and how she believes in ghosts.

219
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,880
Then we had a little debate and then
Meredith said that she believes in them too.

220
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,382
You seem unimpressed.
Ghosts don't scare you?

221
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:01,846
I'm only scared of real things,
like serial killers and kidnappers.

222
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,474
Not things that don't exist
like ghosts or mummies.

223
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,352
Mummies are real. There
are mummies at museums.

224
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,479
Yeah.

225
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,273
You prank.

226
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,442
It's true. They've
been preserved for

227
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,904
thousands of years.
They're all over.

228
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,994
Why on Earth would a
museum put a mummy in it?

229
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,461
A little
witch's brew?

230
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,172
I grew this party
up real fast.

231
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,258
Get out of here, little kid
party. Nobody loves you.

232
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,095
And clean up your room!
Grownups are going to use it later.

233
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,182
The party looks fun,
doesn't it?

234
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,018
Everybody seems to be in
there having a great time.

235
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,229
So maybe now would be a great time
for me to pop back on the computer.

236
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,149
I'm using it. I'm about to
play StarCraft with him.

237
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,403
You serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.

238
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,572
Hey, hey. That's funny.

239
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,700
Okay.
Loser.

240
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,288
Pam, do you think anyone's going to
notice I've worn this costume before

241
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,165
when I wasn't pregnant?

242
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,793
You know, I guess nobody
would believe it still fits.

243
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,966
Hey, guys, I'm
an Oscar Liar Weiner.

244
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,717
Oh, my God.

245
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,971
Party's tight, E.
Fog is cool. Thanks.

246
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,847
It's on medium.
Perfect.

247
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,725
It really looks great.
You did a great job.

248
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,561
Oh. So we don't have
to have that talk?

249
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,480
We should still
have that talk.

250
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,066
Maybe you could come
by my office at like 4:457?

251
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,944
Cool.

252
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,863
Okay.

253
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,366
Okay, everybody,

254
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,495
be prepared
to be scared.

255
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,580
Okay.

256
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,102
The Cinema of the
Unsettling is a growing film movement.

257
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,480
The most well known film in
the genre is an hour long shot

258
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
of a squirrel
with diarrhea.

259
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,614
Okay. Ew.

260
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,827
Is that my grandmother?

261
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,538
- What's the story?
- There is no story.

262
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,582
Yeah, seems like
there isn't a narrative.

263
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,044
Maybe the filmmaker realized
that even narrative is comforting.

264
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,547
What the hell
is going on here?

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,715
Okay, I think
we've seen enough.

266
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,800
- You can turn it off now.
- Yeah.

267
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,970
Yeah, Kill it. Go ahead
and turn it off.

268
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,722
Thank you. STANLEY:
How'd you get in my car?

269
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,640
Where is this from?
That is so upsetting.

270
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,894
That was awful.
Robert, I apologize.

271
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,647
I'm sorry. I got confused.
I heard that you

272
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,069
wanted to make the party more
adult but, I think I know what to do now.

273
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,781
This game is called
"Pecker Poker."

274
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,826
It's the
game of cards that gets you hard.

275
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,499
What we have here is a
classic misunderstanding.

276
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,502
Why didn't you simply
ask Andy to clarify?

277
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,421
Asking is a very
easy thing to do.

278
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,007
The two of you are
obviously very close.

279
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,683
Oh, I see. This no longer
seems like my business.

280
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,191
All I knew is that

281
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,568
you wanted to have a talk
with me at the end of the day

282
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,112
and I got nervous, so...

283
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,739
You were going
to talk at the end of...

284
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,907
I'm not here.

285
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,370
Did you think I was
going to fire you?

286
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,164
No, I wasn't.

287
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,211
I'm sorry. This must be
really uncomfortable for you.

288
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm never uncomfortable.

289
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
Okay.

290
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,553
Erin, I think you know
I've been dating someone.

291
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,013
Sure.

292
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,266
And it's getting
a little more serious.

293
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,894
She's never come by, so.
And she's never called here.

294
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,647
Unless it's your mom.

295
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,985
No, I didn't want her to call because
I thought it would be weird, but,

296
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,987
now it's weird
that she's not calling.

297
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,072
Two dates?

298
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,616
Three dates?

299
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,577
Thirty-one.

300
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,246
Wow.

301
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,666
I'm so happy
for you guys.

302
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,585
Um. Let me know
when you get to 40.

303
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,754
I'll see you guys.

304
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,259
I should go.

305
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,638
I just don't get it, Pam.

306
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,515
I mean, you're a rational
person. Thank you.

307
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,101
Jim doesn't let me wash his
NFL jersey during the playoffs.

308
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,604
How is this any less
logical? Careful. Whoa.

309
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,149
First of all, it's not like I think
that's going to help the Eagles win.

310
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,567
Really?

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,403
That is just a bunch of people
participating in a collective thing.

312
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,698
And maybe the Eagles will hear about
it and want to play better. It's not...

313
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,033
Exactly.
Thank you.

314
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,409
Go! Get up there
right now.

315
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,869
Got it.
Dwight.

316
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,121
You want to attack, or let
them come to us? Your call, B.

317
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,373
- Unleash the hell storm.
- Dwight.

318
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,292
Nice.
Dwight.

319
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,585
Got 'em. Go!

320
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,423
Is she Asian? I don't know.
She's from somewhere, I bet.

321
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,718
Maybe from the forest.
Forest?

322
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,595
Did Andy say his girlfriend's
from the forest?

323
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,264
I don't know, Phyllis.
Maybe she's from the city.

324
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,147
Looks terribly real,
doesn't it, Creed?

325
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,900
Are you scared of snakes?
No.

326
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,360
You don't live
as long as I have

327
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,403
without a healthy fear
of snakes, Bobby.

328
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,909
Yeah, I guess sometimes I have
nightmares about being buried alive.

329
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,829
Honestly, Jim gives
me the creeps.

330
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,791
What am I up to?

331
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,294
Like a few years
down the road, Cece says,

332
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,588
"Mom, there's
a ghost in my closet."

333
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,841
Now you say one of two things.
One, "You're just having a bad dream."

334
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,760
Or two, "Let's go see
what it wants."

335
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,595
I'm not going
to freak her out, Jim.

336
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,430
Okay. I'm not going
to lie to her either.

337
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,558
Oh, come on.
When I was a boy,

338
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:27,189
there was an empty house,
just up the hill from my family's.

339
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,484
It was rumored a man
committed suicide there

340
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,070
after being possessed
by the devil.

341
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,365
One day, a young woman, Lydia,

342
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,451
moved into the house
with her infant child.

343
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:45,082
That very night Lydia was awakened
by a loud, heinous hissing sound.

344
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:52,214
She walked to the nursery and
there in baby's crib was a snake

345
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,508
wrapped around baby's neck,

346
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,969
squeezing tighter and tighter.

347
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,055
Oh, my goodness.
The crib was full of dirt,

348
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,267
baby struggled to free
itself from underneath,

349
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,271
reaching and clawing,
gasping for air.

350
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,775
Embalmed bodies rose
from their sarcophagi,

351
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,819
lurching toward baby.

352
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,657
For they were mummies.
No.

353
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,784
Amongst them was a man.

354
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,288
Tall, slim.
Jim.

355
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,916
Almost instinctively
she turned to her husband.

356
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,002
"Wait," she thought,

357
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,465
"I don't have a husband."

358
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,678
For Lydia and her husband had had
an argument, one they couldn't get past.

359
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:44,516
Each night they slept one inch
farther apart until one night Lydia left.

360
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,979
It was about this time she
lost herself in imaginary worlds.

361
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,483
She had quit the
book club, the choir,

362
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,736
citing something about
their high expectations.

363
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,490
Her lips slowly
grew together from disuse.

364
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,117
Every time she wanted
to act, and didn't,

365
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,537
another part of her face
hardened until it was stone.

366
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,291
And that fevered night,
she rushed to the nursery,

367
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,878
and threw open the door.
"Baby, are you okay?"

368
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,964
Baby sat up slowly,

369
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,052
turned to mother

370
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,178
and said,

371
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,559
"I'm fine, bitch. I'm fine."

372
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,988
Fear plays an interesting
role in our lives.

373
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,283
How dare we let
it motivate us?

374
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,038
How dare we let it into our
decision making? Into our livelihoods.

375
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,165
Into our relationships.

376
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:56,255
It's funny, isn't it? We take a day a year
to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.

377
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,553
Toby. Hey, Bert.
Want to see the dance?

378
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,430
Dem bones,
dem bones, dem dry...

379
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,597
You're fired.

380
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,725
What?
You heard me.

381
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,852
Pack your things.

382
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,148
What? You can't...
Gabe? Are you...

383
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,275
I'm the CEO's son.

384
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,694
Pack your things.
You're done.
