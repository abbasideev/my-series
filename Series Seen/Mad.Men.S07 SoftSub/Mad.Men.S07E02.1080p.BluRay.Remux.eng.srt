1
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,286
- Evening, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Dawn.

2
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,286
- Let me take your coat.
- It's 8:00. Do you mind?

3
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,885
What is this?

4
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,327
Sweet'N Low and Coffee-Mate.
I noticed you were out.

5
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,051
Is this an elaborate plea for coffee?
I can make some.

6
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,043
I really can't stay.

7
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,203
Mrs. Draper did not
call this morning,

8
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,283
but I arranged for a Valentine
bouquet to arrive

9
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,086
in the afternoon her time,
so I'd expect a call here around dinner.

10
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,890
Good girl.

11
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,088
Mohawk Airlines?
Henry Lammott came in?

12
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,681
He just dropped in.
He wanted to meet Lou.

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,320
Huh.
Office or conference room?

14
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,608
- Conference room.
- Where did he sit?

15
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,649
- Who?
- Lou.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,768
I don't remember.

17
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,649
How did Diners Club
go on Tuesday?

18
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,201
It got pushed back for
a signing meeting with Handi-Wrap.

19
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,966
More Dow?
How long has that been going on?

20
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,884
I don't know.
It's Mr. Cosgrove.

21
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,644
Clara's terrible with memos.

22
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,571
- What creative team is on it?
- I don't know.

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,967
- No other calls?
- No, Mr. Draper.

24
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,249
I know, I know.
I told you, it's for carfare.

25
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,683
Well, I've been thinking
about it a lot, actually.

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,286
And you know I don't mind
keeping you aware of things.

27
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
But there's something about the money
that makes it feel wrong.

28
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,367
You're doing extra work.
You should get extra pay.

29
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,443
It's no work at all.

30
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,763
So I will continue to do
what I feel comfortable doing for free,

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,809
which is answer your phone
and keep you up to date.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,525
That's all I ask for.

33
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,604
No, you asked me to get you
photocopies of the Butler work

34
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,524
and they're locked
in Peggy's office and I can't.

35
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,045
I don't want you to do that.

36
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,929
All right.
Good.

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,048
But I want you to take this.

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,802
- You take care.
- Of course.

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,327
The cleaning woman
comes tomorrow morning.

40
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,971
She says, "You look
like a working girl."

41
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,726
And I thought she meant I looked
low-class like a secretary.

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,167
But Petra said
she meant a prostitute.

43
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,210
How the fuck does my mother know
what a prostitute looks like?

44
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,805
How was Sarah?

45
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,247
Below average.

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,289
She wants me
to bring her Capezios,

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,528
so I don't know
what I'm going to wear.

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,081
Is it an open casket?

49
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,288
I didn't ask.

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,444
Sergeant Snorkel says we have
to come back on the 12:30.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,887
So back here by 3:00?

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,530
The funeral's at 9:00.

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,330
We see Sarah, boo-hoo.

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,609
Maybe we leave a little early
because Sally's so upset.

55
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,762
We get in a taxi to the cemetery,

56
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,042
but we get out
in Greenwich Village.

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,931
Two hours of shopping,
take another pumpkin to Grand Central.

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,448
There's a boutique on MacDougal
that has Pocahontas boots.

59
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,967
I am upset, Carol.

60
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,249
Me, too.
I heard her dad's a mess.

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,687
She was supposed to be
a great beauty.

62
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,801
Sarah had this picture of her
wearing a bikini on Christmas.

63
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,122
She took it with her.

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,331
You know she's gonna
miss school till Easter?

65
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,403
I wish my mom was dead.

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,087
I'd stay here till 1975 if I could
get Betty in the ground.

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,765
What are you wearing?

68
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,127
I don't have anything black
but my turtleneck,

69
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,602
so I thought I'd wear that with
my brown suede skirt and black tights.

70
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,650
Jesus, Draper.
Is this your first funeral?

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,370
Leave the lights off.

72
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,409
How am I gonna find anything?

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,924
Why do you have
to do this tonight?

74
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,967
- Hey.
- Didn't you already sign Chevy?

75
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,004
Can't you just add the business
onto their other contract?

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,329
Sweetheart, let me
explain this to you.

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,041
This is the Southern California
Chevrolet Dealers Association.

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,170
Chevy's the factory,
this is the store.

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,642
You're not listening to me.

80
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,487
Just has to be there
when he wakes up.

81
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,211
He's so drunk, he doesn't
even know where he is.

82
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,970
That's why it has to be there
when he wakes up

83
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,121
with a note that says,

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,721
"You promised to sign this
no matter what."

85
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,682
You are such a big deal.

86
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,005
How'd it go?

87
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,406
- I got 'em.
- Good work.

88
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,040
- Good night, Bonnie.
- Good night.

89
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,362
Hold that, please.

90
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,164
- Hello, New York.
- Howdy.

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,681
Oh, Michael,
very nice work on Butler.

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,683
Stan, we're going to need
renderings, color.

93
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,330
- How's Monday?
- Today is Friday.

94
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,245
Whew, I'm buried all day
and I have plans tonight.

95
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,562
So you can finish tonight
and have plans all weekend.

96
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,563
- She's gonna find out.
- What?

97
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,965
Maybe if you invite me,
you can have till Tuesday.

98
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,442
We now all know you don't have
plans for Valentine's Day.

99
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,449
Oh.

100
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,688
She has plans.
Look at her calendar.

101
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,650
"February 14,
masturbate gloomily."

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,802
Monday is fine.

103
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,167
Who are these from?

104
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,891
Hard to believe
your cat has the money.

105
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,083
Really lovely.

106
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,722
Look at you, every inch a girl.

107
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,046
Is this some kind of joke?

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,567
Just tell me now because I don't want
to have to fire you later.

109
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,042
Enjoy your flowers, boss.

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,770
Oh.

111
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,922
Happy Valentine's Day, Shirley.

112
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,811
And happy
Valentine's Day to you.

113
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,328
Shirley, I see there's no card,

114
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,643
but I'd like to know who sent me
these beautiful flowers.

115
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,529
Well, actually...

116
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,489
Oh.

117
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,882
Oh.

118
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,405
I understand now.

119
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,528
Oh, good.

120
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,563
Could you get me some coffee?

121
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,364
What time is it on the coast?

122
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,409
- Pardon?
- 6:00 a.m.

123
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,531
I'll handle it.

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,251
Could you get the door?

125
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,251
Ted Chaough's office.

126
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,686
Good morning, Moira.
It's Peggy.

127
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,921
Where are you?

128
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm in my office, but I need you
to relay a message to Ted for me.

129
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,724
Oh, okay.

130
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,849
Tell him that I got his message.

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,324
No, tell him that
I relayed his message

132
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,962
to the client and...

133
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,287
And what?

134
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,920
There's nothing he can do.

135
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,525
They're not...

136
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,444
they don't want to hear
any more pitches.

137
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,489
The business is gone.

138
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,721
Really?
What account?

139
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,644
He'll know.

140
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,686
Well, the snow's melted,
but not the hearts of New Yorkers.

141
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,763
I just had some old lady
call me a "kike."

142
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,883
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,451
She was letting
her dog relieve himself

144
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,329
and I said, "Pardon me,
but you want to curb that thing?"

145
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,608
She says, "Mind
your own business, kike."

146
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,280
Maybe it's the hat.

147
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,442
The strangest things
happen to you.

148
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,041
Hey, did you see this?

149
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,441
Ogilvy signed Hershey.

150
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,090
I hadn't heard that.

151
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,447
She hates her because
she got a C in Western Civ.

152
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,090
She corrects my English.

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,089
I went to school in England.

154
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,643
Are we going to walk
into school with these?

155
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,564
We'll say they're Sarah's.

156
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,767
Is my purse in your bag?

157
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,681
The senior class sent her flowers
because they're all so concerned.

158
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,962
Half of them think
her name is Sally.

159
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,771
Shit, I must have left it
at the coffee shop.

160
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,321
Maybe in the head shop?

161
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,050
I'm just going to go up
and check at the counter.

162
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,487
- I'll get your fare.
- No, my address book is in there.

163
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,642
- It's everybody I know.
- We can't wait.

164
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,167
There's another train
in a couple hours.

165
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,004
- "Hello, Dawn."
- "Hello, Shirley."

166
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,931
You shouldn't be taking a break
right where you are.

167
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,602
I'm not. I'm getting her coffee.
And I'm taking my time.

168
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,684
- What did she do now?
- It ain't funny.

169
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,605
Charles sent me 12 long-stem roses
in a crystal vase

170
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,683
and she took 'em.

171
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,042
I was right at the photocopier
when she came in

172
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,690
preparing her shit,
and somehow...

173
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,245
'cause I put the card
in my purse,

174
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,209
I guess because it said,
"I love you so"...

175
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,566
she thought they were hers.

176
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,286
Well, it was an honest mistake.

177
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,204
Who the hell
is sending her flowers?

178
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,684
Why didn't you say something?

179
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,002
It was too late.
I tried.

180
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,646
- You tried?
- I really did.

181
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,406
Well, they're hers now.

182
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,641
I'm gonna tell her.

183
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,007
You want those flowers so bad,

184
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,924
you'll take the trouble that comes
with getting them back?

185
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,447
It's not right.

186
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,843
Well, I have two bosses

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,402
and one of them hasn't told
his wife he's on leave.

188
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,364
Keep pretending.

189
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,403
That's your job.

190
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,728
Well, you know who I feel
the worst for is Charles.

191
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,564
He'd rather you have a job.

192
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,563
You know that's not true.

193
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,602
"Happy Valentine's, Dawn."

194
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,842
"Good-bye, Shirley."

195
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,444
You look good. Rested.

196
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,126
You said that.
How do I usually look?

197
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,965
It's just that you've been so busy
for the last two years,

198
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,929
you've never
taken me up for lunch.

199
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,048
I figured you're on
some kind of break.

200
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,441
Maybe I'm doing research.

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,365
Maybe I want our place to be a little
bit more like Wells Rich Greene.

202
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,648
You'd have to have Mary.

203
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,201
And, you know,
you probably could.

204
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,203
I knew you were gonna tell me
how great it is to work there,

205
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,727
but I didn't think
that's where you'd start.

206
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,125
So you looking to make a change?

207
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,810
I have a job.

208
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,964
And I have a contract
and a noncompete clause.

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,043
And I'm a partner.

210
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,250
Look, I don't know what the truth is
and I don't really care.

211
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,767
Someone said you were
dabbling in the LA office

212
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,490
or managing your wife's career.

213
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,720
People say things.

214
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,366
Well, then you probably
heard the one

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,650
where you pulled
a major boner in a meeting

216
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,083
and you cried or punched
somebody or something

217
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,811
and that they cut you loose.

218
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,691
I didn't know I was
gonna be interrogated

219
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,808
by the Hooterville
telephone operator.

220
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,644
So it's not true?

221
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,609
You're spoiling the mood.

222
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,161
How about for a second date,
we go see the Knicks?

223
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,725
Right on the floor.

224
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,247
Bradley's having
one hell of a season.

225
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,402
That's a good idea.

226
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,206
Hello?

227
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
Can I help you, sweetheart?

228
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,648
Who are you?

229
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,565
I'm Mr. Avery.
You looking for casting?

230
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,167
No, I'm looking for my dad,
Donald Draper.

231
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,407
Uh, well, he's not here.

232
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,008
Did he change offices?

233
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,686
Perfect.

234
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,168
Look, honey, he's not here.

235
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,891
He's probably at home.
You should call him.

236
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,849
You know how to get
an outside line?

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,485
Is Joan here?

238
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,763
That's a good idea.
Her office is right down there.

239
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,330
You know, I think
everybody's at lunch.

240
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,482
Have a nice day.

241
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,840
So she's sitting there
on the conference table

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,128
Indian-style
in a dress and boots

243
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,607
like some kind of perverted
kindergarten teacher

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,969
and she says,
"Well, thank you, Robert.

245
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,804
I know it's the best
you can do."

246
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,008
What did Bob do?

247
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,441
Accepted his death gracefully.

248
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,602
I see a sheep and a wolf.

249
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,569
But which is which?

250
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,768
- How are you, Don?
- Great.

251
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,930
Jim Hobart, Dave Wooster.

252
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,161
We know each other.

253
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,482
So, Dave, how come you'll have lunch
with Don and not with me?

254
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,120
'Cause this is social.
He's not trying to buy us.

255
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,601
Well, what are you
trying to do, Don?

256
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,205
Are you taking lunches now?

257
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,489
No, I'm just looking for love.

258
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,563
Well, on behalf of myself

259
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,848
and all the millionaires
at McCann Erickson,

260
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,004
we'd love a chance to tell you
how handsome you are.

261
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,845
Move along, Jim.

262
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,285
Tell Mary I picked up the check,
because I just did.

263
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,241
I don't have to crap
on McCann for you, do I?

264
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,210
I almost worked there.
Twice.

265
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,249
But you didn't.

266
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,288
Here, I want you to have these.

267
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,324
It smells like
an Italian funeral in there.

268
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,003
So then dessert finally
arrives and the ladies,

269
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,725
on cue, depart to the toilets.

270
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,406
And as we're standing,
Honeywell leans in and says,

271
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,688
"I like what I see."

272
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,208
Now, I thought he was making
a ribald comment about my date,

273
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,089
but he followed up by suggesting

274
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,810
we retire to the bar,
just the two of us.

275
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,042
Is this a partners' meeting

276
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,046
or the most tedious
wireless program I've ever heard?

277
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,680
What?

278
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,171
What did he say?

279
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,085
- We're on the edge of our seats.

280
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,766
- Hello, New York?
- He's saying get to it, Pete.

281
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,207
- Did you kiss the man or not?
- Fine.

282
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,290
Well, he didn't want to say it
in front of the boys from Detroit,

283
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,886
but he wants us
to handle his business.

284
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,930
He rules the SoCal dealerships
with an iron fist.

285
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,849
- That's great.
- Wonderful.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,480
- That's wonderful news.
- It is, isn't it?

287
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,688
They want us to start
on the summer sale.

288
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,171
Sign them right away.

289
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,049
Sit in his yard with a pen
if you have to.

290
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,440
Contract came with the milkman.

291
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,285
I'll get Bob Benson to fly in
from Detroit for the signing.

292
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,442
We don't want the tail
wagging the dog.

293
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,410
They're the Dealers Association.

294
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,289
They bill almost
as much as Chevy does.

295
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
They are the dog.

296
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,683
- He's right.
- Just a minute.

297
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,003
Chevy's our client
and they're our entree to GM,

298
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,811
which bills more than
everything on the planet.

299
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,928
I would tell Detroit
we've got this opportunity

300
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,366
and I would ask
for their blessing.

301
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,806
Look, when I brought in Chevy,

302
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,928
I got their very own
Mikey O'Brien laid.

303
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,845
Sorry, sweetheart.
And it wasn't easy. Sorry again.

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,810
Pete caught him.
Let Pete mount him.

305
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,724
Can we move on?

306
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,804
This phone call is already
eating into our fee.

307
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,287
Ted, weren't you there
when we signed Chevy?

308
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,681
Roger seems to have failed
to get a head count.

309
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,326
I don't see any reason
to keep score.

310
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,165
Gentlemen, this is good news.

311
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,402
And I have no problem
with flying to Detroit

312
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,131
and briefing Bob and all those...

313
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,681
I'll bring oranges.

314
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,571
Ted? Are you there?

315
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,324
Hello, California?

316
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,966
- Dee, can you hear us?
- Yes, I can.

317
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,044
Dee?

318
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,680
What's wrong with you?
I say up, you say down.

319
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,002
I'm surprised you're
disagreeing with me.

320
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,770
It's common sense.

321
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,490
I think they can't hear us.

322
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,369
We can hear you!

323
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,010
Pete can service the account,

324
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,924
but he will report
to our man in Detroit

325
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,447
where said parties
will be offered

326
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,045
the right of refusal.

327
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,010
I remember very clearly
when Don and I signed Chevy.

328
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,207
Don who?

329
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,284
Our collective ex-wife
who still receives alimony?

330
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,444
- Hang up.
- No.

331
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,926
This is a partners' meeting.

332
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,320
Let's poll the partners,
shall we?

333
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,409
- Aye.
- Aye what?

334
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,045
I agree with Jim.

335
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,008
Moira, fix the phone.

336
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,162
I feel caught off guard
by having a confrontation

337
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,681
over something
that seems rudimentary.

338
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,922
They never said which
of Peggy's accounts we lost.

339
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,407
Call me when you fix
the damn phone.

340
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,688
Let me try out there.

341
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,450
What difference could
that possibly make?

342
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,170
I thought we were gonna
get a new one of these.

343
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,004
And why the hell aren't
we in the conference room?

344
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,925
Do not go after him.

345
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,761
Moira, you can reach me
in my office.

346
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,363
Hello?

347
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,681
Marta?

348
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,764
Oh, I looked everywhere for you.

349
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,649
What are you doing here?

350
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,370
What happened?
Is everything okay?

351
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,602
Obviously not.

352
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,127
- Where were you?
- I was at the office.

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,089
What?

354
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,084
I wasn't feeling well.
I left early.

355
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,326
What happened?

356
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,641
Does your mother
know where you are?

357
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,207
What? No.

358
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,647
You're not supposed
to be off campus.

359
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,807
My roommate's mother died
and they let us go to the funeral,

360
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,167
but I lost my purse.

361
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,442
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

362
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,171
I just need money for the train.

363
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,288
And I guess I need
a note of excuse.

364
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,885
I'll drive you.

365
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,926
No, it's okay.
You're not feeling well.

366
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,730
I'll be fine.

367
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,082
You really don't have to.

368
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,288
It looks like you have
a lot of work to do.

369
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,001
Come on, it'll be nice.
We'll take a drive.

370
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,083
What's the note supposed to say?

371
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,446
What?

372
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,291
Sally, what do I say?

373
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,207
Just tell the truth.

374
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,481
Where the hell were you?

375
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,529
I was getting your perfume.

376
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,524
- Draper's daughter showed up.
- Sally was here?

377
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,682
I don't know her name.
She was looking for him.

378
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,842
My Lord.
What did you say?

379
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,805
I said he's probably at home.
It's not my problem.

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,126
I have to call him.

381
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,044
Call him?

382
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,441
You have to call him?
Okay.

383
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,331
Don't bother apologizing
to me, I guess.

384
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,291
I'm very sorry.

385
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,642
Want to go before we go?

386
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,450
I'm fine.

387
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,609
- Hello.
- It's Dawn.

388
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,886
And I'm really sorry.

389
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,405
I don't know what happened,

390
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,131
but Sally came into the office
and she talked to Lou.

391
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,687
- And what did he say?
- I don't know.

392
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,128
But I wanted you to know
that she might be on her way.

393
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,284
Okay.
Thank you, Dawn.

394
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,011
Do you have to stay?

395
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,527
No.

396
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,204
Let's go.

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,365
Hello, Dawn.

398
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,766
Lou said he wanted to see me.

399
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,968
Oh.

400
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,600
Lou, Joan's here to see you.

401
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,491
Actually, I need
to see the both of you.

402
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,442
Get the door.

403
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,481
When I generously agreed

404
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,644
to share Dawn here
with Don Draper,

405
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,922
it was for the purposes
of his correspondence

406
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,448
and incoming phone calls,
not cleaning up his messes.

407
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,450
One of those things
is very time-consuming.

408
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,802
- What happened?
- His daughter came by.

409
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,849
Why are we going
through all this?

410
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,001
I know you can't fire her.

411
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,810
Just move her to another part
of the building.

412
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,088
Lou, I will take care of this.

413
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,323
- What do you mean by that?
- I want my own girl.

414
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,484
- Come along, Dawn.
- In a minute.

415
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,041
Obviously I can say
anything I want.

416
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,571
But you don't want to.

417
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,849
I skipped my lunch
to buy your wife perfume.

418
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,406
If you had been thoughtful
enough to get her a gift

419
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,962
when I told you about it 10 days ago,
I would have been here.

420
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,249
Do you understand?
It's not my problem.

421
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,165
None of this has anything
to do with me.

422
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,561
I'm sorry if I said
the wrong thing.

423
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,605
Was that necessary?

424
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,683
When she comes back
from the ladies',

425
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,604
have her hand over the keys.

426
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,805
New York is on the line.

427
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,361
Do you have to put them
on the contraption?

428
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,682
It's just Mr. Sterling.

429
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,168
- This is Pete.
- It's Roger.

430
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,527
I appreciate you fighting for me.

431
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,967
Well, Jim pled his case

432
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,168
and we decided it's best
to keep the business,

433
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,209
but run it past Detroit.

434
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,966
- Which means Bob gets involved.
- What?

435
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,327
Jim and I had a meaningful
conversation...

436
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,006
I heard your conversation.
You're full of it.

437
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,321
That is just the kind of weakness

438
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,124
that got us in this position
to begin with.

439
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,851
Let me just go to Detroit.
I'm sure...

440
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,480
...something to do with Bob
or my feelings towards Bob,

441
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,721
but it really doesn't.

442
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,611
It's a chance for me to rectify
my status with those people.

443
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,491
And in the end, that's our
best route to new business.

444
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,005
He disconnected.

445
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,087
Why even bring in an account?

446
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,241
They're just gonna take it away.

447
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,124
Sometimes I think maybe I died

448
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,248
and I'm in some kind of...

449
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,529
I don't know if it's heaven
or hell or limbo.

450
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,603
But I don't seem to exist.

451
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,047
No one feels my existence.

452
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,931
Just cash the checks.
You're gonna die one day.

453
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,447
What you're supposed to say is,

454
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,490
"Hey, why don't we just start
our own agency?"

455
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,165
At least the goal would be clear.

456
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,288
I mean, what am I
working for here?

457
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,090
There's two offices.

458
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,924
Yours is only slightly
better than mine.

459
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,408
What am I supposed to do,
work my way up to your office?

460
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,641
You can have my office.

461
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,962
No, that is not the point.

462
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,768
Cutler sent you out here
because you're too moral.

463
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,888
He couldn't look you in
the face and be Machiavelli.

464
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,280
That's not why I'm here.

465
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,851
Why are you here?

466
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,809
All you do is answer
the phone and mope around.

467
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,803
You know what?

468
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,530
We're not talking anymore.

469
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,684
From now on, we'll both
pretend I'm in New York.

470
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,010
Joan wants us to switch desks.

471
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,401
Don't feel bad.
It's not your fault.

472
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,971
I know.

473
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,130
Don't be sore,
but I'm really happy.

474
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,167
I need a box.

475
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,527
She wants you
out front right now.

476
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,844
Okay.
Well, just a few things.

477
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,161
He takes it light
with two Sweet'N Lows.

478
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,800
Always put through his son Earl.

479
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,689
These three lines are Lou's

480
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,410
and this one is Mr. Draper's.

481
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,206
Maybe I should get a pencil.

482
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,446
You know what?

483
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,843
I'll have Mr. Draper's calls
come straight to me at reception.

484
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,202
How old was
your friend's mother?

485
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,202
She's not my friend.

486
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,727
She's my roommate.

487
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,051
Where was the funeral?

488
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,362
81st and Madison.

489
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,204
Where was she buried?

490
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,126
In Queens by the racetrack.

491
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,409
So you left your purse
at the cemetery?

492
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,609
I'm not sure.
That's why it's lost.

493
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,645
Why are you interrogating me?

494
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,041
Because I know
you went to my office.

495
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,050
So I find your story
a little suspicious.

496
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,401
My story?

497
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,085
There's some man in your office.

498
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,481
- We're not talking about me.
- Did you lose your job?

499
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,041
Why were you in the city?
I want to know this minute.

500
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,487
I don't have to tell you anything.

501
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,005
Just stop the car.

502
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,811
- I'm talking to you.
- You're yelling at me.

503
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,042
Why would you just let me
lie to you like that?

504
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,170
Because it's more embarrassing
for me to catch you in a lie

505
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,970
than it is for you to be lying.

506
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,691
So you just laid in wait
like your mother?

507
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,766
Do you know how hard it was
for me to go to your apartment?

508
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,048
I could have run
into that woman.

509
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,450
I could be in the elevator,
she could get in

510
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,921
and I'd have
to stand there smiling

511
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,129
wanting to vomit
while I smell her hairspray.

512
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,284
I'm sorry.

513
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,771
Please, stop.

514
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,530
I'm not stopping the car.

515
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,762
Stop talking.

516
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,163
News five minutes
sooner from WABC New York.

517
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,482
News at 55 and 25.

518
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,444
It's 29 degrees here in New York.

519
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,404
A chilly Valentine's evening to you.

520
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,647
I have to get gas.

521
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,802
The Los Angeles trial
of Sirhan Sirhan...

522
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,324
I have Dee for you.

523
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,809
Who the hell is Dee?

524
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,484
From the Los Angeles office.

525
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,768
She has Mr. Chaough
on the line.

526
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,645
You've got to be kidding me.
Tell him I'm busy.

527
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,802
Do you want me
to take a message?

528
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,207
No, I want you
to leave a message.

529
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,328
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

530
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,369
Tell her to tell Ted

531
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,000
that I have no intention
of talking to him today.

532
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,208
And that's it.
That's all I said.

533
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,089
Okay.

534
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,769
That's what she said.

535
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,444
You know what, Shirley?

536
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,285
I've been thinking about it
and I know it's silly,

537
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,602
but could you please
throw these flowers away?

538
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
Why?

539
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,009
I'm sorry, but they're cursed.

540
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,009
No, they're not.
They're beautiful.

541
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,050
Look, I should have
bought you flowers

542
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,521
out of respect,

543
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,648
not because of some holiday.

544
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,048
Are these some symbol
of how much we're loved?

545
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,771
- It's a joke.
- Please, don't.

546
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,967
I'll get you some new ones.

547
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,726
Please, those are my flowers.

548
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,370
They're from my fiancé.

549
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,803
- Since when?
- Since this morning.

550
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,565
Why didn't you tell me?

551
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,006
You didn't give me a chance.

552
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,242
I didn't give you a chance?

553
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,768
They've been sitting
in there all day.

554
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,651
- Now you're just embarrassing me.
- I didn't mean to.

555
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,245
You know what?
You should have never told me.

556
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,243
That would have been
a great gift.

557
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,562
Who cares about
your stupid flowers?

558
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
You have a ring on.
We all know that you're engaged.

559
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,089
You did not have
to embarrass me.

560
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,208
Grow up.

561
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,681
10:00 a.m.?
Thank you.

562
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,770
Come in.

563
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,531
I just wanted to say
I was on my way to the club

564
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,526
and I noticed there's been
a change in reception.

565
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,125
I had to shuffle the girls.

566
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,126
Well, I'm all for the national
advancement of colored people,

567
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,124
but I do not believe
they should advance

568
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,282
all the way to the front
of this office.

569
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,887
People can see her
from the elevator.

570
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,769
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,366
Do you want me to dismiss her
based on the color of her skin?

572
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,767
I said nothing of the kind.

573
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,366
I'm merely suggesting
a rearrangement

574
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,124
of your rearrangement.

575
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,731
Suggesting?

576
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,087
Requesting.

577
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,325
Hello?

578
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,641
- Bonnie?
- Pete?

579
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,280
Hello, Valentine.

580
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,046
What a pleasant surprise.

581
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,929
Did you come to see me work?

582
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,162
Because I wasn't
expecting you till 5:00.

583
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,368
There's been a change of plans.

584
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,602
You're going to be showing me
around your body

585
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,762
at a bungalow
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

586
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,890
The devil and his temptations.

587
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,611
I will be there at 5:15
unless I get an offer.

588
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,649
You have an offer.

589
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,965
I love my flowers.

590
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,088
And I love you.

591
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,409
But I also love the 15 strangers
who might buy this dump.

592
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,647
Well, excuse me if I don't see
the point right now.

593
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,565
I mean, I landed that whale
and New York just took it away.

594
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,529
And I realized if the system's
rigged against me,

595
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,125
I might as well enjoy myself.

596
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,361
I once sold a house
for $108,000.

597
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,127
Two weeks later, during escrow,
it burned down.

598
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,046
I had driven this Okie couple
around for a year.

599
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,168
Bought lunches,

600
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,891
looked at pictures
of their hideous children.

601
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,930
Do you know where Altadena is?

602
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,969
Might as well be Barstow.

603
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,441
I'd show up and have
to change my blouse

604
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,922
because the sweat stains
were meeting between my breasts.

605
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,725
I could have lived for months
on that commission.

606
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,962
And then it was all gone

607
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,600
because some asshole
barreling down Lake Avenue

608
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,650
threw his cigarette
out the window.

609
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,649
I'm sorry,
but it's not the same.

610
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,208
It's worse.
I'm in sales, too.

611
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,285
Not some housewife complaining
about getting oatmeal out of a carpet.

612
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,808
An act of God, Pete,

613
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,691
that's how you know
when things are really against you.

614
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,047
You don't seem
very upset about it.

615
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,850
'Cause that's the thrill.

616
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,369
Our fortunes
are in other people's hands

617
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,285
and we have to take them.

618
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,248
I want to chew you up
and spit you out.

619
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,404
Put the sign back.

620
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,971
You sure you don't want anything?

621
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,361
I told you, I'm not hungry.

622
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,280
How are your studies?

623
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,124
Spectacular.

624
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,210
Do you want a French fry?

625
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,767
They're cold.

626
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,689
Know what?
I'm gonna get some coffee.

627
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,449
I should probably
call my friends.

628
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,688
They're probably worried.

629
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,649
Want ice cream or something?

630
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,768
Did you even need gas?

631
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,925
I wanted to talk to you.

632
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,648
The reason I didn't tell you
I wasn't working

633
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,848
was because I didn't
want anyone to know.

634
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,365
Got it.

635
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,325
I didn't behave well.

636
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,369
I said the wrong things
to the wrong people

637
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,409
at the wrong time.

638
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,086
What did you say?

639
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,367
I told the truth about myself.

640
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,491
But it wasn't the right time... then.

641
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,723
So they made me
take some time off and...

642
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,807
I was ashamed.

643
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,043
What was the truth?

644
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,481
Nothing you don't know.

645
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,164
So what are you gonna do?

646
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,687
I don't know.

647
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,088
It's kind of up to them.

648
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,967
If you're not going to work,
why don't you stay with Megan?

649
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,689
Because I wanted
to be here to fix it.

650
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,162
How?

651
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,443
I don't know.

652
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,890
Do you still love Megan?

653
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,769
Of course I do.

654
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,490
You know I visit
every couple weeks.

655
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,244
I talk to her all the time.

656
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,848
Why don't you just tell her that you
don't want to move to California?

657
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,684
Go ahead.

658
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,611
- Can I get a Coke?
- Sure.

659
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,811
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- What do you want, Peggy?

660
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,009
Well, I'd like Shirley off my desk.

661
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,606
What?
What did she do?

662
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,206
There was an incident today

663
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,647
and I'm not comfortable
with her on my desk.

664
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,205
I shouldn't have to
tell you more than that.

665
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,091
- So just fire her.
- I didn't say that.

666
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,605
She can work anywhere
in the office you want.

667
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,165
I just want someone else.

668
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,765
Fine.

669
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,685
- You can share Moira.
- She hates me.

670
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,241
- Meredith.
- She has the mind of a child.

671
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,323
Damn it, Peggy!

672
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,806
Dawn can't work with Lou.

673
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,689
Neither of them
can work out front.

674
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,002
Scarlett and Harry
are practically married.

675
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,288
- What do you want me to do?
- Fix it!

676
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,442
All I know is that
today was a workday

677
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,364
and I didn't get anything done.

678
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,685
- What do you want?!
- I'm sorry.

679
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,490
Since the meeting was aborted,

680
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,120
I wanted to get some details
regarding Avon.

681
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,203
But perhaps now
is not a good time.

682
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,886
We're just having
some personnel issues.

683
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,608
I just realized

684
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,962
you have two jobs, don't you?

685
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,886
- I'm not complaining.
- Maybe you should.

686
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,804
What are the skills
required down here?

687
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,371
Organization?
Fortitude?

688
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,324
Lack of concern
for being unliked?

689
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,330
I suppose.

690
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,449
Well...

691
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,251
there's an office open upstairs.

692
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,166
It's for an account man,
not the head of personnel.

693
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,207
What do you mean?

694
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,408
Let me know what you decide.

695
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,450
We can talk about
Avon on Monday.

696
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,329
Good night.

697
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,929
- Hello?
- It's me.

698
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,844
Where the hell are you?

699
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,525
We've got you covered
till lights out.

700
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,165
Ankle Fat thinks
you're at a church somewhere

701
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,651
with Sarah crying
on your shoulder.

702
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,167
Thanks, but I'm with my dad.

703
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,810
He wrote me a note.

704
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,201
You're never going to believe
what happened on the train.

705
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,562
There was this creepy
salesman from Milford.

706
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,200
He's really old,
but he keeps smiling at us

707
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
and he wants to take us
to the smoker.

708
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,444
- Yolanda said...
- You know what, Carol?

709
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,809
- I should go.
- Well, we hid your booty.

710
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,009
Your sandals, they're in the back
of the closet next to your cleats.

711
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,367
So at least the trip
was worth it.

712
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,321
I'll see you later.
Bye.

713
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,849
What's this?

714
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,445
I sot you a patty melt.

715
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,404
Everything okay?

716
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,925
Mm-hmm.

717
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,407
I don't like
you going to funerals.

718
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,087
It was awful.

719
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,925
Sarah's mom was yellow.

720
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,600
She was wearing this wig.

721
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,529
I hate that you had to see that.

722
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,002
I only went
so I could go shopping.

723
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,685
I doubt that.

724
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,122
I don't know.

725
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,489
Life goes on.

726
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,527
I'm so many people.

727
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,090
Can you see the car from here?

728
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,966
Yes.

729
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,451
Good.

730
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,204
I want you to finish your meal.

731
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,283
I'm gonna go out to the car
and get it running.

732
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,204
Then you walk out.

733
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,646
We're not gonna pay.

734
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,762
Really?

735
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,001
Don't bother with the flowers.
Everyone's gone.

736
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,730
No, these are mine.

737
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,526
They're from my son.
Thank you, Roger.

738
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,889
Well, I bet he's gonna be pretty upset
if he sees you giving them away.

739
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,405
I'm not.

740
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,528
I'm taking them
to my new office.

741
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,051
Up here?

742
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,851
It was suggested that I move
now that I have some accounts.

743
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,604
Jim suggested it?

744
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,649
Do you disagree?

745
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,928
Does it matter?

746
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,080
Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.

747
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,248
Ah, hello.

748
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,289
Hello.

749
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,008
Apparently we're going to finish
that conference call on Monday.

750
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,242
That won't be necessary.

751
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,289
I set Pete straight.

752
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,841
Hmm, glad to hear it.

753
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,449
I'd hate to think of you
as an adversary.

754
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,687
I'd really hate that.

755
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,244
You sure I don't have to go in
and talk to anyone?

756
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,323
No, I have the note.

757
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,970
Happy Valentine's Day.
I love you.
