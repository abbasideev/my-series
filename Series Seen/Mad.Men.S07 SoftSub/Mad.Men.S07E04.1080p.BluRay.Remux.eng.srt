1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,089
Well, now, we have
three options...

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,130
Catalina, which includes a boat ride
one of us will enjoy,

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,851
Yosemite, which is
a very long drive,

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,004
or Palm Springs, which...

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,605
are you listening to me?

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,728
Don't look.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,291
Turn around.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,363
That man is staring at me.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,330
Well, I'm relieved that you weren't
looking for a better conversation.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,450
It's a little rude, but I'm fine.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,002
- What were you saying?
- Very well.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
What are you doing?

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,408
George?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,490
I didn't want to bother you.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,682
You're obviously here
on business.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,729
What?

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,405
No.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,206
Trudy and I are divorced...
getting divorced.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,567
I've relocated
to our West Coast office.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,371
George Payton, this is Bonnie,
my real estate agent.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,887
I wish you would stop
introducing me that way.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,929
Why?
It's good for business.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,969
Okay, what if I say,

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,249
"Bonnie, my girlfriend,
your real estate agent"?

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,209
- Nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,806
What brings you to L.A.?
There's no cough-and-cold season.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,241
- George works for Vicks.
- Oh.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,051
Actually, I left.
Please, sit.

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,684
I'm working for Burger Chef now.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,211
You can't be in
the hamburger business

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,646
without taking a swing
at Disneyland.

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,888
When did that happen?

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,883
Right after Tom's heart attack.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,804
I thought of you.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,531
- Tom who?
- Tom Vogel.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,887
He had a heart attack?

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,929
Who's that?

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,287
My father-in-law.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,845
I hadn't heard about that.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,401
He's fine.

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,005
Who knew he had a heart?

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,168
Yes, right.

43
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,607
You know we're putting
McCann in review.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,967
Be nice for us to work together
without old Tom in the way.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,730
Hm.

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,960
It would kill him.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,411
Do you want to join us?

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,722
How about I give you a call
when I get back to the home office?

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,404
Of course.

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,449
Have a wonderful evening.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,806
I love watching you work.

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,610
That was skillful.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,489
Those conversations
happen all the time.

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,802
Doesn't mean anything.

55
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,529
Accounts won't have to search
for a conversation starter

56
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,480
and creative will benefit
from accurate data.

57
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,644
Ahem, any questions?

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,405
Where are we supposed to work?

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,443
You all have offices.

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,801
Lloyd, from LeaseTech,
has informed us

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,009
that the footprint of the machine
was prohibitive.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,571
And then it occurred to us,

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,166
why not let every client
who sets foot in that door

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,204
know that this agency
has entered the future?

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,766
And please, we will try
and keep the construction

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,361
and installation process
as brief as possible,

67
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,921
but steer clear of the area
for your own safety.

68
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,650
You might want to wear shoes.

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,410
Thank you all.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,210
If you have any personal items
in the creative lounge,

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,930
please remove them immediately.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,243
Anything left behind at noon today
will be assumed garbage.

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,129
They're driving us underground.

74
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,169
You know Lou didn't fight
for our space.

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,561
He doesn't believe in creative
because he doesn't know how to do it.

76
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,529
Trust me, you're going
to use that computer

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,603
more than you use that lounge.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,250
Did he hear me?

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,731
Why were you late?
You know that's a no-no.

80
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,450
I wasn't late.
I didn't get a memo.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,761
I don't even know what's going on.

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,803
Well, we're getting a computer.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,445
It's going to do
lots of magical things,

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,364
like make Harry Crane
seem important.

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,807
This decision must have been made
at the partners' level.

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,961
It preceded you.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,248
You got a problem,
take it up with Cutler.

88
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,806
Think it's too early
to come in and celebrate

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,325
our technological advancement?

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,727
I think that's worse
than being late, isn't it?

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,644
You're right.
Good thinking.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,201
Maybe later, off campus.

93
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,322
Harry Crane took a huge dump,
and we got flushed down the toilet.

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,165
Ginsberg, don't you believe
in advertising?

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,288
That computer is the "Mona Lisa."

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,010
People pay entry
to the whole Louvre

97
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,208
just to walk by that thing.

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,408
This is what was unique
about this place.

99
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,207
I want the couch.

100
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,124
That is not going to fit
in our office.

101
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,725
Why don't we switch it
with the one in Lane's office?

102
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,325
Because that one's really good.

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,204
You mean Don's office?

104
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,284
Don! Will you take
the other end of this?

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,365
Okay.

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,203
You gotta hold your side
a little lower.

107
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm on the heavy side
of the seesaw right now.

108
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,842
A little to your right.

109
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,804
My right.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,684
Damn it, Ginsberg.
Put it back.

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,723
It's too big for our office.

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,251
Come on, Stan!
I wanna try!

113
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,925
The other one's full of farts.

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,204
You're on your own.

115
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,724
Let me put this in terms
the art department can understand...

116
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,644
they're trying to erase us!

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,650
But they can't erase this couch!

118
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,250
So, in addition
to the fruitful nature

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,004
of our previous
relationship at Vicks,

120
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,482
George is very excited
about our bicoastal presence.

121
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,645
Are we concerned about a conflict
with H. Salt Fish & Chips?

122
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
- Ted?
- H. Salt views themselves

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,727
as a specialty restaurant,
not fast food.

124
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,121
That's a joke, right?

125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,885
Pete, what did your friend
at Burger Chef say?

126
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,128
They're going to open
their thousandth store

127
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,169
and that's across 45 states.

128
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,402
George Payton knows
who his competition is

129
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,131
and he loves that we understand
the franchise game.

130
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,487
Well, Ted, you're the king
of fish and chips,

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,286
but I don't want you running
the team from out there.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,044
We're calling you home.

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,607
Sorry, Jim,
I'm not going anywhere.

134
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,888
I think we should put Peggy on it.

135
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,690
This is a national campaign.

136
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,604
It's almost three million
in billings.

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,171
The whole thing's
about the kitchen

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,362
and the cleanliness
and getting to the homemakers.

139
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,204
They'll want a woman.

140
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,604
Lou?

141
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,570
I think Peggy is the right choice.

142
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,203
Well, I'm glad we all agree
the client is going to love

143
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,682
having a woman's point of view...
or whatever Peggy counts as...

144
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,089
but is Don not even on the list?

145
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,004
I was thinking the same thing.

146
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,162
He's spent three weeks alone
in that cave,

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,845
and he hasn't clubbed
another ape yet.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,685
High praise indeed.
Lou?

149
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,725
Don's a very valuable
piece of talent.

150
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,370
He should be put
to work already.

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,527
Absolutely.

152
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,445
Good work all around.

153
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,410
That's what I always say,
this business is about relationships.

154
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,005
Bye-bye, boys.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,843
Dee, we're done.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,367
Let's see them give that
to Bob Benson.

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,204
We done here?

158
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,688
I thought we had
an understanding about Don.

159
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,882
There's nothing to be afraid of.

160
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,123
He's an exquisite copywriter,
if nothing else.

161
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,770
He's gonna implode.

162
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,366
That's a distinct possibility,
isn't it?

163
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,410
On the other hand,
you might get some good work.

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,206
Hey, spud.
Get over here.

165
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,962
- What's going on?
- We're playing hide-and-go-seek.

166
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,731
You hear that, Caroline?
Someone's hunting big game.

167
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,962
And someone's looking for you.

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,323
- Mommy here?
- No, Daddy and Nana.

169
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,481
They're in there.

170
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,563
Ellery and I are supposed
to go play.

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,961
See you later, alligator.

172
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,244
Mona, Brooks.

173
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,209
What a pleasant surprise.

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,683
- Margaret's run away.
- To where? Bergdorf's?

175
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,966
It's not a joke.

176
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,771
She's upstate with some sort
of religious cult.

177
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,445
- What?
- It's a commune.

178
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,045
You don't know that.

179
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,646
- What the hell happened?
- I can't get a straight story.

180
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,529
Because I don't know
why you need to know.

181
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,364
Apparently, she woke up
one morning

182
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,285
and got in a van with some hippies
that she barely knew.

183
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,885
She's only been gone a few days.

184
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,323
10. Brooks and I think it best
if you go up there and retrieve her.

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,811
The only reason I even told you

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,445
is because I need someone
to watch my son,

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,967
and I thought it best
it be family.

188
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,121
If you don't want to do it,

189
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,884
I've got a long list
of strangers I can pay.

190
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,008
You're upset.

191
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,730
You're not thinking right.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,810
We can't help you if you don't
tell us what happened.

193
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,124
Look, she hasn't
been herself lately

194
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,727
and we went to this marriage
encounter group.

195
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,564
You're kidding.

196
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,088
She wanted to, and I thought it would
be good for her to talk to people.

197
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,566
That's always a mistake.

198
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,085
Roger!

199
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,801
Brooks, sweetheart,

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,923
I don't mind watching
my grandson,

201
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,650
but it sounds like
you tried to stop her

202
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,290
and you obviously failed.

203
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,762
- A father is a powerful thing.
- What are you doing?

204
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,127
Of course, she'll watch him.
Let the man be a man.

205
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,650
I appreciate that, sir.
I'm gonna go say good-bye.

206
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,167
I'm telling him
that I'm joining her on vacation.

207
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,765
Good idea.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,207
What kind of a sales pitch was that?

209
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,528
- That was terrible.
- I agree with him.

210
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,524
She is off her rocker
and she has run away with,

211
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,762
from what I can glean,
more than one lover.

212
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,571
I only know one other person
who would do something like that.

213
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,721
How is this my fault?

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,487
Because she is a perverse child
who only thinks of herself.

215
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,051
Look, I know you're upset.

216
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,646
I am terribly worried.

217
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,404
It'll be fine.

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,804
Well, it was a variety show,

219
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,884
and it featured this computer
that was programming the variety acts.

220
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,724
And they had a lot
of psychedelic graphics.

221
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,450
It was obvious
that whoever did the sets

222
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,682
had never seen
the IBM 360, I can say.

223
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,241
Maybe I'll go buy a TV.
I can catch it.

224
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,686
You should get a TV,
but it got cancelled

225
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,126
11 minutes into the premiere.

226
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,090
Tim Conway plays a guy who's trying
to kill himself the whole show.

227
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,844
Probably to get out
of his contract.

228
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,405
Don Draper,
this is Lloyd Hawley.

229
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,244
- Lloyd's with LeaseTech.
- I saw you at the announcement.

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,084
And what do you do
around here, Don?

231
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,086
Oh, Don is, uh, a partner
and our creative director.

232
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,481
I thought Lou
was the creative director.

233
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,483
- We have two.
- We have three.

234
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,330
I mean, there's Ted, too.

235
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,765
You must have
a hell of a business right now.

236
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,921
We'll see.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,846
It's tough, because we both sell
IBM's product and compete with them.

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,721
Who's winning?
Who's replacing more humans?

239
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,888
Listen, I apologize
about your work area.

240
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,327
It wasn't my idea.

241
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,801
Look, I'm sorry you lost
your lunchroom.

242
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,361
- It's not symbolic.
- No, it's quite literal.

243
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,803
I'll talk to you later, Lloyd.
Some of us have work to do.

244
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,602
That's why I supervise
the installations.

245
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,922
There's always some kind of trouble.

246
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,809
Don't worry,
that goes back years.

247
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,089
Well, I go into businesses every day,
and it's been my experience

248
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,244
these machines can be a metaphor
for whatever's on people's minds.

249
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,765
Because they're afraid
of computers?

250
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,526
Yes. This machine
is frightening to people,

251
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,409
but it's made by people.

252
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,965
People aren't frightening?

253
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,009
It's not that.

254
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,640
It's more of a cosmic disturbance.

255
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,643
This machine is intimidating

256
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,451
because it contains
infinite quantities of information,

257
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,889
and that's threatening,
because human existence is finite.

258
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,045
But isn't it godlike
that we've mastered the infinite?

259
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,965
The IBM 360 can count
more stars in a day

260
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,088
than we can in a lifetime.

261
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,004
But what man laid on his back
counting stars

262
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,241
and thought about a number?

263
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,244
He probably thought about
going to the moon.

264
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,446
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd.
I should get back in there.

265
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,881
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,604
It's quite a view, isn't it?

267
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,411
I like to think of myself
as a leader, Peggy,

268
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,608
and that means
doling out discipline.

269
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,448
But it also means tempering it
with encouragement.

270
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,727
Which should I be prepared for?

271
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,689
I didn't hire you,
but I would have,

272
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,684
and I would've paid you
as befits your senior status.

273
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,006
I'm giving you $100 more a week.

274
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,486
I'm writing it
on this piece of paper

275
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,644
because I've found that
saying things around here...

276
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,690
is useless.

277
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,690
Well, I...

278
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,808
appreciate that.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,365
Very much.

280
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,124
Well, with it comes a mission.

281
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,726
I'm putting you in charge
of Burger Chef.

282
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,001
Really?

283
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,766
Carve out hours for whomever
you want on the team.

284
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,888
And Don.

285
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,010
- Don Draper?
- He's the one.

286
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,962
Thank you so much, Lou.

287
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,248
Knock 'em dead.

288
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,805
Have you told Don?

289
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,361
You're in charge, sweetheart.

290
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,362
- Is he in?
- He never leaves.

291
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,401
Marsha, can you bring Don
and Mathis to my office?

292
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,528
Certainly.

293
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,201
Come in.

294
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,170
Please don't eat that.
You're so trim.

295
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,730
- Anything else?
- Miss Olson would like to see you.

296
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,490
Send her in.

297
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,881
No, I'm to send you in.

298
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,845
Okay.

299
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,965
- You wanted to see me?
- Can I offer you something?

300
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,441
It was a long walk, but no.

301
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,841
I have what I think
is very good news.

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,240
I hope you'll see it that way.

303
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,925
Hey, Don.

304
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,129
I don't know if you've
heard the rumors,

305
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,046
but Pete Campbell has gotten us
a presentation with Burger Chef.

306
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,362
All I know is it's national fast food.

307
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,602
- They run a new spot every month.
- That's right.

308
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,330
But we have to win it first,

309
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,687
and that's why I wanted
you both on my team.

310
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,922
Congratulations.

311
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,560
Congratulations to you.

312
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,802
How long do we have?

313
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,611
I don't know yet, but I want
to get started right away.

314
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,843
I think 25 tags
should get the ball rolling.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,082
- I'll get right on it.
- Apiece.

316
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,044
That's 50 total
between the two of you.

317
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,403
- What's the strategy?
- Lou likes to start with the tags

318
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,483
and then sneak up on a strategy.

319
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,404
You'll get used to it.

320
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,410
Well, that'll do it.

321
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,210
- Thanks for thinking of me.
- I look forward to your work.

322
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,328
Monday.

323
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,850
- How was your weekend?
- Lonely.

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,731
- How was yours?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

325
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,491
Oh, I'm sorry.

326
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,802
You have a meeting
with Miss Olson,

327
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,248
and the Burger Chef
research came in.

328
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,483
- Is he in?
- Yes.

329
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,847
Good.

330
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,205
Oh, good.

331
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,606
Don't act like you
were looking for me.

332
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,125
I was looking for you.

333
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,288
I need coffee.
I didn't sleep last night.

334
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,965
Well, Mona called,

335
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,851
and I'm supposed
to read you this message.

336
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,764
"Hey, genius!
Brooks is in jail in Kingston."

337
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,525
From now on,
you don't listen to her,

338
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,205
you listen to me.

339
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,525
And what I really like
is no matter what you order,

340
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,131
they give you a side of spaghetti,

341
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,884
even if you order spaghetti.

342
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,246
What, Burger Chef does?

343
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,323
No, Vito's.

344
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,211
I can go get him.

345
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,083
Come in.

346
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,131
It's time for the meeting.

347
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,248
I can't make it.

348
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,402
Oh.

349
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,971
Do you want me
to turn in your tags?

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,326
Nope.

351
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,130
Okay.

352
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,042
He's not coming.

353
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,204
- What?
- That's what he said.

354
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,361
Is that right?

355
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,086
I guess he's not ready.

356
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,844
I mean, we did just get
the research.

357
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,129
I would really appreciate a chance
to beef these up, as it were.

358
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,971
I mean, if Don's going
to get more time...

359
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,124
Here's a better idea.

360
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,965
Why don't we move the meeting
to the end of the day,

361
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,640
and you give me what you've got now
plus 25 more?

362
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,171
That's going to be 50.

363
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,129
But now you have the research.

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,731
- Hey.
- Nothing works.

365
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,245
You need to calm down.

366
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,680
I don't want this turning
into "The Guiding Light"

367
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,841
the moment we get there.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,731
Ha. I'm worried,
but you're angry.

369
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,884
Don't lose your temper.
How much cash do you have?

370
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,929
Why don't you reach in
and check?

371
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,530
His bail is 180.

372
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,489
Let Brooks spend another day
in the slammer.

373
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,041
- He'll just get in the way.
- No, obviously.

374
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,123
I meant we should spring him
on the way back.

375
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,281
He's a bum.

376
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,965
If he wasn't a bum,
she wouldn't have left him.

377
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,441
She told him she was never
leaving that place

378
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,364
and that he and Ellery
could stay there.

379
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,931
What was he supposed to do?

380
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,730
He was supposed to get into a fight
with those hippies,

381
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,804
not some rednecks in a bar
three hours later.

382
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,689
It's my fault.

383
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,365
I always let her out of everything.

384
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,006
She only had one job
and that was to find a husband,

385
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,128
and she mucked it up.

386
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,884
You liked him.

387
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,010
I thought he was good enough
for the time being.

388
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,762
I wanted her to wait like I did.

389
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,242
You only waited
because I wasn't available.

390
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,482
Well, look how that worked out.

391
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,881
What was she supposed to think?

392
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,651
"Things are hard.
I'll just find another man."

393
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,086
That can't be it.

394
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,687
Oh, God, I hope
she's not a drug addict...

395
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,167
although they usually
stay in the city.

396
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,970
- How do you know that?
- "Life" magazine.

397
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,488
It's probably another man,
who probably has drugs.

398
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,728
You and me is not
such a bad example.

399
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,928
I mean, what psychiatrist
is Ellery going to be telling one day

400
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,570
about the weekend
his dad was in jail

401
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,848
and his mom was on a commune?

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,321
I'm sure you can recommend one.

403
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,290
You know, I haven't
seen her in a while,

404
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,809
because the last time I did,
she was so cruel and so serene.

405
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,566
She has been strange lately.

406
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
And a little bit philosophical?

407
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,083
Yes.

408
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,166
I thought she was finally happy.

409
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,242
Come in.

410
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,647
Sorry to bother you.

411
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,087
Do you have a light?
Mine crapped out on me.

412
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,770
The perils of technology.

413
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,366
It's 1969 and you're unable
to make fire.

414
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,522
Human error.
Forgot to fill it.

415
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,449
You're the only one here.
It's lunchtime.

416
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,011
I'm not hungry.

417
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,128
Probably have too much to do.

418
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,203
I'm not doing anything.

419
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,160
Look, I don't want to put you out,
but if you have a second...

420
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,289
I have an advertising question.

421
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,965
Hmm.

422
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,042
Go ahead.

423
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,807
Advertising... does it work?

424
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,803
On some people.

425
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,244
It helps to have a good product.

426
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,965
I'll tell you how great it is.

427
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,122
I started LeaseTech
with two old friends,

428
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,641
and six months later,
we have 19 new employees

429
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,246
and three new competitors.

430
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,243
Well, the first question is
how is what you're selling unique?

431
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,131
IBM's leases
are short and expensive

432
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,363
because they're always replacing
the equipment with the newest model.

433
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,284
Ours are cheaper
because we don't do that.

434
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,329
Don't yours become obsolete?

435
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,801
They all become
obsolete eventually.

436
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,361
The question is,
how long does that take?

437
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,002
IBM doesn't care because
they just sell new machines.

438
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,121
At this point, I usually ask,

439
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,362
"How did you get
into this business?"

440
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,530
Well, I was at IBM for a few years.

441
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,364
- I knew it.
- Yes.

442
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,091
And I saw that they have got
a great product,

443
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,930
but they don't trust it.

444
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,969
Now, I've worked
with these machines.

445
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,525
I know how resilient they are.

446
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,763
I don't want to find them
in a junkyard in two years.

447
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,691
So you're betting that they'll last
longer than even IBM thinks?

448
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,841
Yeah.

449
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,328
But the problem is,
so are a bunch of other companies.

450
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,608
But they don't have you,

451
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,962
and they don't advertise.

452
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,081
Very nice.

453
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,486
What's IBM like?

454
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,047
Oh, there you are.
I thought we were going to lunch.

455
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,844
Thanks for the light.
Pleasure to talk to you.

456
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,322
You were going to give me the name
of a good keypunch service.

457
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,849
- When's Roger back from lunch?
- He's gone for the day.

458
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,731
You got a second, Bert?

459
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,410
Of course.

460
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,246
LeaseTech...

461
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,926
the company we're leasing
the computer from... is a virgin.

462
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,570
And I think we should
prepare a presentation

463
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,081
while their guy is hanging around,
push him over the edge.

464
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,242
New business?

465
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,050
That whole industry is exploding.

466
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,851
This guy has exponential growth.

467
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,923
Have you forgotten
the stipulations?

468
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,491
Fine, tell somebody else.

469
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,369
I mean,
the apple is right there.

470
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,921
You have a fundamental
misunderstanding

471
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,401
of what went wrong here.

472
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,369
So, that's it?
You want me to be a janitor?

473
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,124
Whistle while I work?

474
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,363
You thought there was going to be
a big creative crisis

475
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,249
and we'd pull you off the bench,

476
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,688
but in fact,
we've been doing just fine.

477
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,531
So, why am I even here?
I could've gone anywhere.

478
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,445
- Why are you here?
- Because I started this agency!

479
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,649
Along with a dead man
whose office you now inhabit.

480
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,530
I left something in there.

481
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,329
When?

482
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,848
Thank you, Caroline.
I got it.

483
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,330
What are you doing?

484
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,490
Are you looking
to buy some jelly?

485
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,846
The stand's up the road.

486
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,571
No, we're looking
for Margaret Sterling.

487
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,802
Hargrove.
Margaret Hargrove.

488
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,246
I know who you're talking about.

489
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,721
Marigold!

490
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,168
She doesn't want any trouble,
and we don't want any trouble.

491
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,163
Nor do we.

492
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,163
These two are looking for you.

493
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,970
You know 'em?

494
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,805
Of course I do.

495
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,004
This is my mother and father.

496
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,010
- Mother, you look wonderful.
- Stop it.

497
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,571
I know why you're here,

498
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,491
and I just want to welcome you.

499
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,010
Margaret, darling, we just...

500
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,524
Could you call off your dogs?

501
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,808
I'd like to have
a private conversation.

502
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,008
Hey, everybody, I understand
the dry cleaning's ready,

503
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,690
but can you bring it back
in an hour?

504
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,444
There's 50 bucks in it for you.

505
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,843
I'm fine, everyone.
These are my parents.

506
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,687
Will you let me
show you around at least,

507
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,123
before you start railing against
something you don't understand?

508
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,521
I don't know what happened
between you and Brooks,

509
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,688
but your son misses you.

510
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,810
Things have never been better
between me and Brooks.

511
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,485
Even

512
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,086
And...

513
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,811
I miss Ellery so much.

514
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,644
I think about him all the time,

515
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,600
but he can't be happy
if I'm not happy.

516
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,570
I didn't know how dire it was,
but if you need money...

517
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,484
whatever you want,
whatever you need.

518
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,201
She doesn't want money.
Margaret, listen.

519
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,888
Sugarplum, these people
are lost and on drugs,

520
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,849
and they have venereal diseases.

521
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,331
That's not for you.

522
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,528
You don't know them.

523
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,089
And I'm tired of accepting
society's definition of me.

524
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,168
I don't pray to that anymore.

525
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,488
Darling, I understand.

526
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,768
Being a young mother
can be overwhelming,

527
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,445
even with help.

528
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,682
You sit with your child
at the end of the day

529
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,084
and you're exhausted
and you don't even know what you did.

530
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,681
And everything you do
seems wrong.

531
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,322
It's hard to accept that those
are the definitions, but they are.

532
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,687
I'm sorry you had
nothing to live for.

533
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,285
I did.

534
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,522
I had you, and I was grateful.

535
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,887
I'm grateful.

536
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,610
I don't have to lock myself
in a bathroom

537
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,564
with a pint of gin every day.

538
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,364
I ought to slap you.

539
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,931
Why are you talking
to your mother like that?

540
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,051
Daddy, I'm sorry.

541
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,363
I'm telling her the truth,
and she doesn't want to hear it.

542
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,722
Let's go!

543
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,725
You didn't even let me talk to her.

544
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,405
There's no more point in talking.

545
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,847
I'd think she was brainwashed,
but there's nothing to wash.

546
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
You can't make her turn on a dime.
You'll embarrass her.

547
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,405
Fine. You want to wine and dine
the account, Roger?

548
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,891
Knock yourself out.

549
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,368
There's a four-year-old in Manhattan
crying himself to sleep.

550
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,367
I'll get Cletus
to drive me to the train.

551
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,049
Marigold!

552
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,363
You want to show me around?

553
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,929
Hey, it's Don.

554
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,082
Look at that, I got you.

555
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,651
I didn't know where you'd be.

556
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,882
You're here, there, everywhere.

557
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,245
No, I'm not in the bag.
I'm in the office.

558
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,849
Listen, let's go to Shea.

559
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,120
Let's go see a game, I mean it.

560
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,487
Is there a game today?

561
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,166
You shouldn't have told me that,
because now we're really going.

562
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,849
Okay. Your wish is my command.
I will not move.

563
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,645
Can I hang up the phone?

564
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,526
When you're done with that,
one of us should find some firewood.

565
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,125
When he's done with that,
he's not going to be able

566
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,971
to find his ass with both hands.

567
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,323
I'll tell you what, Clay,
why don't we switch jobs?

568
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,847
You want to get firewood,
help yourself.

569
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,530
There's no hierarchy, man.

570
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,047
Believe me,
there's always a hierarchy.

571
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,885
We do things
by true consensus here.

572
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,726
If we can't all agree on something,
we think of something else.

573
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,041
Everyone does what they want.

574
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,690
Good.

575
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,365
Because I haven't felt
this at one with nature

576
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,800
since I was in the Navy.

577
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,050
Go ahead.
It's dynamite grass.

578
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,325
Now, I see why
we're eating so early.

579
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,644
No, it's because we follow
the cycles of the Earth.

580
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,325
It's gonna get dark.

581
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,604
Electricity and all that?

582
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,684
It just brings problems.

583
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,569
But you've got a truck.

584
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,564
Yeah.

585
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,087
That's been up for debate, man.

586
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,929
Doesn't it get cold up here?

587
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,082
We light a campfire.

588
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,766
And there's other ways
to keep warm.

589
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,125
It's all right, sweetheart.
He's expecting me.

590
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,368
Freddy,
what a pleasant surprise.

591
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,286
- You know you called me.
- I sure do.

592
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,602
- There's someone I want you to meet.
- Who?

593
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,730
I want you to...
♪ Meet the Mets ♪

594
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,120
Meet the Mets!

595
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,362
♪ Step right up
and greet the Mets. ♪

596
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,091
Great idea.
Can you walk?

597
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,770
Hello again.

598
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,968
Meredith, we're off for the day.

599
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,806
- Way off.
- Okay. You two have fun.

600
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,805
Where are you going?

601
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,567
Don, I didn't hear you.

602
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,404
No, I didn't hear you.

603
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,166
Come on, Don, we're gonna
miss the game.

604
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,002
You talk like a friend,
but you're not.

605
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,323
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

606
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,960
I know your name.

607
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,690
It's Lloyd.
I told you.

608
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,002
No, you go by many names.

609
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,845
I know who you are.

610
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,650
Don, let's go.

611
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,131
Why don't you listen to your friend?

612
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,169
You don't need a campaign.

613
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,647
You've had the best campaign
since the dawn of time.

614
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,002
Pull yourself together.

615
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,645
Freddy?

616
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,364
We're knocking off early.

617
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,285
- Okay.
- Ball game.

618
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,523
I just wanted to make sure you saw
the memo from the partners.

619
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,722
Your raise was approved.
Congratulations.

620
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,848
What?

621
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,328
Oh, yes. Thank you.
This office is so great.

622
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,488
Everyone can just drop by
on their way out.

623
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,881
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.

624
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,963
Joan!

625
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,169
I'm sorry.
I'm just having a day.

626
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,886
I have exactly two minutes.

627
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,690
It won't take that long.

628
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,286
You already know the problem.

629
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,283
Burger Chef's a big account,

630
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,204
but they obviously thought
you were ready for it.

631
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,408
They didn't want to give me
Burger Chef.

632
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,564
- They wanted to give me Don.
- What are you talking about?

633
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,324
You didn't hear?

634
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,403
Lou put Don on my team.

635
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,404
- To cowardice.
- Mine or theirs?

636
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,650
He owes me work,
and he's going to the ball game?

637
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,247
And there's nothing I can do,
and he knows that.

638
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,169
Have you told Lou?

639
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,160
You don't know this,
but there were rules set for Don.

640
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,931
- Is he breaking them?
- I don't know.

641
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,721
So, they just dropped it in my lap,

642
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,928
hoping one of us would fail.

643
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,047
Well, Peggy, I don't know
if this makes you feel better,

644
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,521
but I don't think they thought
about it at all.

645
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,643
I can't believe
my little "princess and the pea"

646
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,087
is sleeping like this.

647
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,561
You've never even wanted
to go camping.

648
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,609
Well...

649
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,124
I used to think
the country was lonely.

650
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,130
Now I realize the city is.

651
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,290
I mean, look at that.

652
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,445
It's beautiful.

653
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,648
You think we'll put
a man up there?

654
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,007
With all the brainpower
around here?

655
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,607
I'm certain you'll put
a man on the roof.

656
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,686
I'd like to go to the moon.

657
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,844
Well, I guess if you can make
an allowance for a truck,

658
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,162
you can make an allowance
for a rocket.

659
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,163
Don't you want to go?

660
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,004
Of course.

661
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,242
Every little boy
wants to be an astronaut.

662
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,364
Astronauts didn't exist
when you were a little boy.

663
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,841
Jules Verne...

664
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,002
"From the Earth to the Moon."

665
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,204
You read that to me.

666
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,647
They shot a cannon into space.

667
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,804
I don't think so.

668
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,764
Must've been your mother.

669
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,441
I'm really happy here, Daddy.

670
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,208
I know.

671
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,651
Oop, oop...

672
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,689
Get my binoculars.
They're in the hallway closet.

673
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,683
Good idea.

674
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,721
We're going to miss
the national anthem.

675
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,130
Stop it, not here.

676
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,490
Come on.

677
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,086
It's as black and strong
as Jack Johnson.

678
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,044
Thank you.

679
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,563
How'd you get in?

680
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,122
I'm glad you passed out.
I got a lot less to explain.

681
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,610
Did the Mets win?

682
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,484
What the hell are you doing?

683
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,165
Aren't they giving you
a second chance?

684
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,641
They weren't serious about it.

685
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,484
They finally gave me
something to do,

686
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,008
and it was write 25 tags
for Peggy.

687
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,369
- What's the account?
- Burger Chef.

688
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,329
Hm... Peggy.

689
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,164
Have you been
to the restaurant yet?

690
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,881
What, and have some pimply kid
who should be writing taglines

691
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,087
hand me a milk shake?

692
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,241
How would you rather have it?

693
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,164
Would you rather be
in my situation...

694
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,845
bouncing from office to office?

695
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,843
"Ding-dong,
Don Draper calling."

696
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,331
I want my job back.

697
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,965
How the hell do you think
that's going to happen

698
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,441
when you're at the bottom
of a bottle?

699
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,523
You know you never have to have
another drink again.

700
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,045
I don't want to hear that right now.

701
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,447
You're hungover.
It's the best time to hear it.

702
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,362
I mean, are you just going
to kill yourself?

703
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,682
Give them what they want?

704
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,684
Or go in your bedroom,
get in uniform,

705
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,844
fix your bayonet,
and hit the parade?

706
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,003
Do the work, Don.

707
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,244
You're up early.

708
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,169
Where's my daughter?

709
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,761
She's probably at the creek
getting water.

710
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,604
I don't think so.

711
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,804
It's a beautiful night
and a beautiful morning.

712
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,404
Did you see the sunrise?

713
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,482
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?

714
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,210
It's time to leave Shangri-La, baby.

715
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,681
Take a good look,
say good-bye to your friends.

716
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,723
You were doing so well, Daddy.

717
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,881
Fine, you don't want
to say good-bye?

718
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,930
- Let's go.
- Hey, man, leave her be.

719
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,686
Come on, Sprout, you feel like
driving the truck today?

720
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,650
No one's going to help you
take me away from here.

721
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,325
They know this is
where I want to be.

722
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,568
I don't care what you want
and I don't care what they want.

723
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,370
It's over.
Let's go.

724
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,921
I don't know why I assumed
you were more open-minded.

725
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,241
Well, I'm not.

726
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,811
I understand the temptation,

727
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,610
and I know everyone your age
is running away

728
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,285
and screwing around,
but you can't.

729
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,441
You're a mother.

730
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,809
- Ellery has everything he needs.
- He needs his mother.

731
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,082
I'm sorry, but you don't
get to do this!

732
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,288
Good-bye, Daddy.

733
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,802
Let me go!
Let me go right now!

734
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,328
How could you just leave him?

735
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,885
He's your baby.

736
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,284
How did you feel when you went
away to work, Daddy?

737
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,728
Your conscience must have been
eating you alive.

738
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,882
Calling your secretary
from a hotel

739
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,725
to pick out
a birthday present for me?

740
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,962
I'm sure you were sick.

741
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,567
It's not that hard, Daddy.

742
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,246
He'll be fine.

743
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,168
You sure you don't
want a Danish?

744
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,243
Nope.

745
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,401
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

746
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,365
Good morning.

747
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,529
I'll have your tags by lunch.

748
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,281
Great.
