1
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,235
I thought you were going to open it up.

2
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,694
I got a hell of a shaker on 130.

3
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,196
What are you afraid of?

4
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,490
- That was fast.
- Apparently not.

5
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,702
So, what do you think?
Can we go to El Mirage?

6
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,621
You and your record books.

7
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,915
You gotta take care of that shimmy.

8
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,251
You won't lose control, but I bet
it creates drag.

9
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,379
You know an awful lot about cars
for a guy who hasn't got one.

10
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,340
We just need a stake.

11
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,635
A couple hundred bucks for
a flatbed rig, some parts.

12
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,179
Beer and gas.

13
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,316
Drive from O'Hare Airport

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,611
to breakfast with Sears Roebuck
senior vice presidents.

15
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:57,659
Then, the Chicago Ad Club.
12:30 luncheon, 1:30 speech.

16
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,495
I translated your speech into Pig Latin.

17
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,872
That was a joke.

18
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,208
And?

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,962
And I've arranged for that package

20
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,923
to be delivered to your suite
at the Stanhope tomorrow.

21
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,383
What package?

22
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,886
The package from Canada
with all the luggage?

23
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,764
She knows about Marie.

24
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,433
She's Megan's mother.

25
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,228
I'm going to leave you two alone.

26
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,313
Do I have to?

27
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,522
Yes.

28
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,405
Sweetheart, I have some sad news.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,990
Is he dead?

30
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
Don? No.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,787
I don't think so.
I think we would have heard about that.

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,501
That said, our secret plan here
has been discovered.

33
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,504
They know I don't need two secretaries.
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,590
I really thought he'd be back by now.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,009
Well, I hope he's in a better place.

36
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,094
He's not dead. Stop saying that.

37
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,097
There are a lot of better places than here.

38
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,146
I'll give you the recommendation
he would have.

39
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,939
I know you'll land on your feet.

40
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,067
I always do.

41
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,365
So, that covers Del Monte, Roman Meal,

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,450
and Diamond Walnuts.

43
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,037
Bon appetit.
That is all the accounts, all assigned.

44
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,750
And don't ask me again about
S.O. Research and Engineering.

45
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,834
It's over.

46
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,006
Why did they take us off Chevalier?

47
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,550
Did Ted say anything to you about it?

48
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,554
Ted's not the creative director.
They moved it to David's group.

49
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,515
Does David know they took us off?

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,726
There's plenty to go around.

51
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,063
It's done. You have four good accounts.
Get to work.

52
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,232
Lorraine, do you have a moment?

53
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,900
Not really.

54
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,153
Why are we off Chevalier?

55
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
Because Stu Riley took over
from Pete Campbell

56
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,490
and he has his favorites.

57
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
I thought David wanted us on it.

58
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,452
I guess he didn't.

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,246
Well, does he know?

60
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,789
I don't know.

61
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,126
Why don't I call David
and let him know you're unhappy?

62
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,295
You know what, Lorraine?

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,298
Call David.

64
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,135
In fact, why don't we go over
and see him right now?

65
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,262
I'm sure he'd love to get involved.

66
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,684
Fine. You want it, you can have it.

67
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,146
Thanks so much.

68
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,578
You hung up my jeans.

69
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,705
I like having a man to take care of.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,543
My wallet didn't happen to fall out, did it?

71
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,087
What the hell does that mean?

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,256
Should I go look?

73
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,428
Maybe I wanted to know who you were.

74
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,346
Everybody thinks you're from Detroit,

75
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,515
come to steal their secrets.

76
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,392
Did you leave me anything?

77
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,480
You've never paid for it, huh?

78
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,822
I have and I will. I just like it to be voluntary.

79
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,784
Get your purse.

80
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,134
Could have asked me.

81
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,345
That's never worked.

82
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,517
Whose ring is that?

83
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,520
Weren't you gonna steal it?

84
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,774
Thank you.

85
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,367
We're leaving tomorrow.

86
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,703
You know we're going
to beat those postcards home.

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,664
I want them to say Key West.

88
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,672
Who gave you cocaine as a birthday present?

89
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,383
My old partner. It's all over Malibu.

90
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,596
We said we'd try everything.

91
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,391
Okay.

92
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,813
I think you're supposed
to sniff it off your fingernail.

93
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,199
Okay, my turn.

94
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,716
That's fast.

95
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,637
I feel like someone just gave me
some very good news.

96
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,976
You know, we could live like this all the time.

97
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,561
You just enjoy corrupting me.

98
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,729
Not the cocaine.

99
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,690
I'm talking about
taking advantage of all I have.

100
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,191
All you have.

101
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,485
You should be spoiled.

102
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,487
I couldn't be more spoiled.

103
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,406
The way I've been living in New York,

104
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,450
it's hard to tell when the vacation started.

105
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,786
Kevin's going to school soon,
so I know you have to be in one place,

106
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,206
but, if you think about it,
why does that place have to be New York?

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,959
There are good schools everywhere
and you hate your mother.

108
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,336
I don't hate her.

109
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,462
Is that all you heard?

110
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,881
You're cheating yourself. That tiny apartment.

111
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,550
I don't wanna make plans,
but we could get a place in the mountains

112
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,802
or the country.
Or a place in the mountains and the country.

113
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,304
Have you been looking for a place?

114
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,597
It's a hobby.

115
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,349
I mean I guess what I'm trying to say is

116
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,894
I want you to let yourself
have a future with me.

117
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,396
Do you wanna get married?

118
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,815
Sure. If you do.

119
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,610
But it seems to me, your life
is undeveloped property.

120
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,364
You can turn it into anything you want.
It's got a hell of a view.

121
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,908
Do we have to get married?

122
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,368
Hell, no.

123
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,995
I want you so much right now.

124
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,626
I'm sorry. I got held up.

125
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,628
No, I'm sorry.

126
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,507
Samsonite is shooting tomorrow
and they changed everything.

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,593
I feel horrible, but I'm afraid it's just
you and Harry for lunch.

128
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,512
That's my going away present?

129
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,055
What else did you get?

130
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,432
The account girls got a little sentimental.

131
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
Sarah baked cookies.

132
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,229
And this is a cactus.

133
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,064
What's that have to do with Kansas?

134
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,025
I don't know. Do you want it?
I have a five-year-old.

135
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,696
Let's go. I'm starving.

136
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,864
She's not coming. She has work to do.

137
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,949
Don't do that.

138
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,492
You know who I was gonna have lunch with?

139
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,910
Someone important?

140
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,204
Doesn't anything mean anything to you?

141
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,833
Here, this will hold you over.
I'll meet you by the elevator.

142
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,838
He acts like we're the Three Musketeers.

143
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,922
We've never had lunch.

144
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,302
I just wanted to say
that I'm very happy for you.

145
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,431
And everyone's going to miss you,

146
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,933
who doesn't hate you for getting that big job.

147
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,227
Well, you're doing fine.

148
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,980
Keep it up, you'll be
a creative director by 1980.

149
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,816
God, that sounds like a long time.

150
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,609
I'm telling you, it will happen.

151
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,403
They just have to get used to the idea.

152
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,489
Someday, people are gonna brag
that they worked with you.

153
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,327
What am I supposed to say to that?

154
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,330
I don't know. No one's ever said it to me.

155
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,709
A thing like that.

156
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,838
I'll be back.

157
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,549
That thing better be alive.

158
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,433
So, you're in Utah?

159
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,018
I sent you a clipping.

160
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,854
They broke the land speed record
right up in Bonneville.

161
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,526
622 miles an hour in
a car that looked like a jet.

162
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,113
Sally?

163
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,866
I'm glad you're having fun.

164
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,160
Sorry, I already went to high school.

165
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,204
I got to go.

166
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,371
Hold on.

167
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,831
What's wrong?

168
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,957
It's nothing.

169
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
Boy problems?

170
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,673
I'm not supposed to tell you.

171
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,425
What?

172
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,429
Mom's dying.

173
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,643
Look, your mother's a hypochondriac.
Don't go off the deep end.

174
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,561
Dad, listen to me.

175
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,565
She has lung cancer.
The doctors gave her six months to live.

176
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,029
What?

177
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,242
She doesn't want you to know,
but I just thought...

178
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,453
No, you did the right thing. I'm coming home.

179
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:06,999
No, I'm telling you because she wants
Gene and Bobby to live with Uncle William.

180
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,293
Don't worry, you're all going to live with me.
I promise.

181
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,547
Let me finish.
I've thought about this more than you have.

182
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,924
You have to tell her that

183
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,844
you think it's best that they stay with Henry.

184
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,011
No.

185
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,848
Daddy, it's going to be
so hard for them already.

186
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,393
They should at least be in the same bed
and at the same school.

187
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,311
Sally, grown-ups make these decisions.

188
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,565
Do you understand
I'm betraying her confidence?

189
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,153
I'm not being dramatic.
Now, please, take me seriously.

190
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,993
- I have to go.
- Hold on.

191
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,578
Please, I can't talk right now.

192
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,121
Sally, wait a minute.

193
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,144
Francis residence.

194
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,814
I have a person-to-person call
for Betty Francis

195
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,441
from Donald Draper.

196
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,109
This is she. I'll accept.

197
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,571
Hello, Don.

198
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,824
- Don't you want the boys?
- No.

199
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,368
You know I talked to Sally, don't you?

200
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,997
Yes, of course.

201
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,498
I'm coming home.

202
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,334
You are definitely not!

203
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,837
I want to be there. The kids need me.

204
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,839
I don't want to upset them.

205
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,008
It's my business.

206
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,428
I didn't even want her to know,

207
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,722
but no one can keep their mouth shut.

208
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,891
I don't want you to worry about them.

209
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,560
They'll going to come live with me.
You don't even have to ask.

210
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,562
I wasn't going to.

211
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,484
Please don't let your pride
interfere with my wishes.

212
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,694
I'm their father.

213
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,200
What they really need is a woman in their life.

214
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,077
A regular family.

215
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,288
Living with my brother and Judy
is in their best interests.

216
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,208
You don't have the right to decide.

217
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,919
What am I supposed to do?

218
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,756
This way you see them exactly
as much as you do now,

219
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,508
on weekends and...

220
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,512
Oh, wait, Don.
When was the last time you saw them?

221
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,687
Betty, I didn't know.

222
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,778
Don, honey, I appreciate your intentions.
I really do.

223
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,201
But I'm not going to waste the rest of my time
arguing about this.

224
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,081
I want to keep things as normal as possible

225
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,042
and you not being here is part of that.

226
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,426
Birdie...

227
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,437
I know.

228
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,574
I have to go.

229
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,788
I'll talk to you soon.

230
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,292
Okay.

231
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,644
Let me get you a glass.

232
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,524
- How was Florida?
- Compelling.

233
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,987
I assume you held on to your Rolodex
when you retired?

234
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,239
Can I taste the wine first?

235
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
You know, you look great.

236
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,415
Thank you.

237
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,626
What do you want?

238
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,088
Every department at Dow department
has to make an industrial film

239
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,424
for the national sales meeting,
and our script just came in.

240
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,427
I fell asleep on page two of thirty.

241
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,804
How long is this film?

242
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,639
See? You know that.

243
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,600
The producer's as drunk as a skunk.
I have to replace him.

244
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,937
Do you remember the name of the guy
who produced Birds Eye?

245
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,688
I'm sure I have his number somewhere.

246
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,942
It's $50,000 for eight minutes.

247
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,069
A good producer could pocket half of it,

248
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,238
but he has to know writers and directors.

249
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,823
And I need it yesterday.

250
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,159
Joan, I can't be eclipsed by plastics
and packaging again.

251
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,744
Relax, Kenny.

252
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,081
For that kind of money,
there'll be ten men for the job.

253
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,416
Great. So, how's the family?

254
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,463
Wonderful. How's Eddie?

255
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,298
He's a little weird, actually.

256
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,425
I think there might be
something wrong with him.

257
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,182
Come in.

258
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,898
We can't ask him for money like this.

259
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,819
Don.

260
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,030
You don't have to come along,
but you promised to stake us.

261
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,617
I'm coming. I'm coming.

262
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,454
Should we pack you?

263
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,336
I'm packed. You can drop me in L.A.

264
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,519
Hello, big shot.

265
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,606
I was hoping we could grab lunch
or a drink and catch up.

266
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,610
It's so good to hear from you.
I thought you forgot about me.

267
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,988
How about the end of next week?

268
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,782
I can't wait. Is your weekend busy?

269
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,286
You really want to catch up?

270
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,538
Well, I ran into Ken, and...

271
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, how is he? Did you tell him I said hi?

272
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,085
Why would you do that?

273
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,173
Dow needs a script yesterday
for an industrial film.

274
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,302
You know the account and, well,
we both thought of you.

275
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,512
I don't have time to moonlight.

276
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,432
It's $1,200 for a ten page script.

277
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,186
Well, anything for a friend.

278
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,232
We can chat when I drop off the research.

279
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,900
Obviously, not there.

280
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,485
Of course.

281
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,418
Dick.

282
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,586
Hello.

283
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,135
What are you doing here?
How'd you find me?

284
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,887
I was in L.A. I called your folks.

285
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,722
They told me you were in town.

286
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,142
And they sent you here for what?

287
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,937
They didn't tell me anything
but your address.

288
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,855
Patty's pretty mad I gave you money.

289
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,732
Well, that's more than she did.

290
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,610
Do you have any liquor?
I've been drinking beer all night.

291
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,655
Sit down. I'll make coffee.

292
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,456
What's going on?

293
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,876
Nothing much. I'm retired.

294
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,462
Been on the road.

295
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,632
Just wanted to see how you were doing.

296
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,217
Meet the little one.

297
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,760
This is bullshit.

298
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,222
Did they fly you in from some drunk tank
to make me feel guilty?

299
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,890
Stephanie, no.

300
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,267
What happened?

301
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,901
He's not here.
He lives with Ronnie's parents. His dad.

302
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,904
I understand.

303
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,617
Listen.

304
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,038
I also thought...

305
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,626
This should be with you.

306
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,380
Megan and I are, well...

307
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,092
I'm sorry about that.

308
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,845
Anna always wanted you to have it.

309
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,931
Come on, Dick.
What am I going to do with that?

310
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,433
Fine. Sell it.

311
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,644
Is that the problem?
You need money?

312
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,856
I appreciate you trying to help me out,

313
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,609
but I'm pretty sure
you're the one who's in trouble.

314
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,785
A lot has happened.

315
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,498
You're welcome to crash here.

316
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,041
I'm going away for a few days.

317
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,503
I don't wanna put you out.
Just need a shower and a shave.

318
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,756
Where you going?

319
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,091
Up the coast.

320
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,094
It's some kind of retreat.

321
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,142
Why don't you close your eyes?
I'll open a can of stew.

322
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,228
Okay.

323
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,989
Are you trying to kill me?

324
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,953
I'm trying to make you happy.

325
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,247
That was our agreement.

326
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,920
Du Maurier. They taste like le shit.

327
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,755
I miss them.

328
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,048
Too bad.

329
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,468
You're done with Canada.

330
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,013
My children live there. You'll learn to love it.

331
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,516
As long as I don't have to see
what's-his-name.

332
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,561
Poor soul. He suddenly
discovered that he wants me.

333
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,398
You saw Emile?

334
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,066
Oh, he was such a tragic figure.

335
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,152
I hope you told him it's too late.

336
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,904
Not everything is your business.

337
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,282
Wait. Did you sleep with him?

338
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,367
Don't raise your voice.
You're not my husband.

339
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,120
You went up there to divorce him.
I forbid you to see him.

340
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,915
You are the one that'll throw me over
and leave me for your secretary.

341
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,334
You know what a low blow is?

342
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,638
All I got was "suitcase."
Yell at me slower or in English.

343
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,683
You live in a hotel.
Go get another room.

344
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,768
- What?
- Out!

345
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,146
Sleep on the sofa.
The television's in there.

346
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,314
That is your friend.

347
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,260
You're coming with me.

348
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,480
Hi, Genie.

349
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,898
Hi, Sally.

350
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,150
I didn't know you were coming home.

351
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,819
I missed you guys. I took the train.

352
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,740
Is it going to happen now?

353
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,617
Is what going to happen?

354
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,750
Gene, go watch TV.

355
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,293
No.

356
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,962
Get out of here.

357
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
Where are they?

358
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,641
Henry's still at work. She's lying down.

359
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,643
That's all she can do.

360
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,397
I don't know what she thinks I think,

361
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,233
but I heard everything
before they stopped fighting.

362
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,237
I don't know how long she has,

363
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,406
but I'm not going to Madrid anymore.

364
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,533
She's not going to like that.

365
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,663
What happened in here?
Smells like a fire.

366
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,958
I was making dinner.

367
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,670
Get the frying pan.
I'll show you how to do it.

368
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,981
- There's someone in here.
- It's more communal this way.

369
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,319
Sun salutation's at dawn,
with yoga and tai chi.

370
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,739
A silent meal at 7:00 a.m.
and the seminars begin at 9:00.

371
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,743
Get some rest. Tomorrow is
going to be beautiful.

372
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,955
You are so generous.

373
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,211
Where are we?

374
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,216
"Psychotechnics?
Anxiety and Tension Control?

375
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,470
"Divorce: A Creative Experience?"

376
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,431
Be open to this. You might feel better.

377
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,392
She took my money. That's a good sign.

378
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,739
Good night, Dick.

379
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,872
Careful. He's a little sticky.

380
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,582
I had pancakes.

381
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,260
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

382
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,566
Look, I've been revising my will,
and with Margaret lost,

383
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,403
I'm dividing most of my estate
between Ellery and...

384
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,240
Roger.

385
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,534
I know you don't want it, but it's for him.

386
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,661
I don't want it to put you
in an awkward position

387
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,454
when some man you used to work with

388
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,707
leaves your son a small fortune.

389
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,625
The good doctor, for example.

390
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,460
Greg had twins with some nurse.

391
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,754
As far as he's concerned,
Kevin never happened.

392
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,880
So, he knows?

393
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,091
No, he's just a terrible person.

394
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,136
What about the guy
you've been hiding from me?

395
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,888
Richard is a man of the world.

396
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,768
Roger, this is an expensive way
to mark your territory.

397
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,270
What? No.

398
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,731
I've just been thinking that

399
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,067
you get to a point in your life
where it's the last chapter...

400
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,194
Are you ill? Is everything okay?

401
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,239
For the time being, but I'm getting married.

402
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,745
Well, those skirts are pretty short at McCann.

403
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,663
Nah, I met her through Megan Draper.

404
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,416
She's old enough to be her mother.

405
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,126
Actually, she is her mother.

406
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,384
That's spectacular. What a mess.

407
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,428
You'd be surprised. Nobody cares.

408
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,099
I guess somebody
finally got their timing right.

409
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,977
So, you'll accept?

410
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,816
If this is what you really want,
I'm not going to say no.

411
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,111
It would be a relief to know that,

412
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,031
no matter what, our beautiful
little boy is secure.

413
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,199
Good.

414
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,951
Get over here.

415
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,372
Little rich bastard.

416
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,417
He really is, I guess.

417
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,339
Thank you.

418
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,814
I didn't want to leave it in the room.

419
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,898
Be open.

420
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,609
Let's go.

421
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,453
That's right. Just walk around the room.

422
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,625
No aiming.

423
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,920
No purpose,

424
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,006
other than to move your legs.

425
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,178
That's it.

426
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,514
Stop.

427
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,769
Look at the person nearest you.

428
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,279
What does that person make you feel?

429
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,784
Now, find a way, without words,

430
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,288
to communicate that feeling
to the other person.

431
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,252
Does hugging feel honest?

432
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,438
So happy to see you.

433
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,981
Me, you, as well.

434
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,068
That's not the only reason I came.

435
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,239
Can we get a couple of Bloody Marys?

436
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,200
Holy shit.

437
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,494
That's the tip of the iceberg, Peggy.

438
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,830
I never know if that's good or bad.

439
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,626
The director, Jeff Dole,
has two more industrials

440
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,502
and he's asked me to produce them.

441
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,087
And they both need scripts.

442
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,089
And when Ken turned your idea in,

443
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,926
they put him in charge
of the corporate presentation.

444
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,636
It's got a $60,000 budget.

445
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,221
I already have a very demanding job.

446
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,723
Do you have a contract?

447
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,393
I really thought you'd be on a beach by now.

448
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,020
I've been to the beach.

449
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,481
But when I talked to Ken,

450
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,566
I realized it would be easy to turn this

451
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,902
into an actual production company.

452
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,698
Eventually, I could hire writers to help you
with the work load.

453
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,951
Slow down.

454
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,702
Harris-Olson.

455
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,122
You need two names to make it sound real.

456
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,376
Are you serious?

457
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,629
Could you give us a minute?

458
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,468
We won't answer to anyone.

459
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,304
It'll be something of ours,
with our name on it.

460
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,891
I'm so flattered.

461
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,560
So?

462
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,398
I don't know.

463
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,567
I can't believe you're hesitating.

464
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,486
How can you work at that place?

465
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,613
It's a huge decision.

466
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,993
Well, you can think about it,

467
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,662
but I need to find someone
by the end of the week.

468
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,746
Find a partner?

469
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,373
Find a writer.

470
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,292
The partnership is just for you.

471
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,941
You don't have to say why you're here.

472
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,111
Why don't you tell me
how you're feeling right now?

473
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,615
I feel like

474
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,909
everyone's judging me.

475
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,956
And how does it feel to tell us that?

476
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,547
Like I'm a little girl
and my parents are looking at me

477
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,593
the way that they look at me now.

478
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,182
Like all I do is screw up.

479
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,811
"You shouldn't have dropped out of school.

480
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,440
"You shouldn't have been with a lowlife.

481
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,734
"Shouldn't have gotten pregnant.

482
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,986
"You should have loved being a mother."

483
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,743
Life is full of "shoulds."

484
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,537
Yeah, but I made a mistake,

485
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,500
and I just want to get it together now.

486
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,252
So you can be with your baby?

487
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,630
What? No.

488
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,009
See? They are judging me.

489
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,307
Why don't you tell Angie how
it feels to hear her say that?

490
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,186
It makes me feel small
and insignificant, Angie.

491
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,527
What I feel when I hear about your baby

492
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,695
is sadness.

493
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,786
My mother left, and I can tell you

494
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,163
that your baby is gonna spend
the rest of his life

495
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,873
staring at the door

496
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,251
waiting for you to walk in.

497
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,095
Stephanie, is it okay if I tell you

498
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,888
how this is making me feel?

499
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,114
Don't listen to them.

500
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,992
You think this is a big laugh, don't you?

501
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,744
You weren't raised with Jesus.

502
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,663
You don't know what happens to people

503
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,331
when they believe in things.

504
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,460
It's true. You think that
I don't want to hear the truth?

505
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,421
I could help you.

506
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,298
I could move to L.A.

507
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,717
I don't know what you're doing.

508
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,595
You show up with some family heirloom.

509
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,724
You're not my family.
What's the matter with you?

510
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,186
I just know how people work.

511
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,354
You can put this behind you.

512
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,274
It'll get easier as you move forward.

513
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:52,572
Dick, I don't think you're right about that.

514
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,703
I have to lie down. I'll see you after dinner.

515
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,465
I'm going to split.

516
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,927
Well, I'm going to sit here
and look at these four walls.

517
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,930
If you're not gonna work,
I can try and catch up.

518
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,098
Get the door.

519
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,606
Do you like it here?

520
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,736
Yeah. It's grown on me.

521
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,990
Joan said she wants to go into business.

522
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,077
She's going to be a producer

523
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,288
and I'd be her partner.

524
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,876
You don't like that?

525
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,089
I can have my name on the door,
be my own boss.

526
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,592
That's not a good reason.

527
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,552
You think it'll fail?

528
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,764
No. You have such a rare talent.

529
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,475
Stop looking over your shoulder
at what other people have.

530
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,018
You don't think I can do it.

531
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,437
I said the opposite.

532
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,732
You're just excited about being in charge.

533
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,194
Working for a producer?
That's not even what you do.

534
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,946
You have no ambition!

535
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,074
I'm just very happy being good at my job.

536
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,867
I've got nothing else to prove.

537
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,078
Spoken like a failure.

538
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,418
I hope you're really drunk,

539
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,213
because you're going to need an excuse.

540
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,923
Stan.

541
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,385
There's more to life than work.

542
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,880
Coffee.

543
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,092
Is the coast clear?

544
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,178
Who'd you think I was talking to?

545
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,596
They're gone.

546
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,556
I could eat a dozen eggs.

547
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,144
I'm sorry, but I just found out

548
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,146
I can't go to Old Lyme this afternoon.

549
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,440
I just wanted you to look at a boat.

550
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,067
Sounds lovely,

551
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,486
but Jeffrey says Nathan's Frankfurters

552
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,029
wants to show me around.

553
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,114
Coney Island. We can make a day of it.

554
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,451
It's a business meeting.

555
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,832
Because you've started a business?

556
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,751
We'll see.

557
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,253
What are you doing?

558
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,131
It's just a couple of little projects.

559
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,092
Don't you want to be with me?

560
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,219
Of course.

561
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,970
But I don't know,

562
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,015
it seems like this might be
a chance to build something.

563
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,645
It's going to take all your time,
all your energy, and all your attention.

564
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,438
That's not true.

565
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,440
It is. I did it.

566
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,651
And you loved it.

567
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,236
I want to be with you

568
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,614
and I don't wanna be rooting for
you to fail so that can happen.

569
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,743
Do you want to get married?
We can get married.

570
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,914
No, I don't want to be back where I was.

571
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,502
This can be different.
We're different people.

572
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,671
I want you in my life.

573
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,302
You really want to answer that, don't you?

574
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,097
No, but I probably should.

575
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,643
You act like this is happening to you

576
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,603
but you're making a choice.

577
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,315
I can't just turn off that part of myself.

578
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,028
I would never dream of making you choose.

579
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,867
When something's wrong, it's always wrong.

580
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,879
Hello. Joan Harris speaking.
Could you please hold for a second?

581
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,382
Richard. Wait. You're being silly.

582
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,470
Good luck, Joan.

583
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,239
Well, hello, Jeff. Sorry about that.

584
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,798
Have you seen Stephanie?

585
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,009
She took off a few hours ago.

586
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,886
Did she say where she was going?

587
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,556
I'm sorry. I would have asked
if I'd known you needed to know, man.

588
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,026
How do I get out of here?
My friend took the car.

589
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,279
We can get you a car and driver
with a couple days' notice.

590
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,740
Or you could hitch,

591
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,909
but you'll be standing there all day.

592
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,119
You can thank Charlie Manson for that.

593
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,749
Damn it.

594
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,586
I'm sure you can get a ride back with
someone by the end of the week.

595
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,171
You're all paid up.

596
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,384
People just come and go
and no one says goodbye?

597
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,764
I'm sorry, but people are free
to come and go as they please.

598
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,397
I have a person-to-person call
for Peggy Olson

599
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,481
from Donald Draper.

600
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,441
This is Peggy Olson. I accept.

601
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,986
Where the hell are you?

602
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,447
Somewhere in California.

603
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,743
Do you know how angry everyone is?

604
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,497
Did everything fall apart without me?

605
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,041
It's not about that. You just took off.

606
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,501
People were worried.

607
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,045
What have you been doing?

608
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,096
I don't know.

609
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,016
I have no idea.

610
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,268
Look,

611
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,105
I know you get sick
of things and you run,

612
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,608
but you can come home.

613
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,903
Where?

614
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,239
McCann will take you back in a second.

615
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,074
Apparently, it's happened before.

616
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,160
Don't you want to work on Coke?

617
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,831
I can't.

618
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,834
I can't get out of here.

619
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,591
Don, come home.

620
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,638
I messed everything up.

621
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,063
I'm not the man you think I am.

622
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,530
Don, listen to me.

623
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,035
What did you ever do that was so bad?

624
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,747
I broke all my vows.

625
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,127
I scandalized my child.

626
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,674
I took another man's name

627
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,717
and made,

628
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,806
nothing of it.

629
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,893
That's not true.

630
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,947
I only called because I,

631
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,744
realized I never said goodbye to you.

632
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,964
I don't think you should be alone right now.

633
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,050
I'm in a crowd.

634
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,719
I just wanted to hear your voice.

635
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,803
I'll see you soon.

636
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,304
Wait.

637
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,416
Rizzo.

638
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,834
It's me.

639
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,711
What do you want?

640
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,338
I just got off the phone with Don.

641
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,508
Are you kidding me? Where the hell is he?

642
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,010
California.

643
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,555
But he didn't say where.
I'm really worried about him.

644
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,067
He always does this
and he always comes back.

645
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,528
He's a survivor. He's going to be okay.

646
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,782
You didn't hear him.
He wasn't making any sense.

647
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,202
You've got to let him go.

648
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,579
It doesn't mean you stop caring about him.

649
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,130
I'm sorry I said those shitty things to you.

650
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,758
I don't believe them.

651
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,137
Look, you're going to do great
no matter what you do.

652
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,890
I think you were right.

653
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,059
I mean, I'm going to stay.

654
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,229
Good, because I didn't want you to leave.

655
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,439
Then why didn't you just say that?

656
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,900
Because every time I'm face to face with you,

657
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,527
I want to strangle you.

658
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,739
And then I miss you when I go away.

659
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,741
And I miss you, I call you on the phone,

660
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,952
and I get the person I want to talk to.

661
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,745
That's not true.

662
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,413
Yeah, well, I don't know what it is,

663
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,249
but when I'm standing in front of you,

664
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,125
I bring out something terrible.

665
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,714
I think about how you came into my life

666
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:39,510
and how you drove me crazy, and now

667
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,138
I don't even know what to do with myself

668
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,766
because all I want to do is be with you.

669
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,769
What?

670
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,271
What did you just say?

671
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,234
I want to be with you.

672
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,280
I'm in love with you.

673
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,617
What?

674
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,954
I love you, Peggy.

675
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,916
Oh, my God!

676
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,921
That's what I thought you said.

677
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,302
I don't know what to say.

678
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,597
I feel like I can't breathe almost.

679
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,474
I mean, I don't even think about you.

680
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,855
Uh, I mean, I do all the time,

681
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,399
because you're there.

682
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,069
And you're here.

683
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,157
And you make everything okay.

684
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,492
You always do.

685
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,455
No matter what.

686
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,088
I mean, I must be.

687
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,967
Because you're always right.

688
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,973
I can't believe this.

689
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,436
I think I'm in love with you, too.

690
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,233
I really do.

691
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,659
Stan?

692
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,746
Are you there?

693
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,337
Stan?

694
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,593
What were you saying?

695
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,806
I love you.

696
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,716
Are you waiting for a phone call?

697
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,593
What?

698
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,097
Have you taken something?

699
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,316
You know what? Why don't you
come with me to my seminar?

700
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,278
I can't move.

701
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,948
Sure you can. I'm late.

702
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,785
I don't want to walk in by myself.

703
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,963
I guess what I feel is I had my hang-ups.

704
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,092
She had her hang-ups,

705
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:12,222
but one of us was willing
to reduce the conflict.

706
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,189
How would you feel about
starting with that next time?

707
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,524
My name's Leonard

708
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,777
and I don't know if there's anything

709
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,529
that complicated about me.

710
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,199
Which is why I should be happier, I guess.

711
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,411
Do you remember what I said
to Daniel about "should?"

712
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,875
Well, it's good for him. He's interesting.

713
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,213
But I've never been interesting to anybody.

714
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,926
I work in an office.

715
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,223
People walk right by me.
I know they don't see me.

716
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,270
And I go home
and I watch my wife and my kids.

717
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,483
They don't look up when I sit down.

718
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,324
How does it feel to say that?

719
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,619
I don't know.

720
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,041
It's like no one cares that I'm gone.

721
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,300
They should love me.

722
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,302
I mean, maybe they do,

723
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,681
but I don't even know what it is.

724
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,518
You spend your whole life

725
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,272
thinking you're not getting it,
people aren't giving it to you.

726
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,068
Then you realize they're trying,

727
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,532
and you don't even know what it is.

728
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,291
I had a dream I was on a shelf
in the refrigerator.

729
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,796
Someone closes the door
and the light goes off,

730
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,134
and I know everybody's out there eating.

731
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,973
And then they open the door
and you see them smiling.

732
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,268
And they're happy to see you,

733
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,940
but maybe they don't look right at you

734
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,610
and maybe they don't pick you.

735
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,913
And then the door closes again.

736
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,750
The light goes off.

737
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,745
Welcome aboard!

738
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,053
Holloway-Harris. How may I help you?

739
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,929
Of course. Please hold for Joan.

740
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,350
This is Joan.

741
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,399
Look at them. One day that will be us.

742
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,526
Yeah, tomorrow.

743
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,215
Mother Sun, we greet you

744
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,386
and are thankful
for the sweetness of the Earth.

745
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,889
The new day brings new hope.

746
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,684
The lives we've led,

747
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,353
the lives we get to lead.

748
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,730
A new day,

749
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,525
new ideas,

750
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,361
a new you.

751
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,829
Om.

752
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:56,877
Om.

753
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:04,593
Om.

754
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,394
I'd like to buy the world a home

755
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,606
And furnish it with love

756
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:21,443
Grow apple trees and honey bees

757
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,946
And snow white turtle doves

758
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,492
I'd like to teach the world
to sing

759
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,827
- Sing with me
- In perfect harmony

760
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,662
Perfect harmony

761
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,874
I'd like to buy the world a Coke

762
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,335
And keep it company

763
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,628
That's the real thing

764
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,048
I'd like to teach the world
to sing

765
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,925
In perfect harmony

766
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,676
Perfect harmony

767
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,846
I'd like to buy the world a Coke

768
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,641
And keep it company

769
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,893
And it's the real thing

770
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,269
Coke is

771
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,563
What the world wants today

772
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,898
Coca-Cola

773
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,150
Is the real thing

774
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:02,817
Coke is

775
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:03,485
Coke is

776
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,904
What the world wants today

777
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,113
Coca-Cola

778
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,533
Is the real thing
