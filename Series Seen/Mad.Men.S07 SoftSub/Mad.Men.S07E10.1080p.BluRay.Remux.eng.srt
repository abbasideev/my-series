1
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,347
Hello?

2
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,690
Don.

3
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,151
Don.

4
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,487
Draper!

5
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,161
Melanie. I'm sorry.
I must have overslept.

6
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,871
They're coming before work.

7
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,832
I told your service,
but you never called me back.

8
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,460
There's no time for a shower.

9
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,049
I'll make the bed.

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,104
I thought you were having
the carpets cleaned?

11
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,731
I did.

12
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,819
I find it hard to believe I have to
replace it to sell this place.

13
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,321
Couldn't you rent a couple of pieces?

14
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,948
It's so lonely.

15
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,616
It's better.

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,494
They can imagine their own things in it.

17
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,746
Have you ever sold an apartment?

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,457
I've sold a lot uglier things than this.

19
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,209
Can you go?

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,920
Don't want you crossing paths.

21
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,509
Good luck.

22
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,443
Hello?

23
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,405
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

24
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,744
Hello?

25
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,415
Yes, Mom, you woke me.

26
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,835
I don't know. I'm not due at the office yet.

27
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,299
Los Angeles is three hours earlier.
It's simple subtraction.

28
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,801
I want to talk to him, too.

29
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,139
Well, hello, sweetie.

30
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,641
Do you know how much I miss you?

31
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,436
What did you and Grandma Gail
do this morning?

32
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,480
Hello?

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,482
Hello?

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,034
Room service, please.

35
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,329
I'd like a glass of skim milk,

36
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,623
a grapefruit, and a pot of coffee.

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,459
And some French toast.

38
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,218
You wanted to see me?

39
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,469
Come in. Have a seat.

40
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,140
Can I offer you something?
A pad and pen perhaps?

41
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,435
You know, I could have you killed

42
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,938
for drinking anything but a Coke around here.

43
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,189
To whom it may concern?

44
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,401
Our benevolent overlords
at McCann have invited

45
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,736
select presidents of select subsidiaries

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,363
to a godless retreat in the Bahamas.

47
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,740
So, you have to make a speech.

48
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,992
That's what I thought,
I figured it'll be like a toast, you know?

49
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,411
I'm good at that.

50
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,870
Apparently, Caroline looked at the fine print

51
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,539
and they're expecting
some sort of written statement

52
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,915
on the future of this company.

53
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,250
Twenty-five hundred words.

54
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,334
When?

55
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,336
By Monday. Plenty of time.

56
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,963
Harry's writing a manifesto on the computer.

57
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,881
Chaough's doing performance reviews.

58
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,634
And they need to finish with a nice
Gettysburg Address-type speech

59
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,803
that tells them where we'll be next year.

60
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,722
Mr. Sterling, there's a call
for you on line three.

61
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,016
Gettysburg Address. Got it.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,269
I'd do it myself, but one of us is very busy.

63
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,979
You're going to the Bahamas.

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm sorry. How are you doing?

65
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,568
Never been better.

66
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,070
Well, you've looked better.
You want me to get my barber in here?

67
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,531
Anything else?

68
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,950
Here are the specs.

69
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,743
Just reasonable hopes and dreams.

70
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,370
Doesn't have to be science fiction.

71
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707
Roger?

72
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,466
You must be Dee.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,636
What a pleasure to meet you
in the flesh.

74
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,185
Top of the morning. How was your trip?

75
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,769
So far so good.

76
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,896
How about that sun?

77
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,022
Yes.

78
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,857
Have you been to California before?

79
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,984
Listen, I've got to run an errand. I'll be back.

80
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,736
First appointment is at noon.

81
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,863
Did we have a cancellation?

82
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,823
You're interviewing people
who already have jobs.

83
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,451
They have to sneak out.
It's lunch or breakfast.

84
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,579
Well, I thought we could rank
the candidates in advance.

85
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,789
Come on, I did it, you did it.

86
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,458
No need to do it together.

87
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,584
Santa Monica or Sunset?

88
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,503
Sunset to Highland to Cahuenga.

89
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,052
Why don't you show me around?

90
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,263
How is the Beverly Wilshire?
Have you seen Warren Beatty?

91
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,098
Not yet.

92
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,437
More money, bigger accounts, more awards,

93
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,439
international business...

94
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,316
and a space station?

95
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,401
Gas station.

96
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,112
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

97
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,364
Do you have my thesaurus?

98
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,698
Probably.

99
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,284
Listen, you need to sign off
on the Peter Pan cookie.

100
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
- He's very busy.
- Stay out of this.

101
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,164
We can't take it out without
you signing off on it and you know it.

102
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:19,963
Let's go.

103
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,631
You need me to set it up?

104
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,383
No, just broad strokes.

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,221
Peter Pan's best friend is Tinker Bell.

106
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,974
That's why his delicious cookie
is named after her.

107
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,018
We have "Dear John" letters
in children's handwriting

108
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,188
with kid voice-over explaining
why they've left the competitors

109
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,357
for the unique taste of Tinker Bell Cookies,

110
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,401
made with real Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

111
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,404
Each letter has a little joke
about the competition.

112
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,408
"Dear Nilla Wafers,
it's so plain it's over. Susie."

113
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,078
"Dear Oreos, don't split apart, I love another."

114
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,830
"Dear Chips Ahoy, I hope..."

115
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,081
Okay, I get it.

116
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,459
And then a cartoon touch of the wand
on the cookie. A sparkle.

117
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,503
"Peter Pan Peanut Butter lovers

118
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,673
"love Tinker Bell Cookies
more than all others."

119
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,302
Jesus, love again?

120
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,095
We use it all the time.

121
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,265
Kids won't get it
and adults won't hear it.

122
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,183
It's not up for debate.
Do you have another line?

123
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,185
"One Tink and you're hooked."

124
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,104
What's wrong with that?

125
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,314
I was worried.

126
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,482
How will they know "Tink" is Tinker Bell?

127
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,527
Because you're going to tell them
five times in 60 seconds.

128
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,239
Are we still going to be ready?

129
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,199
Yeah. That's why we had this meeting.

130
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,665
Jim McCloud is gonna be here any minute.
Where's Lou?

131
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,250
He called. He's running late.

132
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,044
He called? From where?

133
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,879
Don't be mad at him.

134
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,756
He's working on something very big.

135
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,299
What?

136
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,718
Between us...

137
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,345
Hanna-Barbera.

138
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,138
The cartoon studio?

139
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,725
Yes. They're very interested
in this comic he created.

140
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,352
It's like Gomer Pyle,

141
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,728
but he's a monkey.

142
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,105
How long has this been going on?

143
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,359
Since he was in the army. I think he misses it.

144
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,028
That's not what I meant.

145
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,908
Hello. How are you?
You must be Mr. McCloud.

146
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,619
Yes. Yes, I am.

147
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,745
And you are?

148
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm Joan Harris.

149
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,457
I'm an account executive and a partner.

150
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,794
Mr. Avery is stuck in traffic,
but I suppose we can begin.

151
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,506
Dee, would you offer
Mr. McCloud some coffee?

153
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,882
Please.

154
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,509
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

155
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,177
I was catching up with Jim here.

156
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,221
Jim McCloud, Joan Harris.

157
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
It's a pleasure to meet you.

158
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,517
Pleasure's mine.

159
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,061
Jim, come on in. Take a load off.

160
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,729
Dee, can you get me a Sanka?

161
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,943
Who are you?

162
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,237
Richard Burghoff.

163
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,239
I'm looking for my optometrist.

164
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,282
Why didn't you say so?

165
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,576
A woman like you wants to talk to me,

166
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,453
I'm a little nearsighted, I'm not blind.

167
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,873
Have dinner with me.

168
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,041
I don't know.

169
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,629
I want to see if I can get the job.

170
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,466
Joan, are you coming or not?

171
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,718
I have to go.

172
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,344
French?

173
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,356
Why am I signing these now?

174
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,901
Because you sign it again when they cash it.

175
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,695
That's how they know it's you.

176
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,073
But anyone who steals this
could copy my signature too.

177
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,409
They have it worked out, Sally.

178
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,829
Why are you snapping at me?
This trip was your idea.

179
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,415
I'm going to miss you.

180
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,711
You should really talk to them
about Colonial Williamsburg.

181
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,129
You're driving right by it.

182
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,632
It's 12 states in 12 days.
They can't stop everywhere.

183
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,761
Well, when I did the trip, it was six states.

184
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,220
Weren't they still colonies?

185
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,309
We got into a little bit of trouble

186
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,853
and I want you to know that's to be expected.

187
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,063
Trouble? Really?

188
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,775
You know, staying up all night.

189
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,738
We would try and break all the light bulbs

190
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,698
in the hallway at every hotel.

191
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,202
We're not going to do that.

192
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,162
Well...

193
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,332
There are going to be boys everywhere

194
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,626
and you're going to be away from home.

195
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,169
So

196
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,962
I hope you have the good sense

197
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,965
to not act like you've been let out of a cage.

198
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,926
I'm sorry, Mother,

199
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,386
but this conversation is a little late.

200
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,224
And so am I.

201
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,227
Everything is a joke to you.

202
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,824
- How'd it go?
- About how I expected.

203
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,577
They loved the lobby,
but the emptiness is a problem.

204
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,454
There's other ways to sell things.

205
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,832
I'm using everything I have,

206
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,000
but this requires too much imagination.

207
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,586
That's the best opportunity in the world.

208
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,589
Who's your best prospect?

209
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,341
It was a young stockbroker from New Jersey

210
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,260
with a 4-year-old and one on the way.

211
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,720
Why don't you tell them somebody lived here

212
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,932
who made a million dollars
inventing the Frisbee.

213
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,270
And they had to move in a hurry
to a castle in France. Taxes.

214
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,232
A little glamour, a little hope.

215
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,192
I'm not a magician.

216
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,736
I have to show it to people
with their eyes open.

217
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,363
And you know what it looks like?

218
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,490
It looks like a sad person lives here.

219
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,868
And what happened to him?

220
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,370
He got divorced,
spilled wine on the carpeting,

221
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,373
and didn't care enough to
replace it, even for himself.

222
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't blame your failure on me.

223
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,043
This place reeks of failure.

224
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,296
It is an $85,000 fixer-upper.

225
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,048
A lot of wonderful things happened here.

226
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,885
Well, you wouldn't know it.

227
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,308
I have a good feeling about things.

228
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,393
See you tomorrow.

229
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,534
You know I have a very early flight.

230
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,913
You are not going anywhere.

231
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,289
I'm serious.

232
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,125
Joan, I've been in prison for five years.

233
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,668
You're acting like it.

234
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,006
Here's the plan.

235
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,425
First, I'm gonna kiss you.

236
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,760
I know the rest of this...

237
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,054
Then you're gonna cancel your flight.

238
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,973
Then I'm gonna drive you
up to Malibu for lobster

239
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,017
in one of those tourist traps

240
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,269
where everyone's getting engaged.

241
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,563
Then on up to the Biltmore in Santa Barbara

242
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,232
where I'll sit on a lounge chair,

243
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,693
and watch you get in and out of the pool.

244
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,114
Richard, that sounds wonderful.

245
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,991
But I have someplace to be.

246
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,202
And I'm sure you do as well.

247
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,914
- I told you, I'm retired.
- Yes.

248
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,751
And you were a millionaire developer.

249
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,378
You must think I just fell off a truck.

250
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,381
Are you a movie producer as well?

251
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,049
No.

252
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,678
But the rest of it is the truth, honey.

253
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,849
What is the rest of it?

254
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,228
I guess we've been
dancing around this all night.

255
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,064
I'm divorced.

256
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,565
You?

257
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,152
You think I would be doing this
if I was married?

258
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,571
Have you ever been married?

259
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,907
Yes.

260
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,951
Boy, did he blow it.

261
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,452
He did.

262
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,627
Twenty-two years.

263
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,505
I stayed in it for the kids.

264
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,426
And when my youngest graduated,

265
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,804
I saw her heading off to Europe and I thought,

266
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,014
"Jeez,

267
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,224
"that looks good."

268
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,603
I mean, hell, I built something.
I built a lot of things.

269
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,733
But I also put off a lot of things.

270
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,111
And now I'm free. As a bird.

271
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,073
I need to work.

272
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,827
So you have mouths to feed?

273
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,830
No.

274
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,086
I just finally got the job I've always wanted.

275
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,507
So you're just an executive
on a trip out of town.

276
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,843
I'll send you flowers.

277
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,029
Good morning, Meredith.

278
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,782
Mr. Sterling came by
for your prognostication.

279
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,575
I told him you were at the library.

280
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,993
Not a bad idea.

281
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,746
And can you dig up the press release
from when we started SCDP?

282
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,247
That would be December '63.

283
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,373
Coffee?

284
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,458
Good morning, Don.

285
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,879
No. I'll get it.

286
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,639
Meredith got me two of these.
I only need one.

287
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,932
Sure.

288
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,477
When are you casting St. Joseph's?

289
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,522
Two weeks. Did you meet someone
we should see?

290
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,608
No, just organizing my schedule.

291
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,363
You ever feel like there's less to
actually do, but more to think about?

292
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,074
Not really.

293
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,450
Maybe I'm a bad manager.

294
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,077
Maybe I'm too...

295
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,745
What do they call it? Hands-on.

296
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,083
So, going to this casting
session. What's next?

297
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,335
Shoot the ad?

298
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,087
No.

299
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,756
What's the future going to bring?

300
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,761
I mean, it's good as it is, but is there
a scenario in which it's better?

301
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,097
You're incredible.

302
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,266
You know, Roger asked me to do that first.

303
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,061
How'd you get out of it?

304
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,648
I thought about it a little and then I realized

305
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,484
you're so much better at painting a picture.

306
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,403
So, you did have thoughts.

307
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,155
Sure.

308
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,075
We'll have an oil company.
You know, maybe Goodyear Tires.

309
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,702
We know so much about cars.

310
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,495
That's your dream?

311
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,997
No, I mean,

312
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,749
obviously I'd like to one day...

313
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,043
I don't know.

314
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,546
What?

315
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,050
I'd really love to

316
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,012
land a pharmaceutical.

317
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,307
Bigger accounts?

318
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,767
That's your greatest desire?

319
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,728
That's why I'm doing
the performance reviews.

320
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,357
You know, before McCann,
all I ever thought of

321
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,318
was will we be in business next year?

322
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,195
Or will I be here at all?

323
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,405
Now, it could be anything.

324
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,623
I have a Richard Burghoff
on the line.

325
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,792
I'll take it.

326
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,382
Hello.

327
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,719
Well, your story checks out.

328
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,265
It's nice to hear from you.

329
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,850
How are things in paradise?

330
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,061
I don't know. I'm in town.

331
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,146
What? You're in New York?

332
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,357
Tell me where we're eating.

333
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,110
The Oak Room, 7:30.

334
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,321
Should I pick you up at work or at home?

335
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,948
I'll see you there.

336
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,660
Well, good. You can make an entrance.

337
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,510
- There you are.
- There you are.

338
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,512
We have a peanut butter cookie problem.

339
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,097
Don, don't listen to him.

340
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,390
Pete, what are you doing?

341
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,933
The client hated the layout.

342
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,685
Exactly, that's the problem.

343
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,729
And then Mathis and Ed turned on each other.

344
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,315
There was some kind of
"I told you so" exchange,

345
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,609
which was already unbearably inappropriate.

346
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,862
And then Mathis said...

347
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,365
A four-letter word that starts with "F."

348
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,950
Have you ever heard such a thing?

349
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,327
He was frustrated. He can't fire my men.

350
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,495
I can fire you!

351
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,621
Hold on.

352
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,374
Nobody's getting fired.
You have to send those idiots back in.

353
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,625
Absolutely not!

354
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,295
If you send someone new, it looks
like we're starting over.

355
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,131
It was a crime of passion.
They've heard the word before.

356
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,215
Fine.

357
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,552
I want new work fast.

358
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,095
Problem solved.

359
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,190
May I help you?

360
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,860
Is Sally home? I'm a friend of hers.

361
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,778
Sally.

362
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,239
There's a young man here to see you.

363
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,450
What's your name, ma'am?

364
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,243
It's Loretta.

365
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,287
Is Mrs. Draper home?

366
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,080
You mean Mrs. Francis.

367
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,665
What are you doing here?

368
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,085
I was in the neighborhood.

369
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,048
You know, Betty's home.

370
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,258
I don't care. I just wanted to see you.

371
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,302
See? You survived finals.

372
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,180
How's your summer?

373
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,848
I'm going on a teen tour.

374
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,767
Then, maybe be a lifeguard again.

375
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,061
Do you have something to do right now?

376
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,564
- I got it.
- I got it.

377
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,233
Hey, I'll be out in a second.

378
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,444
I have to use the restroom.

379
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,905
This is Paula. This is Sally.

380
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,991
Hey there. Could you get me
a map to the powder room?

381
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,868
First door on the left.

382
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,080
Hello.

383
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,207
You have a lovely home.

384
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,794
Sally, I didn't know you had guests.

385
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,881
We just dropped by.

386
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,466
We were on our way to Playland

387
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,718
and thought maybe you'd want to come.

388
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,596
Aren't you going to introduce me?

389
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,102
I'm Glen Bishop. We lived
up the street in Ossining.

390
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,979
Glen?

391
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,275
My goodness. How old are you?

392
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,819
Eighteen.

393
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,531
So, you two have stayed in touch?

394
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,117
- Yeah.
- We've been pen pals.

395
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,618
What have you been doing with yourself?

396
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,662
You look so different.

397
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,456
You look exactly the same.

398
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,210
Good, you found my backpack.

399
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,212
Yes, it was in the storage room.

400
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,172
You must be in school.

401
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,133
Yeah, just finished my freshman
year up at Purchase.

402
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,176
That's supposed to be very good.

403
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,387
I'm actually going back to school myself
this fall.

404
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,722
Very cool.

405
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,688
Can I have some actual money
to take to Playland?

406
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,941
What? Of course. Go get my pocketbook.

407
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,276
Can't you?

408
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,448
Hey. Sorry for running past you.

409
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,825
My mother hates that. Just really had to go.

410
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,702
That's quite all right.

411
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,454
Can I offer you all something to drink?

412
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,080
- Iced tea?
- No.

413
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,249
- I'd take a beer if you got one.
- Of course.

414
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,919
Hold on. I thought we were going
to Playland. Are you coming?

415
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,797
I'd love to go with you,
but I don't have any money.

416
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,758
You talk to your parents this way?

417
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,722
Do you have any grass?

418
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,433
We can get it there.

419
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,563
Don't stay too late. You have to pack.

420
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,899
Nice meeting you.

421
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

422
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,736
Betty.

423
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,488
Yes?

424
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,241
I feel like I should say a more formal goodbye.

425
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,204
Nonsense. You're welcome here anytime.

426
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,165
No. It's just that

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,418
I'm shipping out next week.

428
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,796
What do you mean?

429
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,049
I'm reporting.

430
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,009
He joined the army.

431
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,512
Are you kidding?

432
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,679
No.

433
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,599
- Are you fucking stupid?
- Sally!

434
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,267
I don't expect you to understand.

435
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,811
- You hate the war.
- Not anymore.

436
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,148
What about Kent State? You were crying.

437
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,983
You were gonna join the movement.

438
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,610
What about a bunch of Negro kids dying

439
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,278
while we just sit at home getting stoned?

440
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,280
- It's immoral.
- Was this your idea?

441
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,282
We just met.

442
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,494
You're gonna die. For what?

443
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,664
Don't listen to Jane Fonda here.

444
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,499
It's a very brave thing to do.

445
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,377
You know what?

446
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,212
Have fun at Playland.

447
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,381
Just remember those kids are the same age

448
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,217
as the ones you're going to be
murdering in Vietnam.

449
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,469
Sally, come on.

450
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,724
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,602
No.

452
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,104
I expected it.

453
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,650
Well, you've obviously grown
into a fine young man.

454
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,444
Thank you, ma'am.

455
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,575
Please don't let this mar your afternoon.

456
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,285
We'll see you when you get back.

457
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,495
Sally, too.

458
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,219
Fourscore and seven years ago.

459
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,975
We know where we've been,
we know where we are.

460
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,061
Let's assume that it's good.

461
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,026
But it's got to get better.

462
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,530
It's supposed to get better.

463
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,244
Mr. Mathis needs to see you.
I told him you were busy.

464
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,123
Send him in.

465
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,293
Hello, Don.

466
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,047
Just wanted to thank you for fighting for me.

467
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,423
Who told you that?

468
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,884
Should we open it?

469
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,428
I'm set.

470
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,598
I appreciate your confidence in me.

471
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,891
What do you want?

472
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,518
I want you to come to the meeting.

473
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,978
No.

474
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,565
You have to make this right yourself.

475
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,611
How? I mean, do I apologize to them?

476
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,029
Do I apologize to Ed?

477
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,448
Do I slam my hand in the door over and over?

478
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,825
I once interrupted the client

479
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,787
during a presentation for
Lucky Strike, our biggest account.

480
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,872
- What did you say?
- I wasn't supposed to talk at all.

481
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,834
I knew if I apologized, they'd never
wanna work with me again.

482
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,252
Why?

483
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,380
Do I really have to explain that?

484
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,174
Not if you don't want to.

485
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,387
So the next meeting, I walked in,
shook Lee Garner's hand and said,

486
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,888
"I can't believe you have the balls

487
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,391
"to come back after you
embarrassed yourself like that."

488
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,936
Okay. I think I understand.

489
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,271
I don't know.

490
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,523
Bring in a bar of soap.

491
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,401
Tell them it's there in case
you need to wash your mouth.

492
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,610
Something like that.

493
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,154
Thank you, Don.

494
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,793
This was a big deal. Four golf courses.

495
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,337
Some with estates planned on the perimeter.

496
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,923
- Palos Verdes.
- Is that nice?

497
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,675
Yes, dear.

498
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,051
And all of a sudden,

499
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,804
some hippies come out of the wall yelling

500
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,265
about low-income housing, killing birds.

501
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,891
Must be real radicals

502
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,811
to prefer low-income housing
to a golf course.

503
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,771
Come on, whose side are you on?

504
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,940
I just root for the underdog.

505
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,444
Well, let's see how softhearted you are.

506
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,653
How about a nightcap?

507
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,780
That sounds nice.

508
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,665
Where did you tell him you were?

509
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,709
Who?

510
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,170
Tell me the truth. Are you married?

511
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,256
No.

512
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,342
Please don't lie to me.

513
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,097
I have a little boy.

514
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,353
His name is Kevin and he's four.

515
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,064
Four? That's a very little boy.

516
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,318
Does that make a difference?

517
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,570
No.

518
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,866
Can I get the check?

519
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,750
Yes, I'm fine.

520
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,544
When do you expect him back?

521
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,591
But I'm going out of town tomorrow

522
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,593
and I want to say goodbye.

523
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,933
Yes.

524
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,898
Just tell him I'm sorry

525
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,026
and I want to say goodbye.

526
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,403
He has to call me.

527
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,452
I'm sorry. I didn't want to make you cry.

528
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,917
Okay.

529
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,387
What are you doing?

530
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,931
I want your hands free.

531
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,275
Do you mind if I make a phone call?

532
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,778
I should tell somebody I'm going to be late.

533
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:23,326
- Can I offer you a brandy?
- Gin and tonic.

534
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,883
May I have an outside line, please?

535
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,551
Look at this. Ice.

536
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,387
That's a good hotel.

537
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,097
Well, I'm not gonna ask now,
as a matter of fact...

538
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,481
Harris residence.

539
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,983
Hello, Maureen. It's Joan.

540
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,903
I wanted to see if you could
stay a few hours longer.

541
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,738
I don't know.

542
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,240
It's already a quarter to 10:00.

543
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,619
Well, what did we say, 11:00?
How about 1:00?

544
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,205
I don't know. I kind of have someplace to be.

545
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,959
Any chance in persuading you
to stay until midnight?

546
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,339
Okay. You know,
he had trouble going to sleep.

547
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,215
He said he was afraid of a cow or something.

548
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,927
It's a horse. Is everything okay now?

549
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,012
I don't know. I haven't heard anything.

550
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,555
I'll check on him.

551
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,557
Wonderful. Thanks so much.

552
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,938
You need to go?

553
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,523
No. We have all the time we need.

554
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,359
Or until midnight.

555
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,070
I wasn't going to spend the night

556
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,030
under any circumstances.

557
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,074
It's the kind of woman I am.

558
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,368
A woman with a little kid.

559
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,873
Would you rather I was married?

560
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,210
Honey, give me a little bit of credit
for the fact that, well,

561
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,545
I could have been a cad

562
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,839
and waited until after to tell you...

563
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,926
I don't like this.

564
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,303
You don't like what?

565
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,680
I love kids.

566
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,683
But I raised mine already and I'm...

567
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,687
I know it sounds selfish.

568
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,189
I mean, I'm done with that part of my life.

569
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,942
You're being presumptuous.

570
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,778
I know what this is and so do you.

571
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,405
Or you wouldn't have lied.

572
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,408
I can't believe this.

573
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,868
You're such a disappointment.

574
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,204
This is not how I saw things.

575
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,581
I have a plan, which is no plans.

576
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,627
You can't go to the pyramids.
You can't go anywhere.

577
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,255
You're right.

578
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,260
Nice meeting you.

579
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,744
Miss Olson would like to see you
when you have a moment.

580
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,287
Send her in.

581
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,130
Ted told me I have to fill out
my own performance review.

582
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,340
I guess he respects your opinion.

583
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,925
I'm tired of this.

584
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,218
I'd start with that.

585
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,636
I'm serious.

586
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,806
I want to have my performance reviewed.

587
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,475
I've had quite a year.

588
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,822
What do you see for the future?

589
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,660
Well, is that on there?

590
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,454
No, I'm just curious.

591
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,376
I'd like to be the first
woman creative director at this agency.

592
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,338
That's funny to you?

593
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,965
No, I'm impressed that you know exactly.

594
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,259
What else is there?

595
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,970
That's what I'm asking.

596
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,640
Let's say you get that.

597
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,850
What's next?

598
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,605
Land something huge.

599
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,566
And then?

600
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,402
Have a big idea.

601
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,739
Create a catchphrase.

602
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,158
So you want fame?

603
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,702
Yes.

604
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,413
What else?

605
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,792
I don't know.

606
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,837
Yes, you do.

607
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,342
Create something

608
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,511
of lasting value.

609
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,057
In advertising?

610
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,435
This is supposed to be about my job,
not the meaning of life.

611
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,813
So you think those things are unrelated?

612
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,314
I didn't know you'd be in a mood.

613
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,941
Do you want me to do this or not?

614
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,235
Why don't you just write down
all of your dreams

615
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,945
so I can shit on them?

616
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,624
Where the hell were you?

617
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,378
Good morning to you, too. I was at class.

618
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,297
Why didn't mention that last night?

619
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,007
Didn't Gail give you my schedule?

620
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,051
You and Gail are quite a team.

621
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,512
She really needed a vacation.

622
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,514
I think you need a vacation.

623
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,765
You know what?

624
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,559
You're ruining my life.

625
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,854
Bye-bye.

626
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,526
Bye-bye, sweetie.

627
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,991
Anyway, I think you'll be impressed.

628
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,578
If nothing else, by the speed with which
they turned this around.

629
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,205
Well, nice to see you again.

630
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,167
I can't believe you two
have the balls to walk back into this place

631
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,794
after the way you embarrassed yourselves.

632
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,268
Did you go to the World's Fair?

633
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,520
That's what I think it's going to look like.

634
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,819
What was your favorite part?

635
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,322
Good. You're here.

636
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,032
- Can I help you?
- Get out.

637
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,450
What's going on?

638
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,953
I tried your little saying
and I'm off the business.

639
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,537
What are you talking about?

640
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,874
I made your joke and it failed miserably.

641
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,751
- The soap thing?
- No!

642
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,212
The one where I told them they were assholes.

643
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,051
You could've thought of
something yourself, you know.

644
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,761
I did. It was apologize,

645
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,304
but you don't understand that

646
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,806
because guys like you don't have to do it.

647
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,474
Guys like me know how to do it.

648
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,601
Roger tells that Lucky Strike story, too.

649
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,479
But he says that Lee Garner Jr.
was in love with you.

650
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,731
That you always had to be at the meetings

651
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,400
so he could think about jacking you off.

652
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,193
You have a foul mouth.

653
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,029
Take responsibility for your failure.

654
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,073
That account was handed to you
and you made nothing of it

655
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,408
because you have no character.

656
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,784
You don't have any character.

657
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,869
You're just handsome. Stop kidding yourself.

658
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,293
Everybody has problems.

659
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,170
Some people can deal with them
and some people can't.

660
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,380
Look at yourself.

661
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,174
Because the next thing you're going to have
to move past is losing this job.

662
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,426
You're fired.

663
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,721
I guess I kind of assumed that
when I walked in here.

664
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,848
I just knew I shouldn't apologize.

665
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,234
- Is everything all right?
- Can you shut the door for me?

666
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,619
There's a Jim McCloud
here to see you.

667
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,788
He's waiting in the lounge.

668
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,592
What are you doing here?

669
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,766
Well, thank you so much.

670
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,393
I'm a heel, okay?

671
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,689
No, it's my fault.

672
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,525
I thought about it
and I'm sending my son away.

673
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,651
What?

674
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,072
No, I thought about what
you said. And I like you too.

675
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:43,785
And if I have to choose between
you and my son, I choose you.

676
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,578
That's not what I said.

677
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,288
That's exactly what you said.

678
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,834
Well, I've thought about it and I want
to be a part of your life.

679
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,129
And your little boy, too.

680
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,675
I live with my mother.

681
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,804
And I've been divorced twice.

682
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,182
I'm buying some property in New York.

683
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,392
Where do you live?

684
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,977
12th Street.

685
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,481
Okay, I'm not gonna
buy property down there.

686
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,693
But I'm gonna get a place
in a nice neighborhood

687
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,196
near the park and you're gonna visit.

688
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,656
All of you.

689
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,117
We'll see.

690
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,327
I don't want to be rigid.

691
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,830
It makes you old.

692
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,168
Can I call you?

693
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,462
Okay.

694
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,054
I got it.

695
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,191
Hello.

696
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,113
Hello.

697
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,950
Loretta let me in on her way out.
I didn't want to surprise you.

698
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,163
No, that's fine.

699
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,373
You know, Sally's not here.

700
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,375
I know.

701
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,337
Can I get something to drink?

702
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,714
Of course.

703
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,383
What do you have in mind?

704
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,552
How about that beer?

705
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,523
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

706
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,366
They have beer over there.

707
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,039
From what I read in the magazines,
they have all the comforts of home.

708
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,336
Sally's mad. My mother's mad.

709
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,129
But you're not.

710
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,007
Look, they're afraid for you.

711
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,218
I am too, honestly.

712
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,221
But you understand why I'm doing it.

713
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,848
Do you want me to say that I like it?

714
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,352
I know you do because I'm brave
and I love this country

715
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,854
and I want to protect it and everyone in it.

716
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,398
Glen.

717
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,029
I know something could happen to me.

718
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,532
But I feel safe because I know you're mine.

719
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,994
Glen, stop.

720
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,916
Why?

721
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,962
Because I'm married.

722
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,763
I'm sorry.

723
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,350
It's okay.

724
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,143
I understand.

725
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,979
You don't.

726
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,065
Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

727
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,859
This was gonna be the good thing
that came out of all this.

728
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,361
This is all I thought about.

729
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,904
Glen.

730
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,906
I know you know me.

731
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,825
I know you know the man I can be.

732
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,412
Glen,

733
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,290
please don't tell me that you did this for me.

734
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,417
I couldn't live with myself.

735
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,004
It's so much worse.

736
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,465
What?

737
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,219
I flunked out.

738
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,179
No.

739
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,641
My stepdad knew I was doing bad.

740
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,144
He's gonna kill me. Kick me out.

741
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,563
After I told him,

742
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,024
he was so proud.

743
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,693
Everything was peaches and cream.

744
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,347
You're going to make it.

745
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,849
I'm positive.

746
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,578
Don't let me fill up on these.

747
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,831
The bus leaves at 8:30.
Will the food come in time?

748
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,667
They must have run out of stray cats.

749
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,544
You're so funny.

750
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,589
- He always says that.
- It's still funny.

751
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,050
What place are you most excited about?

752
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,428
Washington D.C. We're going
to the floor of the Senate.

753
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,763
To protest?

754
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,766
No, we're getting a tour from Senator Dodd.

755
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,644
We're going to find an office for Carol.

756
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,062
You wanna work there one day?

757
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,855
I want to be a senator.

758
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,608
That's impressive. Good for you.

759
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,568
I don't know what I want to be.

760
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,029
You'll figure it out. What are your interests?

761
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,449
I guess I just want to live in New York.

762
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,910
I want to be a translator at the UN.

763
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,870
Yolanda's father is a diplomat.

764
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:23,124
I'm so tired of people
asking me what I want to do.

765
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,128
Well, if you're lucky enough to think
of it, you should write it down.

766
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,963
Because when you get older,
you're gonna forget.

767
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,967
Did you write down "advertising"?

768
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,302
I didn't know what advertising was.

769
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,555
But I wanted to be in New York City, too.

770
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,143
So, where do you live, Don?

771
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,895
Where do I live? The Upper East Side.

772
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,733
In a penthouse?

773
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,735
As a matter of fact, yes.

774
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,238
But he grew up very poor.

775
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,324
And now you have a penthouse.

776
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,201
May I?

777
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,619
Sure.

778
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,123
When I watch television,

779
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,167
the commercials are my favorite part.

780
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,967
So what do you want to do?

781
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,553
I just want to eat dinner.

782
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,474
Nothing like having realistic goals.

783
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,318
Goodbye, Mr. Draper.

784
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,944
Bye.

785
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,196
Thanks for dinner.

786
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,948
Sally.

787
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,117
I'll wave from the bus.

788
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,243
Hold on a second.

789
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,791
It's okay to be nervous about going away.

790
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,585
You can't control yourself, can you?

791
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,378
What are you talking about?

792
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,631
Sarah's 17, you know.

793
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,550
I'm well aware of that, Sally.

794
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,677
But it doesn't stop you.

795
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,888
And it doesn't stop Mom.

796
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,058
Anyone pays attention to either of you,

797
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,060
and they always do...

798
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,896
And you just ooze everywhere.

799
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,900
Your friend's a fast girl, Sally.
I didn't want to embarrass her.

800
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,487
You know what I'm gonna
write down for my dream?

801
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,782
I want to get on a bus
and get away from you and Mom

802
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,077
and hopefully be
a different person than you two.

803
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,578
Hey.

804
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,831
I'm your father.

805
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,084
And you may not want to listen to this,

806
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,378
but you are like your mother and me.

807
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,796
You're gonna find that out.

808
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,300
You're a very beautiful girl.

809
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,054
It's up to you to be more than that.

810
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,501
Bobby, Gene, get back here.

811
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,462
It's time for bed.

812
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,132
I want to watch The Brady Bunch.

813
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,384
Fine.

814
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,470
Give me that.

815
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,951
Hello?

816
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,123
This will just take a minute.

817
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,422
It's done. I did it.

818
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,507
I don't know how, but they're signing.

819
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,259
Right now?

820
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,511
Asking price. Thirty-day escrow.

821
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,680
Really?

822
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,558
Now we have to find a place for you.
