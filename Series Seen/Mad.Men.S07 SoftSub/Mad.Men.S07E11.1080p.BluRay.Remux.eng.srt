1
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,842
Oh, my God. You have to taste it.

2
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,677
Shouldn't we wait for Don?

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,973
Chateau Margaux '53.
Considered by some the best there is.

4
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,643
So, you were talking about Ziploc.

5
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,478
Was I?

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,689
Yes. You were saying that
we might be in the running.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,193
No, I said I was still deciding.

8
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,028
I see.

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,822
So you would like to know
why the agency that has over-performed

10
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,783
on Handi-Wrap, Oven Cleaner,
Bathroom Cleaner,

11
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,660
and Corporate Image Cleaner,

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,495
is worthy of more business?

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,749
Well, I don't know about
Bathroom Cleaner. "Germ killer"?

14
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,084
It makes people think of shit.

15
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,002
You didn't express that.

16
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,173
I expressed ambivalence
and you went the wrong way.

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,512
Yes, of course. So, would you
like us to redo the work?

18
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,682
As I said, Pete, I haven't decided.

19
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,479
Please, Ken, don't get up. I apologize.

20
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,231
I couldn't get a cab.

21
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,151
I should let you try Ken's incredible wine.

22
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,528
But first, I think you should know

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,948
that Ken prefers the
"bright and shiny" bathroom strategy

24
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,410
because he says "germ killer"
makes people think of poop.

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,956
Don't have second thoughts, Ken.
You picked the right strategy.

26
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,708
Okay.

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,209
Okay?

28
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,044
Should we order?

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,009
Good evening, Mr. Draper.

30
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,220
You have three phone calls.
One at 7:00 from Tricia Reynolds

31
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,932
and two from Diana Baur at 9:00 and 9:30.

32
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,059
Diana Baur? What's the message?

33
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,604
I'm sorry, what was the message?

34
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,525
Actually, I see here I wasn't supposed
to give you her second message.

35
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,360
Or her first.

36
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,030
My goodness. Why don't
they just throw these out?

37
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,408
- Do you know who spoke with her?
- Yes, and I'll report this.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,909
I work with birdbrains.

39
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,412
No, it's fine. I just...

40
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,789
Did she leave a number?

41
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,542
No. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,297
Will you let everyone know
I'll pick up my own calls tonight?

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,673
Yes, of course.

44
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,009
And again, I apologize, Mr. Draper.

45
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,510
Good night.

46
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,310
Caroline!

47
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,357
Do you read the mail or
do you just open it?

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,941
Shirley opened the mail. I'll get her.

49
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,403
No, go get whoever is responsible
for paying our lease.

50
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,572
Dawn Chambers.

51
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,451
Joan!

52
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,705
Get in here! Joan!

53
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,209
Don't do that.

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,587
You're gonna have to fire Dawn.
She didn't pay the lease.

55
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,052
I'll take care of this.

56
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,159
I have Trudy Campbell.

57
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,958
Well, hello, Trudy. How are you?

58
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,293
Frankly, not good at all.

59
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,379
What did I do?

60
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,047
No, it's Tammy.

61
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,425
She was on the wait list
at Greenwich Country Day

62
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,344
and they promised her admission,
but they didn't keep their word.

63
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,930
What was she doing on the wait list at all?

64
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,182
My father's entire family
went to that school.

65
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,977
They know who you are, Peter.
And they know who I am.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,979
And they know that we're divorced.

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,731
Greenwich, Connecticut
is built on divorced money.

68
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,318
Don't yell at me. I've arranged
for a meeting with the headmaster

69
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,862
and I'd like for you to accompany me

70
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,281
to show that we're in this together,
if nothing else.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,534
Yes, of course.

72
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,910
Tomorrow.

73
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,705
Just once I'd like some notice.

74
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,708
I didn't want to involve you at all.

75
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,553
You got me this time, Kirby.

76
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,222
You're all fired.

77
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,515
Hold on.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,228
Someone at McCann Erickson
gave notice in writing.

79
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,690
I was never informed.

80
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,817
We were never informed.

81
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,654
Well, it's obviously a mistake.

82
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,657
Get Jim Hobart...
No, Ferg Donnelly on the horn.

83
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,409
Just a minute.

84
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,995
Ladies, this is how rumors get started.

85
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,915
So this stays in this room
till things get sorted out.

86
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,083
Back to work.

87
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,630
I'll get Ferg.

88
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,347
So, now I just want you to play.

89
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,559
Just pretend we're not here.

90
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,947
I'm giving you my permission
to play with all these great toys.

91
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,783
Do what you would do if
we weren't watching.

92
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,121
Really? That's what you'd do?

93
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,251
What's wrong with them?

94
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,711
You said you didn't want actors.

95
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,965
Well, real kids are shy.

96
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,217
And you have to talk to them like people.

97
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,014
They all have their own toy.

98
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,308
If we want enthusiasm,
we should just have one toy.

99
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,060
Like a battle royale.

100
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,771
Just throw one in there, and
last kid standing gets the gig.

101
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,022
It would work.

102
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,191
You hate kids.

103
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,446
You know what? I want to see
how far you can throw that.

104
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,324
Take it easy.

105
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,415
Rog, I'm on my way to lunch.
What can I do for you?

106
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,833
It'll just take a second.

107
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,960
Someone over there accidentally
gave notice on our lease

108
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,128
and I need you to fix it.

109
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,091
Well, actually...

110
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,343
Actually what?

111
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,347
You really need to talk to Jim about it.

112
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,851
About what?
What the hell is going on, Ferg?

113
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,105
Roger, calm down.
I think you'll see it's all good news.

114
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,775
Go ahead.

115
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,236
Well...

116
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,363
We're gonna move your whole office

117
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,865
into our building at the end of the month.

118
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,992
Why?

119
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,119
We don't mind paying people,

120
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,788
but it seems ridiculous
to rent two floors of the Time-Life Building

121
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
when we have plenty of space over here.

122
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,001
Hold on, are we losing the office

123
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,045
or the agency?

124
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,255
That's the wrong way to look at it.

125
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,590
We're bringing you home.

126
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,050
This is my home.

127
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,510
Are you dissolving us?

128
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,013
I'm gonna set a meeting
with Jim for tomorrow.

129
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:56,059
Look, this was supposed to be
the last thing done, not the first.

130
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,691
Were you planning this all along?

131
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,277
Would you stop it? It's going to be great.

132
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,615
Roger?

133
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,247
What do I do?

134
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
Can I help you?

135
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,840
- Really pulled one over on us.
- Who?

136
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,512
What are you doing here?

137
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,848
- Roger, you can't just tell Don.
- Tell Don what?

138
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,058
Do you need ice?

139
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,519
We're not to be disturbed.

140
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,858
- Go ahead.
- No.

141
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,407
McCann's moving us to their building.
We lost our lease.

142
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,450
Everything must go.

143
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,540
So, we're moving?

144
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,292
I'd love a new view.

145
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,503
No, Pete, I don't think
that's all there is to it.

146
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,048
- We're being swallowed up.
- We have 30 days.

147
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,509
SC&P has conflicts. That's why we exist.

148
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,011
Don't you understand? We don't exist.

149
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,471
Our rent is too high.

150
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,063
- Anybody else?
- Yes, please.

151
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,316
That's it? Have a drink?

152
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,986
Well, I'm not going.

153
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,321
You wanna give up the rest of your money?

154
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,657
We all have 4-year contracts
and a non-compete.

155
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
I did not agree to this!

156
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:40,037
Yes, you did. The minute we sold them
the company, we all agreed to it.

157
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,207
After all that, Jim Cutler wins.

158
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,128
All that cash and no McCann.
I hate that guy.

159
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,797
I like it over there.

160
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,216
- Because you're a sheep.
- Knock it off.

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,345
We've got a meeting with Jim Hobart
tomorrow to discuss the details.

162
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,847
Let's try and be dignified.

163
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,016
Keep it in this room until we have orders.

164
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,360
That explains the forecast they wanted.

165
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,655
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,492
They waited so long,
I thought we were safe.

167
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,169
Betsy Wheeler.

168
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,381
Okay, Betsy, I'm glad that's you.

169
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,553
Peggy, may I speak with you?

170
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,305
Maybe later.

171
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,098
It's very important.

172
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,394
I'll be right back.

173
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,285
What's wrong?

174
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,214
I'm telling you this because...

175
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,260
I don't know, because no one else will.

176
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,053
And you really need to know.

177
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,724
We're being absorbed by McCann.

178
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,606
Are they letting me go?

179
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,318
No, they'll need you for a while.
Maybe forever.

180
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,406
All I know is having a leg up on the rats
who fly off this ship is going to help you.

181
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,700
I would want it.

182
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,291
Are you going?

183
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,709
I have to.

184
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,548
I've never worked anywhere else.

185
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,845
You'll do great.

186
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,057
You should get back to work.

187
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,105
For your ears only.

188
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,037
Hello. It's me.

189
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,290
I love a call from you in
the middle of the day.

190
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,126
I just wanted to hear your voice.

191
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,379
Even better. What do you want me to say?

192
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,342
I got some bad news at work.

193
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,344
Hey.

194
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,222
I don't care how bad it is.
It's not that bad.

195
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,683
You don't know that.

196
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,603
We can talk about it
tomorrow when I'm there.

197
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,396
I didn't know you were coming.

198
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,858
Lisa, get me on the redeye to New York.

199
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,861
Now you know.

200
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,123
Melanie called.

201
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,376
She has two two-bedrooms
to show you tonight

202
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,045
and it's five minutes
until the Mohawk status meeting.

203
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,713
Cancel everything.

204
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,757
What's wrong?

205
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,218
It's personal, honey.

206
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,978
Don Draper's office.

207
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,230
I'll see if he's available.

208
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,651
It's Lou Avery calling from California.

209
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,403
Shit.

210
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,115
I better take it.

211
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,410
Do you mind?

212
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,420
- Hello, Lou.
- Don.

213
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,547
I think we need to have a conversation.

214
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,882
Look, we just found out.

215
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,761
I told Dee not to say anything,
but good, you know.

216
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,430
I'm moving next week.

217
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,808
- When did they tell you?
- A couple weeks ago.

218
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,269
I thought about it for 10 seconds,
then I thought,

219
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,520
"So what if it's Tokyo?

220
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,063
"It's my lifelong dream."

221
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,191
They have an office in Tokyo?

222
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,694
They only have an office in Tokyo.

223
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
What are you talking about?

224
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,115
Tatsunoko Productions.

225
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,451
They're making
"Scout's Honor" into a cartoon.

226
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,869
What did you think I was talking about?

227
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,914
It doesn't matter.

228
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,627
They made Speed Racer, Don.
I got a $15,000 advance.

229
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,629
Obviously, my mind's made up.

230
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,465
Obviously.

231
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,884
I wish I could see the look on your face.

232
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,802
I bet you're not laughing anymore, are you?

233
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,220
No, Lou, I'm not.

234
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,057
Well, sayonara, my friend.

235
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,017
Enjoy the rest of your miserable life.

236
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,417
Meredith!

237
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,299
If we're trying to keep the office calm,
closing those curtains is a bad idea.

238
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,554
So spill it. Have you heard something?

239
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,306
Yes, I did.

240
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,599
Lou's moving to Tokyo.

241
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,145
I'm not even going to tell you why
because it would give him pleasure.

242
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,815
The point is Sterling Cooper West is empty.

243
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,526
Of course it's empty. It's the first drop
out of the teapot.

244
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,653
What I'm saying is it's available.

245
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,363
We can run a business out of there.

246
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,198
We have no business.

247
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,033
I was looking at McCann's rosters

248
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,579
and there's going to be a lot of clients
they can't hold on to, conflicts.

249
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,331
Take Sunkist for example.

250
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,667
It's $10 million in billings and growing.

251
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,253
Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid,
so Sunkist is gone.

252
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,004
Burger Chef, it's four million

253
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,090
and they just dumped McCann for us.

254
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,259
They keep telling me
their future's in California.

255
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,137
Exactly. What's our
square footage out there?

256
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,013
1,485.

257
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,432
An old girlfriend measured it.

258
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,685
What I'm saying is
there's business in California.

259
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,103
If we can work out of a bassinet,

260
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,605
we can make McCann money
that they'd have to throw away.

261
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,567
"We"? I don't want to
go back to California.

262
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,403
That's good. You don't have to.
Stay here, they'd like that.

263
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,612
Anyone else wants to stay here?

264
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,614
Are we really playing this game?

265
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,074
Dow Chemical.

266
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,287
McCann fired Ken,
and I mean fired him out of a cannon.

267
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,496
He ain't going near that place.

268
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,456
- How much is that?
- Seven.

269
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,167
But Ken doesn't like us either.

270
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,627
But he loves feeling the tip of your nose
in the seat of his pants.

271
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,837
I'll take care of Ken.

272
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,380
What about Avon?

273
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,757
I'm sorry, but it's not a conflict.

274
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,593
But I have the relationship.

275
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,845
No, that would be stealing a client.

276
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,054
Avon has to go to McCann

277
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,514
and you have to help them keep it.

278
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,102
We're going to hand-deliver
all of the clients they want.

279
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,148
We're meeting with Jim Hobart tomorrow
and we can't cancel.

280
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,775
You think we can secure
three accounts in 24 hours?

281
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,944
We've done it before.

282
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,378
I'm sorry it's so hot in here.

283
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,756
I'm sorry about the intrusion,

284
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,384
but this is the only place
where we know we won't be seen.

285
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,136
Well, I'm comfortable here.

286
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,058
The question is,
how does it look out there?

287
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:44,063
Considering most firms are Ivy League only
and you don't even have a degree,

288
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,023
the landscape looks very promising.

289
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,485
Who wants me?

290
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,695
Well, I can list a bunch of initials

291
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,156
or I could tell you what I really think.

292
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,158
You're the expert.

293
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,160
What's the best offer?

294
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,454
McCann Erickson.

295
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,458
I don't want to go there.
That's why I called you.

296
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,252
I understand that.

297
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:11,632
Look, I'm foregoing a commission here
because I'm a career builder.

298
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,928
I want to help you find a job
over and over again.

299
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,554
And sooner or later,

300
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,599
you're going to have to go
through a place like McCann.

301
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,728
Big company. Big products.
National influence.

302
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,691
You shouldn't stay longer than three years,
but that's where you should go.

303
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,818
But what else is out there?

304
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,444
Plenty.

305
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,906
For a lot less money
with a lot less cachet,

306
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,200
but you go to McCann

307
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,037
and by 1973, you'll be looking
at four times the salary.

308
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,624
So, that's it?

309
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,043
You could've just called
me and told me this.

310
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:52,631
I want you to consider it seriously
before we take meetings

311
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,885
because word always gets out
and McCann is vindictive.

312
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,724
You're really selling it.

313
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,393
It's a huge opportunity.

314
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,282
Come in. Glad you could make it.

315
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,409
- I feel like a spy.
- You look like one.

316
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,705
We have caviar.
Your favorite red, Chateau Margaux '53.

317
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,123
I'll have a snort.

318
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,502
Look...
They're dissolving the agency.

319
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,629
All the business is moving to McCann.

320
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,759
They finally got you. They ate you up.

321
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,349
We know it was hard enough to convince you
to stay when McCann bought us.

322
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,517
I can't imagine
how you feel about things now.

323
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,353
Yeah, I'm not going.

324
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:52,024
So we are proposing that we retain
our independence in our California office

325
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,902
with a few select clients
who've insisted on it.

326
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,654
Who else is going?

327
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,282
Burger Chef and Sunkist so far.

328
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,368
It's strictly for conflicts.

329
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,536
And, well, conflicts.

330
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,081
Tell your superiors
nothing is going to change.

331
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,585
I know I always come at you guns blazing,

332
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,963
but to them, I'm still the new guy,
and Ed's son-in-law.

333
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,216
I can't suggest a move this bold.

334
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,968
Boldness is always rewarded,
am I right, Pete?

335
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,888
I don't wanna make Ken do
anything he doesn't want to.

336
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,642
Now he obviously thinks
it's less bold to change agencies.

337
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,520
You're wrong. Dow would be thrilled
to finally have all their accounts

338
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,979
at McManus, John & Adams.

339
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,858
Kenny, you know that we know
this account inside and out

340
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,568
and we have Don Draper.

341
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,945
That's why you stayed anyway.

342
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,114
That's true.

343
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,449
We've done this before.

344
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,992
You know we can.

345
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:51,041
You know, I fantasized that one day
I'd be in this situation with you, Roger.

346
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,462
And, Pete, well, you're not
exactly an innocent bystander.

347
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,843
I've toyed with you long enough.

348
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,929
No.

349
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,014
Sorry about that.

350
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,119
How do I describe California
in a way that doesn't make them jealous?

351
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,912
Tell them my ex-wife lives there.

352
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,040
Mine, too, so what?

353
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,585
I know you're attached to California.

354
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,379
I don't know what it means to you,
but it doesn't mean anything to me.

355
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,424
It does mean something to me.

356
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,470
I always feel bad about taking your spot

357
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,180
when I saw what happened to you.

358
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,098
It should have been you out there, not me.

359
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
You were very persuasive.

360
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,729
I was misguided.

361
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,235
I met someone.

362
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,449
She's not too young
and she's gorgeous and a little bit deep.

363
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,326
Where'd you find a girl like that?

364
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,745
I knew her in college.

365
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,081
She's divorced, too, but no kids.

366
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,418
I bumped into her on Third Avenue

367
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,421
and we couldn't remember
why it didn't work out.

368
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,467
Congratulations.

369
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,804
I hope you understand, she can't
leave New York and I can't leave her.

370
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,140
Stop it. You're helping us by staying here.

371
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,229
Roger called. Dow's a no.

372
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,356
Let me talk to Ken.

373
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,816
I suggested that
and Roger said it's quite final.

374
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,028
Well, let's comb through
the small accounts.

375
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,447
See if we can cobble
a couple million together.

376
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,366
I'll go get the files.

377
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,749
Do you want more coffee?

378
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,252
I want to get on with this.
I have someplace to be, Trudy.

379
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,886
- Good morning.
- Peter Campbell.

380
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,596
Sorry to keep you waiting.

381
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,813
Well, I assume you know
why we're here, Mr. MacDonald.

382
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,941
We feel there's been a mistake
regarding our daughter, Tammy.

383
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,819
It's a Campbell family tradition to receive

384
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,989
the inimitable education
of Greenwich Country Day.

385
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,907
But you didn't go here.

386
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:33,412
No, but a Campbell has been
in attendance since it was a barn.

387
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,833
I'm sorry, but our decision is final.

388
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,754
Now, Trudy explained to me that
you said it's a question of space.

389
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,008
And I say Tammy would
make it worth your while.

390
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,759
She wouldn't feel extra at all.

391
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,678
It's not a question of space.

392
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,890
Your little girl scored very low
on her "draw-a-man" test.

393
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,853
Well, that's news to us
and I find it hard to believe.

394
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,647
Your ex-wife and I discussed this.

395
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,317
Children have to draw a man,

396
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,903
and their development is assessed
based on the volume of details.

397
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,865
Eyes, nose, ears, 10 fingers,
10 toes, et cetera.

398
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,702
Your daughter had only
a head, mustache, and necktie.

399
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,078
Mustache?

400
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,788
She didn't understand what you wanted

401
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,082
and I've been told
anything beyond a stick figure

402
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,793
is considered advanced for her age.

403
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,172
Albert Einstein didn't speak
until he was four years old.

404
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,215
This is not about your little girl.

405
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,720
The real problem is that your former wife

406
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,348
failed to submit applications
to other schools.

407
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,224
That was careless and arrogant.

408
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,644
- What?
- How dare you?

409
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,229
I think we've said all there is to say.

410
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,274
We're not leaving until
you apologize to Trudy.

411
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,276
Peter, it doesn't matter.

412
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,111
Einstein.

413
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,572
Would you like to step outside?

414
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,492
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
get me while I'm sleeping?

415
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,826
Like a real Campbell?

416
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,578
Are you kidding me?

417
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,914
No MacDonald will ever mix with a Campbell.

418
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,416
What are you talking about?

419
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,544
It's some stupid story. It's 300 years old.

420
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,004
He's obviously nuts.

421
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,132
You should know that his clan
took advantage of the gift of hospitality

422
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,218
and murdered my ancestors while they slept.

423
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,886
The king ordered it!

424
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,556
Just be grateful you can remarry
and get rid of that name.

425
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,938
Come on, Trudy.

426
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,982
Another sucker punch from the Campbells.

427
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,275
Coward!

428
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,283
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
the auditions are finished.

429
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,245
I already auditioned.
I'm waiting for my mother.

430
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,955
Where is she?

431
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,542
She had to pick up my brother.
He has another audition.

432
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,044
Look, Phil, it's a very simple transaction.

433
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,754
We've been doing it for years.

434
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,589
Shirley, will you watch her?

435
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,219
I have every right to be upset
because I'm an important buyer

436
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,804
and you're acting like an asshole!

437
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,891
Maybe we should go downstairs.

438
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,227
I'll see if Marsha's back from lunch.

439
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,187
Do you know your phone number?

440
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,022
Did I get the part?

441
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,735
We haven't decided.

442
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,114
Verna?

443
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,993
Her purse is gone.
They must be at the park.

444
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,286
You should ice that hand.

445
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,872
No, this was a bad idea.
I really should get going.

446
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,125
It was a wonderful idea.
Tammy would love to see you by surprise.

447
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,796
Why did you only apply to one school?

448
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,008
I had a backup, but...

449
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,344
I shouldn't tell you this.

450
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,016
You can tell me.

451
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,938
Well, the head of admissions
was a little fresh with me.

452
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,565
What school?

453
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,859
Peter, you can't punch everyone.

454
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,696
Maybe I should've never left the city.

455
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,656
The city's become a toilet.

456
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:01,036
Well, it's difficult out here.
I don't have a lot of friends.

457
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,872
- I don't believe that.
- It's the husbands.

458
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,124
I don't want to hear this.

459
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,795
Every time I wanna do something,
go into town, any social event,

460
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,171
they won't leave me alone.

461
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,175
Then, I think,

462
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,552
"Who am I kidding? In 10 years

463
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,346
"everyone will leave me alone."

464
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,723
That is not true.

465
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,892
You're ageless.

466
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,271
I'm feeling sorry for myself.

467
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,398
This has been an ordeal.

468
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,944
I'll solve the school problem in 30 days.

469
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,320
All it requires is a check.

470
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,404
Tell Tammy I love her.

471
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,990
You never take no for an answer.

472
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,789
- Actually, can I use your phone?
- Yes, of course.

473
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,004
- Where's Pete?
- He may be meeting us there.

474
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,382
Good, I made it.

475
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,758
You need anything?

476
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,928
Not now. I just talked
Secor Laxatives into joining us.

477
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,890
- Go ahead.
- Were they difficult to move?

478
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,351
All I had to do was not make that joke.

479
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,894
Shall we?

480
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,365
Hello, Susie's office. How many I help you?

481
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,537
Okay. We got three boys, three girls.

482
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,997
Top picks.

483
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,790
She has a lisp.

484
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,335
Lisps are cute.
We could pluck that eyebrow.

485
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,881
You know what? I don't care. You decide.

486
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,384
I know you don't mean that.

487
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,141
Okay.

488
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,103
You can't tell anyone.
You can't even tell Elaine.

489
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,897
That won't be a problem.

490
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,064
Why?

491
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,399
What is it?

492
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,444
McCann's taking over the agency.

493
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,238
We're moving over there.

494
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,074
Jesus, to McCann?

495
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,036
What happened?

496
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,871
I stapled my thumb!

497
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,042
It's okay. I know it hurts.
It happens all the time.

498
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,960
Oh, geat. Go get some ice.

499
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,921
You get ice, I'll pull out the staple.

500
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,089
- No!
- Here she is.

501
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,009
It was an accident.

502
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,678
- What is going on?
- I'll get the first aid kit.

503
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,138
She stapled her finger.

504
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,015
Susie Q, let mommy see.

505
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,727
Very sorry.

506
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,729
We're going to the emergency room.

507
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,022
It's not that bad.

508
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,901
You shouldn't let a child
play with dangerous things.

509
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,987
You shouldn't have abandoned her
in a midtown office building.

510
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,865
It's nobody's fault.

511
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,867
I had to go pick up my son

512
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,702
because your audition ran two hours late.

513
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,330
So you left an eight-year-old
at a job interview?

514
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,666
This is her favorite thing. She loves it.

515
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,210
- And I bet you love cashing her checks.
- Peggy.

516
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,128
You do what you want with your children,

517
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,713
I do what I want with mine!

518
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,305
How the hell did that turn into that?

519
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,057
Fuck her.

520
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,269
I know you got other things on your mind...

521
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,105
Let's just get back to work.

522
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,692
Sure.

523
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,
but you're 20 minutes early.

524
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,668
We just wanted to get everything ready.

525
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,628
For what?

526
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,630
Gentlemen, would you please have a seat?

527
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,056
You see that? We could use
some manners around here.

528
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,891
I don't know about that,

529
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,936
but we're here to discuss everything
we can add to McCann Erickson.

530
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,273
- So are we.
- Go on.

531
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,069
Our agencies complement
each other in so many ways,

532
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,363
but as we considered this union,

533
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,865
we were alarmed at how much business

534
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,825
we'd all be giving up due to conflicts.

535
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,952
There will be casualties.

536
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,121
Sunkist Orange Juice, Burger Chef,

537
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,707
Secor Laxatives, and Tinker Bell Cookies
cannot come along,

538
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,376
$18 million in billings.

539
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,465
But, what if we could service those clients

540
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,551
from the modest offices of SC&P West?

541
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,144
The best part is we'd still be
available to you in any capacity you wish.

542
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,736
California. It's a gold rush out there.

543
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,362
In fact, we've made several...

544
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,989
Don. Don.

545
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,284
Don, stop. This isn't necessary.

546
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,745
Jim, would you let him finish?

547
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,875
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yes, absolutely.

548
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,376
- Do you want this?
- No.

549
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,931
This is $275,000 in
profit, all cost covered

550
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,599
that you don't have to
lift a finger to earn.

551
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,268
Don, sit down. Please.

552
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,159
I'm sick about the way this was handled.

553
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:36,037
It made the whole thing
look very capricious.

554
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,373
I assure you, it wasn't.

555
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,501
And you have to believe me
when I say we're rolling out the red carpet.

556
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,419
We're very excited about this.

557
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,005
You can understand our
attachment to our clients.

558
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,257
And our name.

559
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,176
I don't think you understand
what's happened.

560
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,804
It's done.

561
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,722
You passed the test.

562
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,896
You are getting five of the most
coveted jobs in advertising

563
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,357
and all the resources that go with it.

564
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,944
Travel, adventure.
An international presence.

565
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,700
I shouldn't have to sell you on this.

566
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,911
You are dying
and going to advertising heaven.

567
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,622
Buick.

568
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,377
Ortho Pharmaceutical.

569
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,591
Nabisco.

570
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,516
Coca-Cola.

571
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,986
Stop struggling.

572
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,113
You won.

573
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,873
Take the rest of the day off.

574
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,374
Pop some champagne.

575
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,310
I feel like I should make a toast.

576
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,187
Again?

577
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,314
Well, we didn't drink to Cooper.

578
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,154
Glad he missed it.

579
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,039
Well, I have to go.

580
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,416
Kevin can wait. We should get dinner.

581
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,126
I have plans.

582
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,670
Come back after.

583
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,428
Actually, I'll drop you off.
I should call Trudy.

584
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,222
She had quite a day as well.

585
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,478
We went down swinging.

586
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,858
Don't be a baby. I'll see you tomorrow.

587
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,203
- I'm going to get another round.
- This is my last one.

588
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,789
I have a date.

589
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,295
You never worked at a place
this size, have you?

590
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,796
It's got a lot of advantages.

591
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,215
You never saw the old Sterling Cooper.
It was mammoth.

592
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,341
Not like this.

593
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,805
You're happy about it.
That's okay, I understand.

594
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,973
I'm relieved.

595
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,392
I'm ready to let someone else
drive for a while.

596
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,814
I'd like to make a toast to Lou Avery.

597
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,526
The Japs are going to eat him alive.

598
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,616
What a disaster.

599
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,660
Come on, Joan.

600
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,662
I need you to be the voice
of the bright side.

601
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,335
Hobart listed off accounts
for everyone but me.

602
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,463
Put you on Ortho Pharmaceutical.

603
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,842
No. And I wouldn't count
on anything he said.

604
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,514
I don't know.

605
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,602
For the first time, I feel like
whatever happens is supposed to happen.

606
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,020
That's nice.

607
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,439
That's what you should've said.

608
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,316
Well...

609
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,070
We both know they're never going to
take me seriously over there.

610
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,115
They don't know who they're dealing with.

611
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,049
I can't do any work.

612
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,096
Look, I've hunted for a job before,
and I may not have to,

613
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,722
but I appreciate the warning.

614
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,600
No, I keep thinking about that woman.

615
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,435
Her kid got hurt. She felt guilty.

616
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,145
I know what she felt.

617
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,399
I understand the entire
psychological situation.

618
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,526
She shouldn't have talked to me that way.

619
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,486
She shouldn't have kids.

620
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,363
That's not for you to say.

621
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,282
Jesus, I can't even agree with you!

622
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,828
I don't hate kids.

623
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,831
Look.

624
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,751
You got to a certain point in your life
and it didn't happen.

625
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,837
I understand you're angry about it,

626
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,964
but you've got a lot of other things.

627
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,924
- Don't do that.
- I mean it!

628
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,301
Or you couldn't have done
all you've done otherwise.

629
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,929
I guess that's the secret
to your spectacular career?

630
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,890
- The fact that you don't have kids?
- Not that I know of.

631
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,600
That's funny to you.

632
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,103
Because it wouldn't matter if you did.
You can walk away.

633
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,439
I would never do that.

634
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,024
But you may not even know.
That's what you said.

635
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,529
It's been a long day.

636
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,198
You're right.

637
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,492
I didn't mean to judge her.

638
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,454
But you did and you don't
understand it at all.

639
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,206
I had a mother! And she wasn't great

640
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,460
and I don't know that she wanted me,
so I understand something.

641
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,295
But you don't understand your mother.

642
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,921
Well, maybe I don't want to.

643
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,007
Maybe she was very young.

644
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,594
And followed her heart and got in trouble.

645
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,014
And no one should have to make
a mistake, just like a man does,

646
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,932
and not be able to move on.

647
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,976
She should be able to
live the rest of her life

648
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,561
just like a man does.

649
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,445
You're right.

650
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,405
I know.

651
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,746
Maybe you'd do what you thought
was the best thing.

652
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,879
What did you do?

653
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,096
I'm...

654
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,558
I'm here.

655
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,396
And...

656
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,029
He's with a family somewhere.

657
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,747
I don't know,

658
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,791
but it's not because I don't care.

659
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,963
I don't know because
you're not supposed to know

660
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,216
or you can't go on with your life.

661
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,518
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

662
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,567
Well...

663
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,528
You don't know lots of things
about lots of people. That's the point.

664
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,535
No, it's not.

665
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,581
I'm fine.

666
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,417
I have work to do.

667
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,014
You know, I made a deal with God
that if this worked out,

668
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,099
I would give up smoking.

669
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,602
Message received.

670
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,897
You're a young man
with an incredible future ahead of you.

671
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,944
No more Sterling Cooper,

672
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,404
and no more Sterlings.

673
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,033
Margaret is the only daughter
of an only son of an only son.

674
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,662
All that's left is a
mausoleum at Greenwood.

675
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,665
What's in a name?

676
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,544
Every copywriter thinks
they're Shakespeare.

677
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,297
It's something to aspire to.

678
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,718
I always envied that.
The way you're always reaching.

679
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,263
I always envied you didn't have to.

680
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,432
In another lifetime,
I'd have been your chauffeur.

681
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,685
Then you would've been
screwing my grandmother.

682
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,481
- Do you have somewhere to be?
- I'm afraid so.

683
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,024
Tell her to join us.

684
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,400
She wouldn't like it.

685
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,653
You wouldn't like it.

686
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,739
Now I've got to meet her.

687
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,742
You have.

688
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,620
It's Marie.

689
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,830
Marie Calvet.

690
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,085
You're serious?

691
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,463
Guess I should've asked your permission.

692
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,217
Just warn me before you tell Megan.
I wanna leave the country.

693
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,593
She knows.

694
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,554
Then why didn't you tell me?

695
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,683
I wanted to make sure it wasn't going away.

696
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,227
She's crazy, you know?

697
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,398
When I married my secretary,
you were hard on me,

698
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,901
and then you went and did the same thing.

699
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,949
You know what?
For the second time today, I surrender.

700
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,827
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

701
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,707
You are okay.

702
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,652
Can I help you?

703
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,405
I'm sorry. I must have the wrong apartment.

704
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,701
Kenneth, do you know this guy?

705
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,661
I've never seen him before. I swear.

706
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,708
No. I was looking for Diana Baur.
She used to live here.

707
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,002
Well, we just moved in.

708
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,713
Do you know how to reach her?

709
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,008
She left her furniture.
The manager told us to sell it.

710
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,011
Sorry to bother you.

711
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,888
You want another drink?

712
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,981
Good morning.

713
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,568
What did Caroline say?

714
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,781
They're making lists. Somebody's not going.

715
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,492
The last thing they need
is another office manager.

716
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,285
Or another black girl.

717
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,454
I'm Roger Sterling's second secretary.

718
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,956
Caroline's going to elbow
me out the window.

719
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,083
What are you talking about?

720
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,837
My goodness, Meredith.
We should put a bell on you.

721
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,467
Good morning.

722
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,639
What is going on?

723
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,433
There are rumors flying
like bats around here!

724
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,395
- What have you heard?
- Nothing from you!

725
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,482
Are we going to McCann
and am I going with you?

726
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,192
Meredith, sweetheart...

727
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,069
Don't "sweetheart" me.

728
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,364
In a month,
you're not going to have an office

729
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,449
and you're not going to have an apartment.

730
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,284
Do you want to lose me, too?

731
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,828
I was going to tell you today.

732
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,830
You are coming with me if you want to go.

733
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,500
Now, can I get some Alka-Seltzer?

734
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:35,506
No. It is not a normal day.
Everyone's living in a fright.

735
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,926
You're right.

736
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,679
Get Mr. Sterling on the line.

737
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,061
Marsha.

738
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,233
This is Peggy.

739
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:55,985
It's me.

740
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,903
Where are you?

741
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,448
Locked in my office.
Bourbon with my breakfast.

742
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,994
Did you figure out what you're gonna do?

743
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,913
I'm going to McCann.

744
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,125
Really?

745
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,169
And you can, too, if you want.

746
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,422
You think I should?

747
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,091
Everything's going to be fine.

748
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,847
I'm so dumb, I believe you.

749
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,017
Stay on the phone, will you?

750
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,102
Sure.

751
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,946
Can I have your attention, everyone?

752
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,325
Some of you may have heard already,

753
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,910
but we're proud to announce

754
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,330
that Sterling Cooper & Partners
will be moving to McCann Erickson.

755
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,377
Now, our president, Roger Sterling,
would like to say a word.

756
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,839
We know this news may come as a surprise,

757
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,883
but McCann has assured us the transition

758
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,676
will be as smooth as possible.

759
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,684
They've already set aside room for us.

760
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,024
This is good news!

761
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,611
We didn't do this.

762
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,037
Hold on.
This is the beginning of something.

763
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,539
Not the end.
