1
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,070
l've prepared all of your correspondence,

2
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,160
and the summaries are here
for you to go over.

3
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,120
You can put them down.

4
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,870
Well, it's just... lt's 5:00.

5
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,700
Sorry about that.
You probably want to be leaving.

6
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,170
What are you up to?

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,880
Well, some of the girls from here

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,170
and the traveler's insurance
got a place in Saltaire.

9
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,260
-Mosquitoes.
-They don't bother me.

10
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,340
Some people they bother,
some people they don't.

11
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,480
-l'm just one of those people.
-A thing like that.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,020
ls he making you work
because he's got no place to go?

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,810
-No.
-Have a wonderful weekend, dear.

14
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,280
Why is it that a man on his own
is an object of pity

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,490
when she's really the one
you should feel sorry for?

16
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,950
l don't feel sorry for her.
Those girls do whatever they want.

17
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,860
Still working, Campbell?
There's no reason to show off.

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,660
Cooper's in Montana, Sterling's in Jane

19
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,410
-and Draper's on vacation.
-He's not on vacation.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,510
He's been in Dallas or Denver or something.
Hilton sent him to every armpit he has.

21
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,510
l'd like to get out of town in August once,
even for work.

22
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,600
l love this time of year.

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,890
lt's quiet. lt used to be like this
when l was a kid all the time.

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,390
l'd lie in bed at night, hear horses going by.

25
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,140
New York in August?
lt's like a great, big, melting wax museum.

26
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,070
Nothing but those fat girls
with the hairy armpits

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,400
putting their feet in the fountain.

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,690
You know what?
My weekend doesn't look so bad now.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,740
l'll take anybody for a drink who wants one.

30
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,740
l poured you a beer.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,250
lf you were wondering,
there's a Hathaway in there.

32
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,580
-The hotel gave me someone else's shirt.
-Then you should complain to Mr. Hilton.

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,590
-They should be paying you for this.
-There's a hearing,

34
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,090
and l'm paid well enough already.

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,730
-What are they doing out there?
-Catching lightning bugs.

36
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,560
You should join them.

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,650
Yes, this is Elizabeth Draper
from the Junior League of Tarrytown

38
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,190
calling for Mrs. Howard Englewood.

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,980
We're trying to save
the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.

40
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,280
When do you expect them back?

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,040
Well, that's no good.

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Yes, have a good evening.

43
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,800
Draper residence.

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,760
Just a minute. Don. Come on, Don.
lt's for you.

45
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,810
lt's Mr. Hilton's office.

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,860
This is Don.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,770
Okay. When?

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,620
Tuesday night.

49
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,620
Pan Am? Sure, send it to my office.

50
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,960
You as well.

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,640
-Where are you going now?
-He wants me to fly out Tuesday night

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,140
-and join him in Rome.
-Rome?

53
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,110
-Well, that's a lot better than Dallas.
-Not for two days it isn't.

54
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,860
l'll see the Colosseum from a taxicab.

55
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,740
We should've gone to the beach
for the summer.

56
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,570
You've been gone the whole time, anyway.

57
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,870
First of all, that's not true.

58
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,500
Second, there's nothing stopping you
from coming with me.

59
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,670
-You have a passport.
-l guess our two-month-old isn't an issue.

60
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,300
We can stay at the Waldorf
anytime we want.

61
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,340
-Because that's just like Rome.
-Sorry, Birdie.

62
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,520
l gotta catch up on my sleep.

63
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,660
-Okay, you're all set. stand up.
-I am.

64
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,760
Are you okay?

65
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,980
-Are you trying to get that in or out?
-lt's stuck.

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,850
-You work for the Lawrences, right?
-l'm very sorry.

67
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,450
-You're their au pair, aren't you?
-Yes, but they will send me home.

68
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,200
First of all, let's take care of this.

69
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,800
-What happened?
-l can't tell you.

70
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,760
-Yes, you can.
-l can't.

71
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,380
What's your name?

72
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,050
-Gudrun.
-My name is Peter.

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,440
l'm in 14G.
And l'm not going to get you in trouble.

74
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,450
l have this party and l borrowed her dress
and this happened.

75
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,330
-No one can clean and she's coming home.
-So you thought you would throw it away?

76
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,460
They're just going to think you stole it.
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on.

77
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,210
l don't think you're thinking clearly.

78
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,000
You could put it back in the closet,
and when she takes it out,

79
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,930
blame it on the little kids.
They have a girl, right?

80
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,930
l would never do this.

81
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,510
-When are they coming home?
-Thursday.

82
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,640
-Give it to me.
-For what?

83
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,640
Just give it to me.

84
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,400
-Let me see what l can do.
-Are you sure?

85
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,410
-And people say New York's not friendly.
-Thank you.

86
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,410
Now, l'm not promising anything.
l'll do my best.

87
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,680
Good night.

88
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,170
We've read your statement, Mrs. Gumport,
and we appreciate your concern.

89
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,380
-So where is he? We're next.
-l don't know.

90
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,010
-Did he say he was coming?
-l didn't speak to him exactly.

91
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,680
Maybe he sent a letter,
a proclamation or something.

92
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,810
l believe that completes our old business.
Move onto the new business on the agenda.

93
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,900
We will begin with addressing the gas
station signs on South Water Street.

94
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,690
Excuse me. l believe there's been
a request for discussion

95
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,270
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.
lt's on the agenda.

96
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,410
Somehow that got shifted
into new business.

97
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,040
That's definitely old business.

98
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,110
-Who are you exactly?
-She's with me. l'm Mrs. Jack Farrelly,

99
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,620
and we're representing
the Junior League of Tarrytown.

100
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,460
-Would the trustees please locate the...
-There should be two petitions there.

101
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,550
-Am l late?
-No, you're just in time.

102
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,800
We have someone
who'd like to speak on our behalf.

103
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,190
Yes.

104
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,980
Yes. Mayor, trustees.

105
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,240
l'm Henry Francis, Governor Rockefeller's
director of public relations and research,

106
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,950
and l've been sent here to deliver this
request on behalf of the governor's office.

107
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,580
-Really?
-lt's a request that further study is needed,

108
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,040
because, as you know,
this project was initiated

109
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,790
based on an assumption that
the water quality of the reservoir is lacking.

110
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,370
l don't think that was an assumption.
There was a study.

111
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,840
With all due respect,

112
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,590
the governor's office believes
that was not conclusive.

113
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,340
-May l see that letter?
-l've brought copies for everyone.

114
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,440
Very well, Mr. Francis.

115
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,020
We appreciate the governor's interest
in our hamlet,

116
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,780
and do hereby order the development
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir

117
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,500
be suspended until further notice.

118
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,210
Calm down, ladies.
l believe that completes our old business.

119
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,040
Move onto the new business on the agenda.

120
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,800
l am so impressed.

121
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,960
-So how long will that report take?
-l have no idea,

122
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,100
but there's a saying in politics,
"When you have no power, delay."

123
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,050
-Betty says you're from around here.
-Yeah, about 3 miles that way.

124
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,600
l have to get out of here
before Florence Esterhazi comes out

125
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,990
-and reiterates the financial report.
-l should be getting back as well.

126
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,390
-Are you driving to Albany?
-No.

127
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,230
Well, l'm this way.

128
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,460
-They say you can't fight city hall.
-Good night, Francine.

129
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,240
Well, this is me.

130
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,880
No station wagon for you, l guess.

131
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,670
l have one. lt's just, this was my father's.
l thought it would be good luck.

132
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,470
So.

133
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,600
So what?

134
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,850
Nothing.

135
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,440
l'd love to buy you some coffee,
but l don't think there's any place open.

136
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,990
l appreciate the offer,
but l should be getting home.

137
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,300
l just want to say thank you.

138
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,970
You really...

139
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,390
You really did everything we wanted,
and l know how busy you must be.

140
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,050
Well, l think you'll find
that l put my heart into things

141
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,510
when something's important to me.

142
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,850
Or someone.

143
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,490
That is a beautiful car.

144
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,490
He loved it.

145
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,380
l saw how happy you were in there.

146
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
-l was. l am.
-And l thought, "Dear God.

147
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,140
"Did l have anything to do with that?"

148
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,930
Because that would make me happy.

149
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,100
You did.

150
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,640
-Good night.
-Drive safely now.

151
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,450
Do you know what happened
to the Hilton cufflinks?

152
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,200
They're little Stetsons, sterling silver.

153
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,460
They're in my top drawer.
Bobby was playing with them. They're fine.

154
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,130
-Look at that. How'd it go?
-lt went very well. We won.

155
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,960
We won, we won, we won!

156
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,530
-What time are you leaving?
-Car comes at 5:45.

157
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,490
-You're leaving from work?
-Yes.

158
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,820
-So they just killed the whole development?
-Not exactly.

159
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,410
We had completely forgotten this,

160
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,450
but there's a man
from the governor's office,

161
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,320
and he pointed out
something we'd forgotten,

162
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,660
which was that the whole project
was based on the idea

163
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,300
that the water's no good up there anymore,
which is a lie.

164
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,090
lt's not true at all, not even a little.
They just made it up.

165
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,840
So he ordered another study, you know,
like a chemical analysis of the water,

166
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,800
and that could take years,
so l think they'll move on.

167
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,150
They should just do it up in Newburgh.
lt's already disgusting.

168
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,690
That's real politics.

169
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,150
Well, you know, when you don't
have any power, you have to delay things.

170
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,460
Don.

171
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,020
-l'm up. l'm up.
-No, it's not time to wake up.

172
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,350
l want to come with you. ls it too late?

173
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,230
What? No.

174
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,860
-l can buy you a ticket at the airport.
-Carla can watch them for a few days.

175
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,280
Sure, why not?

176
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,360
l know you'll be working the whole time,
but l just want to get on a plane.

177
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,260
Pardon me. Do you work here?

178
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,460
The men's room is exactly here,
one floor down.

179
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,130
No, l don't need the men's room. l...

180
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,400
l can't return this. lt has this stain here.

181
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,440
l spilled wine on it
and my wife hasn't forgiven me,

182
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,490
and l'd really appreciate
if you could get me out of the doghouse.

183
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,650
l'm sorry, but anyone
could've sewn a tag in this and...

184
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,700
Do l look like someone
who wants to steal a dress?

185
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,000
-l'll pay for it.
-And l was going to say if we did carry it,

186
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,830
it would be from last season,
and l don't know that we still have it.

187
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,470
-Let me speak to the manager.
-Of the entire store?

188
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,680
Of the republic of dresses.

189
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,510
Whoever can help me with this,
because you're falling short.

190
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,430
Just a minute.

191
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,270
-May l help you?
-Yes, l...

192
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,650
Joan! ls that you?

193
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,130
Yes. Yes, it is. How are you?

194
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,090
l'm well. Thank you.

195
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,410
l was asking for the manager. l had no idea.

196
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, l'm just filling in.
They needed some extra help.

197
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,100
-l get my pick before they get put out.
-lsn't that smart?

198
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,600
-So how can l help you?
-Well, l don't mean to be a bother,

199
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,260
l was just hoping someone could.
lt's this dress.

200
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,570
Trudy spilled wine on it.
She's beside herself.

201
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,740
l may have spilled the wine,

202
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,200
and l was hoping to exchange it
or replace it,

203
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,910
whichever will get me out
of the ladies dresses department.

204
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,160
May l?

205
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,910
lt is our merchandise.

206
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,120
-This one's small. l don't see Trudy in a 1 0.
-lt doesn't fit great, but she loves it.

207
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,040
-lt's very...
-lt's very summery.

208
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,760
Give me a moment.

209
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,010
Take this down to customer service.
They'll send someone to the stockroom.

210
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,490
-lt'll be boxed up, but l'm sure we have it.
-l'm willing to pay for it, of course.

211
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,440
-lt's all taken care of.
-Well, that's very generous.

212
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,450
Thank you. So how are you?

213
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,000
Never been better.
How are things at the office?

214
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,750
Moneypenny hasn't self-destructed,

215
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,920
but it's just a matter of time.
And how are you?

216
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,090
l think l told you already. l'm very well.
Greg is just finishing up his residency.

217
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,840
He's actually thinking about
a new specialty.

218
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
You know doctors.
Whatever's the latest thing.

219
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,140
And what would that be?

220
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,670
Psychiatry.

221
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,470
l'll take the dress and you take that.

222
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,010
Thank you so much
for getting me out of a scrape.

223
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,690
And l'd appreciate it

224
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,230
if you should happen to run into Trudy
that you be discreet.

225
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,490
The whole incident was fraught with drama.

226
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,280
Of course. This never happened.

227
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,610
Nice to see you again.

228
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,810
Wow.

229
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,590
lt's beautiful.

230
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,930
-What is that smell?
-Which one?

231
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,100
lt's like rubber or diesel.

232
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,780
l can barely stand up.
Let me see what's going on.

233
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,620
Sorry. l haven't changed my money yet.

234
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,120
No, signore. Thank you.
American dollar is very good.

235
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,820
Thank you.

236
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,830
$2, Don? That's what he makes in a week.

237
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
Don, look.

238
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,310
-I'm sorry. Is this the Drapers' room?
-Yes, this is Mrs. Draper.

239
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,150
ls it? Well, it's high time l got to meet you.

240
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,240
This must be Mr. Hilton.

241
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Connie. Please.

242
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,070
-Welcome to Rome.
-Thank you. l'm happy to be here.

243
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,380
l want you to put my staff
through its traces.

244
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,620
No complaint's too small.
l'd kick you up to a suite,

245
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,290
but l want Don to see the way this works
for most people.

246
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,380
-lt's lovely.
-When I see you tonight,

247
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,960
l want to hear all about it.

248
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,320
l so, so appreciate this.
lt's an hour or two at the most.

249
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,520
The board is trying to jap us
with a sudden meeting.

250
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,440
Ernie, l'm leaving!

251
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,400
You're drinking alone.
This is, in Rome, not in the law.

252
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,160
Whiskey, neat.

253
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,000
-May l join you?
-Yankee. Hey, go home.

254
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,040
lt's an American millionaire.

255
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,920
-Are they making fun of me?
-A little bit.

256
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,230
l'm only in Rome for one night.
l won't have my heart broken.

257
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,870
-Room 763.
-That's right near my room.

258
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,410
Good night, signorina.

259
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,750
-To whatever they were saying.
-They said you were ugly.

260
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,090
Does that bother you?

261
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,680
You think because of the way l'm dressed
that l'm shallow?

262
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,150
l was just hoping you were easy.

263
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,950
-They said that, too.
-What brings you to Rome?

264
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,330
Seen anything interesting?

265
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,670
-l could take it or leave it.
-Well, look at the lovebirds, will you?

266
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,830
Connie, this is my wife, Betty.

267
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,970
By golly, you are an indecently lucky man.

268
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,640
By golly, he's nutty.

269
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,990
He's something.

270
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,400
He adores you.

271
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,830
You're tiny.

272
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,450
He does.

273
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,630
Now l can see
what all the fuss has been about.

274
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,880
He sees great things in you.

275
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,170
-Where are we going?
-We're going for ice cream.

276
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,000
That's a grand idea.

277
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,050
Close your window.
My hair is getting mussed.

278
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
-How was your day?
-Okay.

279
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,100
-Do l look pretty?
-l guess so.

280
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,690
Hey, what are you doing?

281
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,860
Sally and Ernie sitting in a tree.

282
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,820
K-l-S-S-l-N-G...

283
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,100
Shut up! l mean it!

284
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,310
First comes love...

285
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,860
-Shut up!
-Then comes...

286
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,160
Stop it!

287
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,110
-l said shut up!
-Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

288
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,950
-She hurt me.
-He hit me first.

289
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,750
-She was kissing Ernie.
-l was not!

290
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,710
All right! Both of you, separate rooms.

291
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,670
l'm not gonna let Ernie and Jessica
visit anymore.

292
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,700
Well, aren't you a lucky girl?
Go ahead, open it. Make sure it's right.

293
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,790
lt's like new!

294
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,840
They just exchanged it. No questions asked.

295
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,590
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Peter, from my heart.

296
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,710
-l promise l never do this again.
-lt's all right. lt never happened.

297
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,800
We should celebrate.

298
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,350
-l don't know.
-What do you like to drink?

299
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,690
You're German, right?
l can get us some beer or a Riesling.

300
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,730
Schnapps?

301
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,320
You are so nice,

302
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,610
but l have my boyfriend.

303
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,080
Thank you so much to do this for me.

304
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,620
Glad l could help.

305
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,580
Good night.

306
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,920
-l woke you.
-What do you want?

307
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,660
l went to a lot of trouble
to solve your dress problem,

308
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,840
and l think l at least deserve
to see it on you.

309
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,960
Okay, but you have to be very quiet.

310
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,470
-This is cozy.
-l'll go get the dress.

311
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,360
l'd like to kiss you.

312
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,180
-Hello?
-Did l wake you?

313
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,730
-No. No, l'm up.
-Can I interest you two in some breakfast?

314
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,370
Breakfast? Sure, let me just...

315
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,250
Stay.

316
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,410
You know, Connie, Betty's telling me she
already ordered breakfast up to the room.

317
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,990
-Can l meet you afterwards?
-Of course.

318
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,670
You let me know
how you like the room service.

319
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,630
-Did you hear the bells this morning?
-l did.

320
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,350
l like sleeping on this side of the bed.

321
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,580
l have to get up.

322
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,420
Order something. He wants a full report.

323
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,660
Well, hello.

324
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,910
Welcome home.

325
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,580
-How is everybody?
-Everyone's fine. How was your trip?

326
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,910
lt was short but sweet.

327
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,420
Well, good. l'm going to get my things.

328
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,140
Just one more thing.

329
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,630
-You might want to talk to Sally.
-Why?

330
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,770
-She'll tell you.
-Carla, you brought it up.

331
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,980
l keep talking to her about that temper.

332
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,950
l'm gonna go check the mail.
Do you want anything?

333
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,780
She kissed Ernie Hanson. Bobby was
teasing her, and she really went after him.

334
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,160
Okay. lt's okay.

335
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,840
-Thank you for telling me.
-l think they just missed you.

336
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,920
Wouldn't that be nice?

337
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,460
Well, l missed you. You know that?

338
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,810
Mr. Campbell. Ed Lawrence, 14C.

339
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,640
Yes, of course. How are you, Ed?

340
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,700
-ls your wife at home?
-No.

341
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,280
-Can l come in for a minute?
-Of course.

342
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,040
-What are you drinking, Ed?
-l have a martini waiting next door.

343
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,470
Let me make this quick.

344
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,370
You know we have this German au pair
working for us?

345
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,000
-No, l didn't know that.
-Yes, you do.

346
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,510
-l don't know what she said...
-Please, just relax.

347
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,470
l know it's August and all the cats are away,

348
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,780
but l just spent one of my precious
vacation days refilling the Kleenex boxes.

349
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,530
-l don't understand.
-Would you drop it?

350
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,700
l've had four months without any tears,
Mr. Campbell. Four quiet months.

351
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,780
You know how hard it is to find someone
my wife can get along with?

352
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,330
And now this.

353
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,760
Look, there are plenty of nannies
in this neighborhood.

354
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,210
Stay away from her.
ln fact, be smart. Stay out of the building.

355
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,600
-l'm very sorry.
-lt'll be fine.

356
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,720
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

357
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,100
-Bobby, sit down.
-Mayday! Mayday!

358
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,000
Daddy doesn't know,

359
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,580
but Carla told me you were fighting
while we were gone.

360
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,590
Sally.

361
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,010
-Carla was very upset.
-lt's not fair. l didn't do anything.

362
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,680
That's it. You apologize to Bobby
and you learn to control your temper,

363
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,970
or l'm going to have
to start taking things away.

364
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,810
-l'm sorry l hit you.
-That's okay.

365
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,110
l called the office. Hilton sent a packet over
before we even left.

366
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,520
l'm sorry.

367
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,610
-Going swimming?
-Are we?

368
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,280
Yes.

369
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,460
See you tonight.

370
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,230
Yes, but what you really would've enjoyed

371
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,520
was watching my father struggle
with the sailboat.

372
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,150
Well, hello.

373
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,610
Hello.

374
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,240
-ls everybody having a good summer?
-Very nice. Very hot.

375
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,420
l see Marta came.
Or did you keep it this way yourself?

376
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,510
-l did my best.
-My little bachelor. Come over here.

377
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,030
l missed you.

378
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,450
l missed every part of you.

379
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,710
-Trudy, l have to get to work.
-l don't care.

380
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,080
Peter.

381
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,300
You always get that guilty look
on your face when we see little children.

382
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,140
l told you.

383
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,560
l don't care.

384
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,140
You're my husband. l want what you want.

385
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
Did you miss me? A little?

386
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,400
What's wrong?

387
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,010
Peter. Look at me. Did something happen?

388
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,770
-Sally, get down here.
-Coming.

389
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,220
l want you to know that l think
Ernie Hanson is a very nice little boy,

390
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,470
but l don't want you running around
just kissing boys.

391
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,360
-l wasn't.
-And you don't kiss boys. Boys kiss you.

392
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,980
The first kiss is very special.

393
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,650
But l already did it. lt's over.

394
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,780
You're going to have a lot of first kisses.

395
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,700
You're going to want it to be special,
so you remember.

396
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:29,340
lt's where you go from being a stranger
to knowing someone,

397
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,260
and every kiss with him after that
is a shadow of that kiss.

398
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,430
Do you understand?

399
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,400
l think so.

400
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,690
Go play.

401
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,340
-Hello.
-Hello.

402
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,970
l made some cold salads,
hearts of palm, tomatoes, olives.

403
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,980
Wonderful.

404
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,360
-Do you want a drink?
-No.

405
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,690
l walked down Lexington
and they opened a new fruit market,

406
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,070
but other than the melons,
most of it was unremarkable,

407
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,610
so l stopped in Butterfield Market

408
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,490
and they had all of the stone fruits
and beautiful cherries and l thought...

409
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,960
-Trudy.
-...maybe l'd make a fruit salad for dessert.

410
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,910
What?

411
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,080
l don't want you to go away anymore
without me.

412
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,110
Good. l won't.

413
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,460
Tell me, what happened at work today?

414
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,620
Well, Kinsey invented some contraption

415
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,220
that can shoot a water balloon
across the office.

416
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,260
-We filled it with ketchup.
-Did you?

417
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,220
l have $5 for Carla.
She watched the kids for me.

418
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,470
The board called a secret meeting
about the reservoir.

419
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,020
-l think they reversed us.
-Really?

420
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,140
We'll see.

421
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,990
-So did you go to the catacombs?
-No.

422
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,660
Throw a coin in the fountain?

423
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,290
-You did have a good time, didn't you?
-You want some?

424
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,960
The kids didn't eat it at all.
l put them to bed.

425
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,720
Carlton and l went to Lake George
for a week after Jess was born.

426
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,840
No problems, no kids.

427
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,470
lt was magical.

428
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,850
We have to do that again.

429
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,610
l'm afraid we may have to be vigilant
about the reservoir.

430
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,980
Although, it'd be an excuse for you
to get more help from high places.

431
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,520
l'm done with that. We made our stand.

432
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,860
Sunny Madrid. Doesn't that sound
like it would do the trick?

433
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,880
l've never been.

434
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,470
-Welcome home.
-Hello, Francine.

435
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,890
Well, l should be going.

436
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,890
From what l hear,
you two must be very tired.

437
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,510
Good night, Francine.

438
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,910
-Hey.
-Don't.

439
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,740
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

440
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,920
l hate this place. l hate our friends.

441
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,330
-l hate this town.
-Betts.

442
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,220
We'll go away again. You know we will.

443
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,020
Do me a favor. Look on your pillow.

444
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,400
Open it.

445
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,070
l saw it in the gift shop,

446
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,110
but we were leaving,
so l had Connie send it.

447
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,790
lt's lovely.

448
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,910
l'll have it put on your bracelet.

449
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,380
Then l can have something to look at

450
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,840
when l tell the story
about the time we went to Rome.
