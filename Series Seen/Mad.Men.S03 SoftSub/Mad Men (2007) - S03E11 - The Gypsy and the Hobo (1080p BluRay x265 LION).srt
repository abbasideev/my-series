1
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,730
Sally! Bobby!

2
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,900
They sell it at Woolworths.

3
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,120
There's a section that says
"Halloween costumes."

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,660
You'll wear it once.
Plus, it's made out of plastic and it's crap.

5
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,000
-l'm always gonna love Minnie Mouse.
-l'm gonna be an astronaut.

6
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,170
Didn't you hear me? The luggage.

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,300
-l'll go get it.
-That's not the point. They don't listen.

8
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,050
There's more? lt's a week.

9
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,130
We're going for a week?
Are we gonna miss Halloween?

10
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,970
They have Halloween there.
You'll go with your cousins.

11
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,060
Say goodbye to your father,
then get the bags.

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,100
They have a Woolworths in Philly, too.

13
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,650
-l only have $40.
-Swing by the bank.

14
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,000
There should be at least $200
in your checking. That's plenty.

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,960
You have no more money?

16
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,210
Take care.

17
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,760
Roger, l think you remember...

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,460
-Annabelle.
-You look wonderful.

19
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,300
You look exactly the same.

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,360
-This is Annabelle... What is it again?
-Mathis.

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,490
l can't tell if you two
know each other or not.

22
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,320
-Don Draper.
-Hello.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.

24
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,190
How the hell were you in town
and not look me up?

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,170
l wasn't sure about coming back here.
l'm running the company now.

26
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,490
-You divorced what's-his-name?
-No, David died,

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,680
and because of my father's will,
the company went back to me.

28
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,180
-l'm sorry.
-Fifty-one years old. Lung cancer.

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,980
That's too bad.

30
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,070
-So...
-So, yes, if you're open to it.

31
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,650
Caldecott Farms, l'm sure you've heard,

32
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,650
had a public relations crisis
followed by disastrous sales.

33
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,240
-l hadn't heard.
-The Misfits, the movie. Clark Gable.

34
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,460
lt was about horses
being turned into dog food.

35
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,700
-There was an exposé.
-We were singled out. l don't know why.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,420
You don't know why? She owns
a horse farm that makes dog food.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,620
We had a 1 5% share of the market,

38
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,630
but now Benton & Bowles
has dropped us for Gravy Train.

39
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,710
Well, that was a mistake.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,670
People eat cow but they call it beef.
Chicken is poultry.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,010
-Pig...
-We got it, sweetheart.

42
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,640
Well, there is no other word for horse meat.
l thought maybe you could invent one.

43
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,030
-What do you think, Don?
-l think it's a tall order.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,850
-Do you have to use horse meat?
-All dog food is horse meat.

45
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,650
People eat it all over the world.
l've eaten it. lt's delicious.

46
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,160
-lt's like venison.
-l've eaten it.

47
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,320
Well, l'll tell you
what l'm telling the Avenue.

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,200
-Best idea gets my business.
-How long do we have?

49
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,590
l'm in town until Friday,
but only the big firms are rushing.

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,540
Well, l'm not gonna sit here
and brag about how big l am.

51
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,430
Roger.

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,720
Bert, l have two simple rules.

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,730
l don't want to change the recipe.
lt's all meat.

54
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,730
And two,
my father named it Caldecott Farms.

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,520
Don't change the name.
Don't change the product.

56
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,870
-Got it.
-Walk me out?

57
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,790
We had their business before,
but her father was a son of a bitch.

58
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,550
You know, people spend more money
on dog food than baby food.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,630
l'll put the fellas on it.

60
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,380
-ls that really necessary?
-You've never walked in high heels.

61
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,020
No, coming in here.
What are you doing here?

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,150
l wanted to see you,
and l need something new.

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,320
-l'll bet you do.
-For my business.

64
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,360
Besides, you're married, aren't you?

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
-l am.
-Still or again?

66
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,650
-You know it's again. Don't get cute.
-l heard she's a teenager.

67
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,910
Probably too jealous to let you
have a business dinner with me.

68
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,530
-Gonna need a reason.
-Because l know you're good at this.

69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,490
Advertising, l mean.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,210
-Tomorrow night. Somewhere French.
-Avec plaisir.

71
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,920
All the lights were on.
l figured you'd be home.

72
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,800
l knew you were coming over.
Thought it might be dark when l got home

73
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,850
and l didn't want the Mckays
to see you turning on the lights.

74
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,860
That's very thoughtful.

75
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,070
l'm making spaghetti with cream
and butter and cheese.

76
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,290
-And hot pepper?
-Yes.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,120
l had it like that in Little ltaly.
l love that place.

78
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,630
Believe it or not,
l get treated very well there.

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,560
l wish l could take you there.

80
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,810
l know.

81
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,730
Don, l swear l'm not talking
about our future.

82
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,900
-l entered into this with my eyes open.
-l pushed you.

83
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,740
What does it matter?

84
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,170
Here we are, and l look at your life,

85
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,460
and even if l remove myself
from the picture,

86
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,920
l see a man who is not happy.

87
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,300
l'm happy now.

88
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,060
What?

89
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,820
Okay.

90
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,870
l'm going to lie down.
Come get me when you want to.

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,790
Why did l decide to leave surgery?
These last few months have been difficult,

92
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,580
but l found a reserve of strength in myself
l didn't know l had,

93
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,340
and l realized there are other ways
to heal people besides cutting them open.

94
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,420
What experience
have you had with psychiatry?

95
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,600
-That's kind of personal.
-Greg, remember what Steve said.

96
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,390
This is a field about
the most intimate details in life.

97
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,300
More intimate than their organs?

98
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,560
You know, l'm curious
why you won't answer the question.

99
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,190
What is your experience with psychiatry?

100
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,060
None personally,
but my dad had a nervous breakdown.

101
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,770
-l didn't know that.
-Yeah, no one was buying furniture.

102
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,360
My mom ran away for two weeks
because he wouldn't get a Christmas tree.

103
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,330
A headshrinker got him through,
but we weren't allowed to talk about it.

104
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,330
Greg, that's wonderful.

105
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,090
-lt was a lot of things, Joanie.
-No.

106
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,250
Answer like that.
This is a talking profession.

107
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,500
The way you just were with me right now,
so open, he's gonna love you.

108
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,470
The most important thing
about an interview

109
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,510
is to express enthusiasm
in a believable way.

110
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,800
No self-deprecating humor.

111
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,690
You're smart. You're funny.
You're great to be around,

112
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,930
but you haven't decided
if they're the right one.

113
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,440
-This isn't a beauty pageant.
-Well, l've seen executives crash and burn.

114
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,330
l can't believe l never told you that.

115
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,890
l just

116
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,720
wanted more than l thought l would want.

117
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,350
But it'll pass.

118
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,070
Actually, l know for a fact it will.

119
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,950
l don't want it to pass.

120
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,580
One day l dropped the kids off at school
and l saw you in the yard.

121
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,590
l kept wishing you could get in the car
and drive away with me.

122
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,350
Just let it go.

123
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,930
l'll clear my schedule. We can go to Mystic
or something for the rest of the week.

124
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,130
Mystic?

125
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,440
-l can think of someplace if you're serious.
-l am.

126
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,480
Okay.

127
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,910
Damn it.

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
-Hello?
-Roger, it's Joan.

129
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,750
-Joan Harris.
-Jesus.

130
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,640
You're lucky l answered. Ginger's not in.

131
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,850
l know. She has a hair appointment
the last Tuesday of every month.

132
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,130
-She does?
-And I know that your lunch canceled.

133
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
What am l wearing?

134
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,140
So, how are things?

135
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,990
Mr. Hooker has rearranged
the secretaries in the pool

136
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,440
-alphabetically.
-By cup size?

137
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,780
-Well, l know where you'd be sitting.
-You're making me sorry I called you.

138
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,610
l need a favor. l need help finding work.

139
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,530
-Something happen with Dr. Cut-Up?
-Not at all.

140
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,830
He's pursuing his dream
of becoming a psychiatrist,

141
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,750
but that means more training and l just
don't want him moonlighting all the time.

142
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,220
-Why does it matter?
-lt doesn't. None of my business.

143
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,800
-Why don't you come back here?
-Roger, l've been replaced,

144
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,420
and a secretary makes less money
than if l was working at a department store.

145
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,390
l'm so glad you called me.

146
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,310
-l'm sorry it had to be for a favor.
-No.

147
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,570
l like that you thought of me.
You know, to ask.

148
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,060
You want to be on some people's minds.
Some people's you don't.

149
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,030
-That's nice.
-So, do you miss it here?

150
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,530
Are you asking if l miss you?

151
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,700
Well, l guess l am,
because everything else is different.

152
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,200
-l should go.
-Well, how do l work this?

153
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,660
lf l think of anybody.
Just give them your number?

154
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,960
Look at you,
figuring things out for yourself.

155
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,390
Bye-bye, Joanie.

156
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,900
Look who's here.

157
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,780
l'm sorry l missed the funeral.
My grandson was graduating.

158
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,640
lt was beautiful.

159
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,810
Judy fixed lunch.
We don't have to talk right away.

160
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,980
l don't have a lot of time.

161
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,110
Betty wants to know
what the house is worth.

162
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,990
-l'm a lawyer. l'm not a real estate agent.
-Well, the house was left to both of us,

163
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,840
and l don't understand why l shouldn't
be able to buy it away from her

164
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,920
-at double what Dad paid for it.
-They bought it in the late '20s.

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,920
Dad always said
it was the top of the market.

166
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,630
Your father intended you
to get as much money for it as you could,

167
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,010
if you were going to sell it.

168
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,010
Otherwise, somebody
has to buy somebody out.

169
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,690
So, basically Dad gave it to Betty
because he knew l didn't have any money.

170
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,150
This is ugly. You know that?

171
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,950
Milton, l need to speak to you
in confidence.

172
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,710
l need your advice.
l need complete confidentiality.

173
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,350
lt's my husband.

174
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,760
l just found out some compromising facts.

175
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,730
He's been married before, and he...

176
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,370
Well, it's not even his real name,
and he bought her a house, his ex-wife.

177
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,660
l need to know what to do.

178
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,160
l don't know him, Betsy.
l met him at your wedding.

179
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,340
l know your father didn't want him
in the will.

180
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,550
-So?
-What do you want to do?

181
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,330
You want a divorce? ln New York state,
you need to prove adultery. Can you?

182
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,100
-Maybe.
-l mean prove it in a court of law.

183
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,270
That's hard to do. Unless he wants out,
but you're not gonna get anything.

184
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,430
You won't even be able
to buy William out of the house.

185
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,400
You'll have to sell it.

186
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,570
And he can take the children.

187
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,820
That's my legal advice.
You want the rest of it?

188
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,780
-Are you afraid of him?
-No.

189
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,530
ls he a good provider?

190
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,050
He is, but that's not the point.

191
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,050
lt's a lie so big, Milton.

192
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,210
l feel like l've been in some dream
since l found out.

193
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,810
Just saying it out loud to you...
This is the first time

194
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,480
l'm realizing it's true.

195
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,900
You have three small children together.

196
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,150
At least go home, give it a try.

197
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,290
That's what l'd tell my own daughter.

198
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,910
Damn it, Betts! This isn't right!

199
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,010
-Look, he waited.
-This is number three.

200
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,960
What do you want?

201
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,970
l'm going to have one of those lovely wines.

202
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,100
Why did you have two? Are you nervous?

203
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,490
-She'll have one of those lovely wines.
-Bordeaux.

204
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,940
Don wants to call in
a focus group right away.

205
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
That's enough business.

206
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,040
l want to know everything that's happened
in the last 20 years.

207
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,290
Longer.

208
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,540
lt wasn't until years later that l realized

209
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,200
you were the only person
l could remember that time with.

210
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,470
What do you want to remember?

211
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,140
What l was like at that age.
Paris before the war.

212
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,130
Eating in cemeteries.

213
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,810
People were jumping out of windows
and we were on vacation.

214
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,760
l don't remember much.

215
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,400
Are you trying to tell me
when you saw Casablanca

216
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,690
-you didn't think about me?
-You mean Peter Lorre?

217
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,190
You seemed so happy to see me,
and now you're just being drunk.

218
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,000
Look, Annabelle.
We were not in Casablanca.

219
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,630
The only similarity
is that you left me for another man.

220
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,920
When she gets on the plane at the end?

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,750
That woman got on the plane with a man
who was going to end World War ll,

222
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,510
not run her father's dog food company.

223
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,840
You were adrift.
You didn't do anything but spend money.

224
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,720
You walked around like you were hoping
to be a character in somebody else's novel.

225
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,190
The boxing.

226
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,610
l'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your reasons.

227
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,490
Believe it or not, l still remember them.

228
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,490
Jesus, where's the wine?
l don't like the way you're looking at me.

229
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,330
-How am l looking at you?
-With pity.

230
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,540
l finally found a beautiful, carefree girl,
unconcerned about the future.

231
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,620
-l was more serious than you.
-Well, l got mine.

232
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,040
l married Mona, joined the firm,

233
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,500
and then l got shipped off
to the Pacific for the duration.

234
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:19,010
And when l came home, l went to work
while you were watching Casablanca,

235
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,900
and l got blamed when we lost the account.

236
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,320
All l heard was my father said
Bert Cooper had a screw loose.

237
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Look, you're rich.

238
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,320
Let someone else take your horse meat
and slap their label on it.

239
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,770
And do what?

240
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,910
-l don't want a whole bottle.
-l'll help.

241
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,830
And l told him
the closest we ever got to Hemingway

242
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,800
was sitting in a chair he once sat in.
And that was the '20s, not the '30s.

243
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,770
And then he said he remembered me
because l was the one

244
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,560
-who'd introduced him to peanut butter.
-Yeah, l never understood that.

245
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,220
They had peanuts in Europe.
No one ever thought of that?

246
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,860
-Look at us.
-Will you stop?

247
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,280
Roger, do l look like a widow?

248
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,290
You look great.

249
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,290
You still want me.

250
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,040
So what?

251
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,010
l'm married.

252
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,180
Newlywed, honeymooning.

253
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,970
How could l have missed the window
between Mona and her?

254
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,100
There really wasn't much of a window.

255
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,470
-Kind of overlapped.
-l was there first.

256
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,700
We'll just take this and tack it onto that.

257
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,490
l'm gonna get you a cab.

258
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,570
Are you afraid l'll be disappointed?
You were always good drunk.

259
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,500
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.

260
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,080
lt's different with this girl.

261
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,930
l'm sorry.

262
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,420
Good night.

263
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,190
How'd it go?

264
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,160
l screwed up all my answers
and l tried to talk about the articles,

265
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,080
but l couldn't remember anything.
l made a fool out of myself.

266
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,700
-l am sure that's not true.
-You weren't there.

267
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,380
Stop acting like you know everything.

268
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,790
-You'll have other interviews.
-l don't want them.

269
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,340
l don't want to be a psychiatrist.
lt's not medicine.

270
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,890
l might as well work at a bank.

271
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,890
l don't care what you do,
as long as you do something.

272
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,680
We need money.

273
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,020
l did everything l was supposed to do.
Everything they told me.

274
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,470
College, med school.

275
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,560
l wanted to be a surgeon
since l was that big.

276
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,410
l'm sorry, Greg.

277
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,620
-Maybe it's time to move on.
-You don't know!

278
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,250
You don't know what it's like
to want something your whole life,

279
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,000
and to plan for it,
and to count on it and not get it! Okay?

280
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,930
Holy shit!

281
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,920
What the hell?
You're insane, you know that?

282
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,350
Why isn't he wearing a white coat?
He looks like a dog food salesman.

283
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,060
Dogs don't like uniforms.

284
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,360
Well, we're lucky.
Everyone has an appetite today.

285
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,710
They said we should bring them hungry,
but he does seem to like this.

286
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,620
How would you describe
your dog's temperament?

287
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,670
She's picky, and she's nervous sometimes,

288
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,800
-but she's very smart.
-And yours?

289
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,000
He's independent, you know?

290
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,430
He knows what he likes.
He's pretty hard to fool.

291
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,640
-My God, they're describing themselves.
-This your first group?

292
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,190
What if I told you your dogs
were enjoying Caldecott Farms?

293
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,980
-What's it called?
-I wouldn't like it.

294
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,640
-Bingo, stop.
-I've never heard of it.

295
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,030
Well, you should.
They make it out of ponies.

296
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,410
Goodness gracious, that's this one?

297
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,490
This is the first I'm hearing of this.
I wish you would've told me.

298
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,740
-When people are protesting, I'm onboard.
-Well, what brand does your dog prefer?

299
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,580
-Why would you do this to us?
-It's inhumane.

300
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,200
-Bingo looks sick.
-Turn it off.

301
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,240
-Would you prefer beef...
-Could somebody get that?

302
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,500
-l can't turn it off. lt's actually happening.
-Turn off the sound.

303
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,420
l already know how people feel.
lt's yourjob to change that.

304
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,180
Any agency that does not change the name
is stealing your money.

305
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,590
The product is good.
lt's high quality, dogs love it,

306
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,350
-but the name has been poisoned.
-That name got us where we are.

307
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
-Do you think that was just luck?
-l'm not saying a new name is easy to find,

308
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
and we will give you a lot of options,
but it's a label on a can.

309
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,910
And it will be true, because it will promise
the quality of the product that's inside.

310
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,860
Well, l'm gonna wait it out,

311
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,120
and not for these morons,
but for another agency

312
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,760
-to solve my problem.
-Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.

313
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,430
The name is done. lt's unfair, but it's over.

314
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,260
-Annabelle!
-Are you ready for the next group?

315
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,230
-l don't like the way you're speaking to me.
-Everybody out.

316
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,950
-ls this about last night?
-l don't even remember last night.

317
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,910
Well, you threw yourself at me
and l turned you down.

318
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,660
l'm right. You want to hurt me.

319
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,120
No. No, l don't.

320
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,330
You want to know if it was a great time?
lt was.

321
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,510
Do you want to know
if you broke my heart? Obviously.

322
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,230
Well, it was a mistake.

323
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,230
lt's nice to hear,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

324
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,810
lt does to me.

325
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,990
When l was burying this man,

326
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,620
all l thought was, l'd have rather
had my heart broken every day by you.

327
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,900
You were the one.

328
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,460
You weren't.

329
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,640
Well, you're lucky you found her.

330
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,600
Goodbye, Roger.

331
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,900
l think it's about four hours to Norwich,
but the Norwich lnn might be a little past it,

332
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,160
and we can check in till midnight.
We'll be fine.

333
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,430
l'll be right out.

334
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,660
Daddy?

335
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,540
-l'll be right back, Salamander.
-Daddy!

336
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,750
-l left my hat in the car.
-Get it later.

337
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,260
l need to talk to you.

338
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,340
-Go upstairs.
-We want to say hi to Daddy.

339
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,800
Upstairs.

340
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
You're home early.
What did William do now?

341
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,190
Not right now, Don.

342
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,480
Why didn't you just call the office?

343
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,700
l came home to feed the dog
and change shirts.

344
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,910
-l have a client dinner in the city.
-l need to show you something.

345
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,260
-What's going on?
-Open this drawer.

346
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
Betts, that's my desk.

347
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,190
Open the drawer or l will.

348
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,450
Fine.

349
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,120
Betty, this is my desk. lt's private.

350
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,580
Where did you get these?

351
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,460
You left them in the pocket
of your bathrobe,

352
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,830
but l could have had a locksmith
in here anytime l wanted.

353
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,590
l respected your privacy too long. Open it.

354
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,640
No.

355
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,190
You know l know what's in there.

356
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,280
l can explain.

357
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,570
You didn't have to look at my things.

358
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,790
Which things, Don?

359
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,260
The pictures covered
with other people's names?

360
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,960
ls that you? Dick? ls that your name?

361
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,980
People change their names, Betts.

362
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,690
-You did.
-l did. l took your name.

363
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,780
And so did this Anna woman,
whoever she is.

364
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,450
-l can explain.
-l know. l know you can.

365
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,870
You're a very, very gifted storyteller.

366
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,320
Betts, l...

367
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,580
l need a drink.

368
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,420
Are you thinking of what to say
or are you just looking at that door?

369
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,100
l'm not going anywhere.

370
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,790
l'll get you a drink. Just sit down.

371
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,220
You bought her a house.

372
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,570
Where do you want me to start?

373
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,150
-What's your name?
-Donald Draper.

374
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,460
-But it used to be Dick Whitman.
-And who's that woman? Your other wife.

375
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,920
lt wasn't romantic.

376
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,560
l ended up married to her
because l ran away to join the army.

377
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
There was an accident,

378
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,580
and this guy was killed and l was injured.

379
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,780
But they made a mistake.

380
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:59,130
And all l had to do was be him
and l could leave Korea.

381
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,380
Be who?

382
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,050
-Donald Draper.
-You took his name?

383
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,260
Yes.

384
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,550
lsn't that against the law?

385
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,650
Yes.

386
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,700
l found out it was easier to be him

387
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,240
than to start over.

388
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,090
And it turned out he was married
to that woman, so l took care of her.

389
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,210
And then l divorced her
the minute l met you.

390
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,390
You divorced her on Valentine's Day, 1 953,

391
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,220
three months before we got married.
Why didn't you tell me?

392
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,610
-Why couldn't you tell me any of this?
-When? The day we met?

393
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,480
On our first date? On our wedding night?

394
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,360
-Why did you need to know?
-You don't get to ask any questions.

395
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,070
You have a family.

396
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,800
No, l don't.

397
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,010
All this time l thought you were
some football hero who hated his father.

398
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,060
l knew you were poor.
l knew you were ashamed of it.

399
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,140
And l see how you are with money.
You don't understand it.

400
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,470
l was very poor.

401
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,940
Did you see her
when you were in California?

402
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,980
l did.

403
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,830
And she reminded me that l loved you.

404
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,120
What would you do if you were me?

405
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,340
-Would you love you?
-l was surprised that you ever loved me.

406
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,180
Am l supposed to feel sorry for you?

407
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,630
-l don't know.
-You obviously wanted me to know this

408
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,760
or you wouldn't have left your keys, you
wouldn't have kept all of this in my house.

409
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,310
Say something.

410
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,520
l didn't think l had a choice.

411
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,540
And l don't know what the difference is.

412
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,530
This is our house.

413
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,760
-Those are our children.
-Well, there's a big difference.

414
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,890
You lied to me every day.

415
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,510
l can't trust you. l don't know who you are.

416
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,900
Yes, you do.

417
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,440
We're not done.

418
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,510
Betts, l'm in here.

419
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,230
-How is he?
-He kicked his blankets off.

420
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,240
Sit with me.

421
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,880
This was my father, Archibald.

422
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,190
But this...

423
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,020
That's not my mother.

424
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,020
My mother was a 22-year-old prostitute
who died having me.

425
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,870
This woman,

426
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,290
Abigail, Archie's wife.

427
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,790
She raised me.

428
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,050
When l was 1 0,

429
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,370
Arch died and we moved.

430
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,430
And Abigail

431
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,060
took up with him.

432
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,220
Mack.

433
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,650
Uncle Mack.

434
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,570
He was nice to me.

435
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,870
What happened to them?

436
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,540
They're all dead.

437
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,240
Even Adam?

438
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,590
The little boy in all the pictures.
l assume he's your brother.

439
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,480
He was my half-brother.

440
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,890
And he died.

441
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,490
He killed himself.

442
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,300
He came to me because he wanted help,

443
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,460
and l turned him away.

444
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,260
He didn't even want help, he just...

445
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,390
He just wanted to be a part of my life.

446
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,160
And l couldn't risk all of this.

447
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,990
He hung himself.

448
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,800
l'm sorry. l am.

449
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,030
Bob, how are you?
Listen, l've got a favor to ask you.

450
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,030
l know this girl. Actually, you met her once.

451
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,080
Joan Holloway. Well, Harris. Redhead?

452
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,250
Yes, she's beautiful.

453
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,160
Anyway, she's expensive,
but you're always complaining

454
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,250
about needing someone
to whip your place into shape,

455
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,010
so think about it.

456
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,060
l want to help her out.
She's important to me.

457
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,980
Jane's fine. Thanks for asking.

458
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,480
Don't be a stranger.

459
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,550
l'm sorry, Joanie.

460
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,930
And l'm gonna buy you another vase
to put those in.

461
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,510
-l'm gonna buy you a lot of things.
-lt's not about buying things.

462
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,220
l know, l know, but l've been an ass,

463
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,650
feeling sorry for myself
because l couldn't solve this problem.

464
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,690
And it was so easy, Joanie.
The answer was right in front of me.

465
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
l joined the army, Joanie.

466
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,870
You're gonna be taken care of.
We're gonna be taken care of.

467
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,660
And the best part is, l get to be a surgeon.
They need them.

468
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,830
-You joined the army?
-l know l should've asked you,

469
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,290
but l'll do six weeks of basic training.
That's it.

470
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,790
l'll do my residency in New York.

471
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,540
-And then what?
-And then l might have to go somewhere.

472
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,590
West Germany, maybe Vietnam,
if that's still going on,

473
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,060
but a lot of docs don't have to go anywhere,
especially if they have families.

474
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,600
And l'll go in as a captain.
You know what that means?

475
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,320
You don't have to work anymore.

476
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,980
-l don't know what to say.
-Joanie, please tell me

477
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,740
this will make you happy,
because it will make me happy

478
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,200
to give you everything you want.

479
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,650
lt's wonderful, Greg.

480
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,410
And no more soup.
Get your coat. We're going out.

481
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,620
-We should.
-That's my girl.

482
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,270
Do you want something?

483
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,020
Are you gonna have something?

484
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,450
-Daddy, are you going to trick or treat?
-Yes, of course.

485
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,000
l'll see you tonight.

486
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,180
-l didn't think you were coming in today.
-l canceled my plans.

487
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,300
Do you want me to reschedule your lunch
with Jeff Stansbury at United Fruit?

488
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,350
No, l have plenty to do.

489
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,790
-Hello?
-l stopped by earlier.

490
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,960
-No one answered.
-l was running all morning.

491
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,590
-About last night...
-What happened? Did you get caught?

492
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,390
lt's more complicated than that.

493
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,020
So, l suppose l'm not going
to see you anymore?

494
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,300
Not right now. No.

495
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,030
Are you okay?

496
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,030
Only you would ask about me right now.
