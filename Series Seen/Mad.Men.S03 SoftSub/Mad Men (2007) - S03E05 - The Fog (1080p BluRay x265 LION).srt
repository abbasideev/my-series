1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,890
l was expecting the Piersons as well,
but they're not coming. Please.

2
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,980
My goodness. Of course. Here, take mine.

3
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,250
l appreciate that both of you are here.

4
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,510
What happened?

5
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,510
The children were at the water fountain
during gym

6
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,510
and Sally told Becky Pierson
she should save some for the fish,

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,340
and Becky ignored her,

8
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,430
and Sally hit the back of her head
and her face went into the spigot.

9
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,940
And then Becky went after her...
Hair pulling, scratching.

10
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,650
She didn't need stitches in the end,
l understand?

11
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,500
This girl, this Becky Pierson,
Sally told me she's a bruiser.

12
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,320
She's heavy.

13
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,450
The children poke pencils into her sides
when she's sitting

14
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,460
-because they think she can't feel it.
-Sally doesn't do that, does she?

15
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,580
No.

16
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,330
But this bad behavior is new.

17
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,020
l know that you're expecting a child,
but she already has a little brother.

18
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,220
l guess what l'm asking is,
has anything changed at home recently?

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:12,360
My... My father passed away. Last week.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,770
The week before... Two weeks now.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,660
-l feel terrible for bringing that up for you.
-Well, it has not been easy.

22
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,380
ls this Grandpa Gene we're talking about?
That poor thing.

23
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,090
-Sally didn't mention it?
-Why didn't you call us or send a note?

24
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,390
l don't think she missed a day.
Did she go to the funeral?

25
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,070
-Why would we put her through that?
-l don't think children belong in graveyards.

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,100
No, of course not.

27
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,530
Now l realize why she was asking
all those questions

28
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,190
-about Medgar Evers' murder.
-She was?

29
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,030
l'm sorry.

30
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,460
-l have to use the ladies room again.
-We can talk about this another time.

31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,750
No, l'm not as upset as l look.
l can't help this.

32
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,980
-l am mortified.
-lt's not a good time.

33
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,720
No, and it really should be, shouldn't it?

34
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,950
Sally does need more attention.
She's grieving.

35
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,660
There is a very special pain
to losing someone at that age.

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,990
l don't know if you can understand that.

37
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,790
l can.

38
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,630
Mrs. Draper, l was just talking
to your husband and this really can wait.

39
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,050
Are you sure?

40
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,270
Because l just want to put it behind us.

41
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,680
l really just want everything to be okay
when the baby comes.

42
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,560
lt's going to be a beautiful summer.

43
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,700
"Tipped a barman: 75 cents.
Hat-check tip at bar: 50 cents.

44
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,460
"Cab to restaurant: $1 .1 2.
Tipped the cab driver: 38 cents.

45
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,210
"Dinner at Hausner's: $1 9.44."

46
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,790
lt's better to have a bit of Don Draper
than no Don Draper at all.

47
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
l'd like that in writing.

48
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,720
lt seems strange that the two of you
went on the same overnight trip

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.

50
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,890
lf l were lying,
wouldn't l have made it a round number?

51
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,530
-Not that Don's lying.
-l signed his receipts, didn't l?

52
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,990
Which brings us to the undocumented
portion of my assessment.

53
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,500
The amount of pencils, pens, pads,
paper and postage

54
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,830
that are currently being consumed
suit a company four times our size.

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,880
lt has also been brought to my attention
that a credenza has disappeared,

56
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,250
a theft that l believe
necessitates a conspiracy.

57
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,210
People forget that Karl Marx
was the greatest economist who ever lived,

58
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,260
and whatever you think of his solution,
the problem he posed

59
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,020
was about the catastrophic
up-and-down of the marketplace.

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,560
Tell the folks at Admiral
that Karl Marx says everything's okay.

61
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,780
Boom and bust. Bull and bear.
"l need a TV." "l have a TV."

62
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,280
Damn it, Paul,
someone helped Ken cherry-pick

63
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,230
all of Burt's successful accounts
and l've been left with the dogs.

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,940
-Admiral is not a dog.
-Sales are flat. lt's all over their memos.

65
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,370
And now l have to look them in the eye
with nothing. Except maybe new creative.

66
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,120
Stop it.

67
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,430
Now you're interested. There are some
areas of growth, and l mean literally, areas.

68
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,520
Atlanta, Oakland, Chicago,
Detroit, Newark, DC.

69
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,260
Great jazz cities.

70
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,810
And l left out St. Louis and Kansas City,
also growing.

71
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,400
-What does that mean?
-Great jazz musicians?

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,940
Seriously, is it possible that these Admirals
are being bought by negroes?

73
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,660
Lois caught her scarf
putting paper in the Xerox.

74
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,870
Maybe when Joan leaves
l can finally get rid of her.

75
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,500
Can you pretend like you're back
in the media department

76
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,870
and tell me what this says to you?
Look at the cities.

77
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,830
ls it possible that negroes
are out-buying other people two-to-one?

78
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,870
You could jump to that conclusion,
l suppose.

79
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,460
Did you hear about Lois?
You got a winner there, Kinsey.

80
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,390
-Did you see it?
-l did.

81
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,220
So what's everybody doing tonight?
Baby. Married. Kinsey?

82
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,260
Do you want to go to the Mets game?
Tickets and a watch.

83
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,900
-Why, thank you, Birds Eye.
-Does the watch say "Birds Eye" on it?

84
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,820
No, it says, "Hamilton Electric."
What time is it? What time isn't it?

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,530
-Admiral is happy. We're happy.
-They're not happy!

86
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,280
"Morris, comma, in reference
to retooling the factory

87
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,450
"for London Fog children's
and young adults..."

88
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,210
l thought l'd bring you the minutes
to the meeting, since you had to run off.

89
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,340
You're wasting paper.

90
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,930
l'd have to make 1 ,000 to keep up
with your department.

91
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,860
They waste paper because
they throw out bad ideas.

92
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,740
They waste paper because they use it
to sop up spilled drinks,

93
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,700
right after their mid-afternoon naps.

94
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,660
You came here because
we do this better than you,

95
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,120
and part of that is letting our creatives
be unproductive until they are.

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,330
Pennies make pounds
and pounds make profits.

97
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,590
l don't want to talk to you this way.
l've tried it before and it never works.

98
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,620
-You're not usually this emotional.
-You want to make money?

99
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,090
Start getting your nails dirty
with Bert Cooper and Harry Crane.

100
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,680
Clients love to pay for media
and creative needs pencils.

101
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,470
l suppose l hadn't necessarily
thought of it that way.

102
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,930
And lay off of expense accounts.

103
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,940
Think of the men's morale,
not just your own.

104
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,120
You've obviously seen
Bridge on the River Kwai.

105
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,230
l've seen everything.
You have my ticket stubs.

106
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,750
Your uncle Herman is on the line.
He won't leave a message.

107
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,560
Uncle Herman?
My goodness, is Aunt Alice all right?

108
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,340
-Who is this?
-lt's Peter. Dottie's boy. You called me.

109
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,060
-lt's Duck. Duck Phillips.
-Duck.

110
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,110
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.
l didn't want to set off any alarm bells.

111
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,570
My name is Herman, you know that.

112
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,860
Except that l actually have an Uncle Herman
and he's 91 .

113
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,400
That's a sick joke. l apologize.
lt's been too long.

114
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,790
l don't know if you heard,
but l'm at Grey now.

115
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,320
What's that like?

116
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,330
People walking around the halls
all the time, laughing their heads off?

117
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
We're going to have lunch, you know.

118
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,800
l don't know, Duck.
lt doesn't sound like a good idea.

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,170
Campbell, this is beyond
"No hard feelings."

120
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,600
l won't waste your time.
Haven't l always been on your side?

121
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,050
-When?
-I'll have my girl call your girl.

122
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,930
l'll say it's Clorox.

123
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,660
Hello? Anyone home?

124
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,650
l'll get it. Hello?

125
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,870
-Mr. Draper?
-Yes.

126
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:10,050
This is Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher.
l'm not interrupting dinner, am l?

127
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,300
-No.
-l just felt l should call and apologize

128
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,290
about our meeting this morning.

129
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,640
Why?

130
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,980
Well, l...

131
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,060
What l mean is,
my father died when l was eight

132
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,700
and l might have overdone it,
relating to Sally in that way.

133
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,230
I didn't mean to upset your wife, and...

134
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,540
l guess l can get a little caught up in things
and lose perspective.

135
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,760
l don't know why l'm calling.
l'm embarrassing myself.

136
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,180
No, you're fine.

137
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,350
-lf there's anything l can do...
-Don?

138
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,350
Betts!

139
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,180
Thanks for the call.

140
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,890
-lt's time to go.
-Okay, we're going. Let me get my keys.

141
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,660
They're in your hand.

142
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,190
Francine took the kids. Who was that?

143
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,190
No one.

144
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,160
lf you're parked in emergency,
you'll have to move soon.

145
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,670
First, let's make sure it's not a false alarm.

146
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,960
-This is my third time.
-We sent you home before?

147
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,540
No, third baby.

148
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,630
Yourjob's done.
The solarium's down the hall to the right.

149
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,510
Hang in there, Betts.

150
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,810
l came in early to cover for a friend,

151
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,400
so there's a chance l'll see you
the whole way through.

152
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,460
Daddy!

153
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,170
You can scream and yell
as much as you want in this hallway,

154
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,590
-but we're about to pass the nursery.
-Of course.

155
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,060
Excuse me.

156
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,170
l know it's silly, but l seem
to be having trouble with this pen.

157
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,720
-l believe it's empty.
-l gotta go.

158
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,180
Are you planning
to give the baby the breast?

159
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,520
-No.
-Last time you ate?

160
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,400
Lunch. Toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.

161
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,460
Pineapple? What were you thinking?
Anything else, sweetheart?

162
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,380
-Life Savers.
-Has your water broken?

163
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,630
My water never breaks.
When will Dr. Aldridge be here?

164
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,470
Joseph Waddell?

165
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,850
-l'm Dennis Hobart.
-That's good to know.

166
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,820
l haven't seen anybody in an hour.
What's going on?

167
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,560
-Well, we've had a shift change.
-My wife, Pam, Pamela Hobart.

168
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,410
She's fine. The baby's breech.
We're calling in a specialist.

169
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,330
-What?
-Didn't somebody get your permission?

170
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,080
Damn it, what is with you people?
l don't know a damn thing!

171
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,210
Please don't raise your voice.

172
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,130
Now, l apologize,
but we need your permission.

173
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,380
-Do whatever you have to do.
-We'll update you religiously. Promise.

174
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,020
This is not how l pictured it.
Where's all the backslapping?

175
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,860
You know, l brought this because
l thought it'd be a party in here.

176
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,310
-lt's not, but l'll have one.
-Right now?

177
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,060
Whenever you want.

178
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,700
l left work this morning.
l've been here all day.

179
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,410
l am so bored.

180
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,010
l even called in.
Like the prison can't run without me.

181
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,810
-You done this before?
-Twice.

182
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,900
-And yet l never thought to bring a bottle.
-Well, what are we supposed to do?

183
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,070
My daughter took forever.
l remember being pretty worked up.

184
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,370
And the nurse said, "Don't forget.

185
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,590
"Your wife's in the boat.
You're on the shore."

186
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,130
-The other one a boy?
-Yes.

187
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
You throw the ball around?

188
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,650
Not enough.

189
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,500
All right, Mrs. Draper,
l'm going to need you to get on the bed

190
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,330
so l can prepare you for delivery.
This part should be familiar.

191
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,670
l'll shave you
and then give you a quick low enema.

192
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,070
Well, the good news is, time has stopped.

193
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,400
l'd like to have a gold watch one day,
but l can't, you know?

194
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,310
You don't want
to have anything on you like that.

195
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,270
Would they attack you?

196
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,700
l knew it was just a matter of time
before you started with the questions.

197
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,620
l bet you have a nightmare where you end
up in Sing Sing, right? Everybody does.

198
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,910
-l do.
-So what's it like?

199
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,540
You're outnumbered,
but you got the power.

200
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,880
Kind of like being a king.

201
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,720
-Except your subjects want to kill you.
-Maybe, but they don't,

202
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,140
'cause they know l'm dangerous,
and l got a badge, which they respect.

203
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,690
How do they know you're dangerous?

204
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,360
Well, they're not all bad. There's extremes.

205
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,490
We've got death row
and then we've got the baseball team.

206
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,900
ln '29, they played the Yankees.

207
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,360
Everybody in stripes.

208
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,370
You're a funny one.

209
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,040
l tell a lot ofjokes at work.
You hear some doozies.

210
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,210
l have to watch what l do when l leave work,
be careful not to bring it home.

211
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,880
Especially with a kid, right?

212
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,430
Just yesterday l was in A block

213
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,190
and l thought,
"Every single one of these animals,

214
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,450
"their mother had them, they were a baby."

215
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,690
And l think, "There they are,
on the other side of the fence."

216
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,400
And you know what? Every one of them
would blame their mom and dad.

217
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,580
-That's a bullshit excuse.
-That's true, Don.

218
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,590
You have little veins.
Breathe and think about the beauty parlor.

219
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,610
-Do you need to call someone else in?
-lt's in.

220
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,390
The medication will help with the pain
and put you in a twilight sleep.

221
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,520
-Where is Dr. Aldridge?
-He's in the city.

222
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,400
He went to Mama Leone's
for his anniversary. lsn't that sweet?

223
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,040
ls he drinking?

224
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,330
'Cause my Aunt Emma,
her doctor was drunk,

225
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,910
and he ruined her bladder.

226
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,910
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician,
is on duty and will fill in.

227
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,910
-l don't want him. l don't know him.
-He's our top man.

228
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,500
l want Dr. Aldridge.

229
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,090
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

230
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,630
l don't want another doctor.
l want my doctor.

231
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,390
Sit back. You're at 5 centimeters.

232
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,010
That's halfway from here to the Hebrides
and other mountain ranges,

233
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,020
which we are currently studying
in chapter 1 2.

234
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,510
The doctor will be here and there.

235
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
The Hebrides are islands.

236
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,830
Try it now.

237
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,080
Thank you, Sister.

238
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,540
What do you make her for? Sixteen?

239
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,390
Pam was screaming at me in the car.

240
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,060
-l don't think that's unusual.
-That's my girl in there.

241
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,040
lf something happens to her,

242
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,160
l just don't know what l'd do.

243
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,880
And then there'd be that baby.
How could l love that baby?

244
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,340
Our worst fears lie in anticipation.

245
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,550
You're so sure about that?

246
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,640
-l want to go home, you bitch!
-Please relax!

247
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,770
Let go of me! Get your hands off me!
Where's Don?

248
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,400
-He's in the waiting room.
-No, she can't hear you.

249
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,710
The hell l can't. Where is he? Where's Don?

250
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,320
-He's in the waiting room.
-Bullshit.

251
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,380
He's never where you expect him to be.

252
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,920
Have you seen him?
Have you been with him?

253
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,540
Seven centimeters. She's starting transition.

254
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,300
Someone call him. l don't want to be here.

255
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,630
Push the Demerol, 25 milligrams.

256
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
l'm just a housewife.
Why are you doing this to me?

257
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,370
Mr. Hobart? Congratulations.
You have a little baby boy.

258
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,660
-Oh, my God.
-Your wife and your baby are doing fine.

259
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,760
Can l go in? Can l see her?

260
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,410
Not right now. She lost a lot of blood
and had a transfusion.

261
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,460
-What? Please, l have to see her.
-Please, she's in recovery, resting.

262
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,010
But you can go to the nursery and look in
at your son. lt's just down the hall.

263
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,440
Thank you.

264
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,650
A baby boy.

265
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,400
-Congratulations.
-You're all right, Don.

266
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,210
l'm sure yours is gonna be good, too.

267
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,500
You know what? l know it.

268
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,380
Thanks, Dennis.

269
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,590
You're an honest guy.
Believe me. l'm an expert.

270
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,800
Go see your baby.

271
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,760
Why do they put up with us?
You know, we don't deserve it.

272
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,560
This is a fresh start.
l don't know who's up there,

273
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,400
so l'm saying this to you.
l'm gonna be better.

274
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,410
l'm gonna be a better man.

275
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,260
Tell me you heard me.

276
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,590
l heard you.

277
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,230
Don't fight the urge to bear down.

278
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,070
l can't. l can't. l can't do it.

279
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,120
Either you can do it or we will,
but it's going to come out some way.

280
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,330
Daddy?

281
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,540
-Who are you?
-lt's me.

282
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,200
l don't know you.

283
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,960
lt's me, Elizabeth.

284
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,010
You do know me.

285
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,680
-Okay, so it's me.
-What are you doing here?

286
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,480
-l had to go away.
-Well, don't you miss me?

287
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,190
Of course. Listen.

288
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,400
Nobody knows l'm here, okay?

289
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,000
Am l dying?

290
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,870
Ask your mother. Tell her, Ruthie.

291
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,960
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

292
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,520
l left my lunch pail on the bus
and l'm having a baby.

293
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,550
You see what happens to people
who speak up?

294
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,320
Be happy with what you have.

295
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,200
You'll be okay. You're a house cat.

296
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,410
You're very important
and you have little to do.

297
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,610
-She's beautiful.
-lt's a boy.

298
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,780
You look terrible.

299
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,430
-How do you feel?
-l need to put my face on.

300
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,970
You look beautiful, Betts.

301
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,260
-Gene.
-What did you say?

302
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,400
His name is Eugene.

303
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,850
We don't have to decide that now.

304
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,160
Gene.

305
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,710
Did you get any sleep?

306
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,010
No, and l don't expect to
for the next six months.

307
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,680
l wasn't sure where to put it all.

308
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,780
Mr. Draper's office. Please hold.
lt's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?

309
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,190
-Roger.
-Dada.

310
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,040
-Where are you?
-Down the hall.

311
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,370
How's Betty? She perform like a champ?

312
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,300
-She did.
-I need his initials.

313
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,620
Jane's gonna put them on the back
of her yacht or something for him.

314
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,130
No name yet.

315
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,550
There's a lot of guys
twiddling their thumbs down in art.

316
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,630
-Why were you in the art department?
-Lane was.

317
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,720
Apparently, we're all backed up. No one
will move forward without your approval.

318
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,930
-l missed half a day.
-Well, Betty had the baby, not you.

319
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,490
-l'll see what l can do.
-Good.

320
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,070
That guy's a tick.
See you at the traffic meeting.

321
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,500
Can l get some coffee?

322
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,280
You know what it's like in that office.
No one ever buys me lunch.

323
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,920
-l like the turtleneck.
-Really?

324
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,060
-Come. Join us.
-What is she doing here?

325
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,840
Don't worry about it. l know what l'm doing.

326
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,100
-No, you don't.
-Have a nosh.

327
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,140
Two months at Grey
and you're already having a nosh?

328
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,000
l didn't know until l got here.

329
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,120
Look, l woke up one day
and had a realization.

330
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,370
-You two have a secret relationship.
-What? That's ridiculous.

331
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,050
Come on. The way you handled
that Freddy Rumsen thing

332
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,880
so that she could move up?

333
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,310
l've been doing this a long time.
l know what l saw.

334
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
-That's not what happened.
-You can be modest if you want to,

335
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,360
but that kind of focused ambition
is rare in advertising.

336
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,970
Thank you.

337
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,320
l want to take you both with me
to the promised land.

338
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,610
At Grey,
an account man is expected to have ideas,

339
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,910
and creatives are expected to be geniuses.

340
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,080
You'll be sitting on velvet pillows,
showered with riches, awards.

341
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,830
-We're not going anywhere. Well, she can.
-Do we have to go together?

342
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,160
Pete, l know you have ideas
and you're a risk-taker.

343
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Sterling Cooper
is never going to reward that.

344
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,460
Well, thank you. Anything else?

345
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,970
Don't be a baby. You should be taking
meetings like this twice a week.

346
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,690
lf you want to woo me,
you'll have to buy me my own lunch.

347
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,520
-Maybe l should leave, too.
-Why would you do that?

348
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,290
You're so talented.
You should strike while the iron's hot.

349
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,540
-What does that mean?
-lt means the sky's the limit.

350
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,420
No mortgage, no family.

351
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,330
You're a freewheeling career gal
with great ideas. Am l wrong?

352
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,750
-l don't know.
-This is your time, Peggy.

353
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,770
Let me ask you something, Hollis.
What type of TV do you have?

354
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,110
-An RCA.
-Really?

355
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,540
Color? Why did you get it?

356
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,040
-To watch TV.
-But why an RCA specifically?

357
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,410
l didn't see any difference, l guess.

358
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,630
Sixteen. Good afternoon, gentlemen.

359
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,520
A lot of negroes prefer Admiral.
l've done research.

360
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,810
l have an RCA.

361
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,530
-So, do your friends buy Admirals?
-l'm sorry, sir. l can't really say.

362
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,750
Look. This is important and l'd really like
to have an honest conversation with you.

363
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,740
l don't want to get into trouble.

364
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,200
-lt's just us. lt's just Hollis and...
-Mr. Campbell.

365
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,090
Do you think l'm a bigot?

366
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,000
l just want to know
why you bought your TV.

367
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:40,010
-l don't know. l don't remember.
-lt's your TV. lt's a big purchase.

368
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,010
-l don't even watch the damn thing.
-Really? Why not?

369
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,700
Why should l? We've got bigger problems
to worry about than TV, okay?

370
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,940
You're thinking about this
in a very narrow way.

371
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,500
The idea is that everyone is going
to have a house, a car, a television...

372
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,330
The American dream.

373
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,830
-lt's my job.
-Every job has its ups and downs.

374
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,340
You don't watch baseball?
l don't believe you.

375
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,210
-What are you doing out of bed?
-l smelled something.

376
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,260
-What are you making?
-A snack. You want some?

377
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,980
-l didn't know you could cook.
-Mommy's much better at it.

378
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,860
-Are you looking for a chick?
-l am.

379
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,570
Miss Farrell told us about that
when we went to the farm.

380
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,990
But she says those eggs
can never become a chicken,

381
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,830
-even though they come out of a chicken.
-Why's that?

382
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,720
Because they're from the store.

383
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,640
And you know what else?
lf you hold an egg up and it has veins in it,

384
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,770
-you can shake it, then eat it.
-Really?

385
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,690
lt's called addling.

386
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,640
ls the baby gonna live
in Grandpa Gene's room?

387
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,190
lt's not Grandpa Gene's room.
lt's the baby's room.

388
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,450
-l thought it was gonna be a girl.
-Well, l thought you were gonna be a boy.

389
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,180
Not all surprises are bad.

390
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,940
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-That's what Miss Farrell said.

391
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,220
Well, then l guess it must be true.

392
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,800
Burt Peterson's firing was undignified.
Building security. That's all l'll say.

393
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,670
Confirm a couple of rumors.
Did he throw a desk chair against a window

394
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,550
only to have it bounce back
and knock him over?

395
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Not that l know of.

396
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,690
Did he make a number two in a file cabinet?

397
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,820
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.
So, Harry here is an expert in media.

398
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,740
-Television. The air, not the sets.
-Now, Admiral Television sales are flat.

399
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,360
-We know that.
-But as we studied your indices,

400
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,070
we realized that they're not flat everywhere.

401
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,290
ln fact, among negroes,
sales are actually growing.

402
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,340
-We know that, too.
-You do?

403
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,060
No, of course you do.

404
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,140
These are your numbers, but l think
we've discovered an interesting strategy.

405
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,430
This is Ebony.

406
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,570
By negroes, for negroes.

407
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:03,660
Jet. Space in these magazines costs far less
than what you currently spend.

408
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,070
Daily newspapers that go just to this market
for pennies on the dollar.

409
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,670
And?

410
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,330
Shift a portion of the media budget
from lower-indexing white areas

411
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,210
to this market, where it can do more good.

412
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,550
They already like it and we can make them
buy more by increasing the exposure.

413
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,980
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone

414
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,890
would make you the same profit
as a 2% increase system-wide.

415
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,150
And ads on television geared to this market
and white markets

416
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,770
-will have double the effect.
-A negro ad and a white ad?

417
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,240
So, Campbell,
you're making twice the ads for us now.

418
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,620
No, do them together. lntegrate it.

419
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,790
-l don't think that's legal.
-Of course it's legal.

420
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,920
Look, this conversation is not worth having.

421
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,800
Who's to say that negroes
aren't buying Admiral televisions

422
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,680
because they think
white people want them?

423
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,480
-Miss Olson is here to see you.
-Send her in.

424
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,970
Sorry.

425
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,520
l know he doesn't need clothes,
but don't return it.

426
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,530
l'm the youngest. l never had anything new.

427
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,320
-You didn't have to do that.
-l did.

428
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,820
No one told me
they were all going in on it together.

429
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,950
l heard you were back at work,
but now l wonder if that's true.

430
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,660
l invited you in.

431
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,970
l don't know if this is the best time.
l don't know. lt's kind of serious.

432
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,220
l've been thinking about my situation here,

433
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,490
and l'm so grateful to you
for all you've done.

434
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,020
l just...

435
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,620
Well, you know, l'm paid very little.

436
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,820
My secretary doesn't respect me because
l make $71 more a week than she does.

437
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,870
Maybe we need to get you
a cheaper secretary.

438
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,750
Paul Kinsey does the same work that l do,
and not as well sometimes.

439
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,960
And l don't know if you read it in the paper,
but they passed a law

440
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,050
where women who do the same work
as men will get paid the same thing.

441
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,480
Equal pay.

442
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,970
lt's not a good time.

443
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,320
lt's not a good time for me, Don.
Do you know how expensive this city is?

444
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,200
lt's not gonna happen, Peggy, not now.
l'm fighting for paperclips around here.

445
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,590
Third time. lt must be old hat.

446
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,470
-You're gonna be fine, Peggy.
-l look at you and l think,

447
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,940
-"l want what he has."
-Really?

448
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,940
You have everything, and so much of it.

449
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,340
l suppose that's probably true.

450
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,920
What do you want me to say?

451
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,480
l don't think l could have been any clearer.

452
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,520
You see what's been going on here
the last six months?

453
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,830
What if this is my time?

454
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,560
Hey.

455
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,700
-Where are you going?
-To the ladies room. You want to join me?

456
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,900
-Did you tell Don about Duck?
-That's none of your business.

457
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,740
Sure, they hear you're shopping around,
they'll want you more, but me?

458
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,650
l'm sharing my job with Kenny.
l'm already redundant.

459
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,910
You have relationships with your clients.
That's leverage.

460
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,960
-Did you say something?
-lt's my decision, Pete.

461
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
Your decisions affect me.

462
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,440
lf it isn't Martin Luther King.
l should dropkick you off the roof.

463
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:39,160
Admiral Television has no interest
in becoming a colored television company.

464
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,280
But they are. lt seems illogical to me

465
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,920
that they would reject an opportunity
to make more money.

466
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,330
Then again, l'm in advertising.

467
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,840
This is a sensitive issue.
Businesses hate that.

468
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,750
Let me put it in account terms.

469
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,140
Are you aware of the number of hand jobs
l'm gonna have to give?

470
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,560
Am l being taken off the account?

471
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,840
l'm going to have to pretend
l had you killed!

472
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,640
Sales are flat. l had to do something.

473
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,590
l don't know if anyone's ever told you
that half the time

474
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,100
this business comes down to,
"l don't like that guy."

475
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,730
Are we done with the flogging?

476
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,480
Never as good as you think it's gonna be.

477
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,870
lf l may. Bert, Roger,

478
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,080
it does seem as though there's money
to be made in the negro market.

479
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,340
Obviously not with Admiral,

480
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,630
but l don't think it would be wrong of us
to pursue it in some way.

481
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,210
Really?

482
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,460
l've just moved here.
l'm a stranger in a strange land,

483
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,300
but l can tell you
there's definitely something going on.

484
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,390
We'll look into it. You can go.

485
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,770
