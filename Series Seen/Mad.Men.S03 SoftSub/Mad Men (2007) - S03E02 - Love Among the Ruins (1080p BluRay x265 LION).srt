1
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,530
ls there more? l love her.

2
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,700
l saw Susan Watson do it on Broadway,
and she was great,

3
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,790
-but she didn't have that.
-Well, it's not going to be her,

4
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,550
but they want that scene
"frame for frame," as they say.

5
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,850
So, something about how desperate she is
for a Pepsi?

6
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,130
lt's for Pepsi, but it's not for Pepsi.
lt's called Patio,

7
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,680
and it's a dieter's kind of Pepsi
to help women reduce.

8
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,060
lt's Pepsi's diet-right cola,

9
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,220
and there's claims that their lawyers
went over calories, etcetera.

10
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,480
lf we do it right, we land Patio.

11
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,530
And if we land Patio,
l'll be at lunch with Pepsi.

12
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,650
-l think Pete Campbell just broke a sweat.
-l'm coming to casting.

13
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,660
-We're going right to casting?
-You don't have to if you don't want to.

14
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,450
l understand why you like this,
but it's not for you.

15
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,300
-l'm the one who'd be buying Patio.
-You're not fat anymore.

16
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,010
Thank you.

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's assume we can't talk them out
of the name,

18
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,720
and let's assume we can get a girl
who can match Ann-Margret's ability

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,100
-to be 25 and act 14.
-ls that what she's doing?

20
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,260
ls it just a knockoff?
Are we allowed to make fun of it, at least?

21
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,930
-She's fun and sexy. Don't be a prude.
-Would you say that to me?

22
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,690
-lt's sexy, and it's what they want.
-Clients don't always know what's best.

23
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,980
When we land them,
you can start talking to them that way.

24
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,290
Pick it up.
Bobby, back away from the stove.

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,510
We're out of Melba Toast.

26
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,300
Jesus, Betts, have some oatmeal.
That baby's gonna weigh a pound.

27
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,500
Carla must have had some,
because l would have thrown the box away.

28
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,880
Are we gonna collect the whole set?

29
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,800
l thought you didn't mind her
doing the legwork.

30
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,110
You didn't need a decorator last time.
l'd like to feel like l'm paying for something.

31
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,530
-These are $3 apiece, you know.
-And l can't really judge by a picture.

32
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,900
l'm late.

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,950
We should really spend a day in Tarrytown.
lt'd be so easy.

34
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,410
-No.
-Those stores smell bad.

35
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,610
We are going to Tarrytown.

36
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,630
And you're gonna stare
at some antique chair for so long

37
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,880
the buttons are gonna seem interesting,
and then we'll go to Carvel.

38
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,760
See you tonight.

39
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,290
What are you doing?

40
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,850
l hope you received the package
showing our campaign

41
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,100
to ease the way
for the Ravenswood nuclear power facility.

42
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,970
Kinsey was responsible for that.

43
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,690
Almost a year,
and nary a peep of opposition.

44
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,360
lt was very impressive.

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,030
l've told Paul that you're facing
an onslaught of negative public opinion

46
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,240
in your attempt to demolish
the Pennsylvania Railroad Station this year

47
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,580
and replace it
with the new Madison Square Garden.

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,450
We should have torn the damn thing down
during the newspaper strike.

49
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,530
No one would have noticed.

50
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,960
Now, let's take a look at the landscape,
as it were.

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,390
"How to kill a city.
Architects' inhumanity to architects

52
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,570
"surpasses understanding.
The new design is also ambitious,

53
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,650
"pedestrian and dull."

54
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,860
Ada Louise Huxtable
is as green as that folder.

55
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,580
People know that she's an angry woman
with a big mouth.

56
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,200
Who writes for The New York Times.

57
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,320
l don't care if she wrote
for the Ten Commandments.

58
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,580
She's trying to sell papers doing what
they always do. Making people miserable.

59
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,000
My great-great-grandfather, Silus Dikeman,
would have turned his boat around

60
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,340
if he had known that this city
would one day be filled with crybabies.

61
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,000
So what's your best weapon
against lunatics?

62
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,420
Fifteen stories, vaulted ceilings,
pink Milford granite columns.

63
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,300
l don't think it's crazy to be attached
to a beaux-arts masterpiece

64
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,560
through which Teddy Roosevelt
came and went.

65
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,400
l've met the opposition. l know crazy.

66
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,850
Do you know where
the greatest Roman ruins are?

67
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,450
They're in Greece, Spain,
because the Romans tore theirs all down.

68
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,700
They took apart the Colosseum
to build their outhouses.

69
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,670
This is the Colosseum.
Have you seen the plans?

70
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,630
In The New York Times.

71
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,880
-Do you have a problem, buddy?
-He's looking for an angle.

72
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,640
You know those snide ad men
you see in the movies?

73
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,850
Right here.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,090
Well, l've got a mailbox full of death threats
from beatniks like him

75
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,690
who'd rather live in a teepee.

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,930
This is the greatest city in the world.
lf you don't like it, leave.

77
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,310
Well, we'll let you know.

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,980
You have no problems
with an atom plant on the East River,

79
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,110
-but this bothers you?
-lt's Penn Station. This city has no memory.

80
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,660
Out with the old, in with the new.
Who says that's a good idea?

81
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,710
l'm going to have to talk to Don about this.

82
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,920
Don't do that.

83
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,930
Look, now they'll trust me more
when l help them.

84
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,380
Do you ever listen to yourself?

85
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,340
l hate you, you know that.
Other than Wilma Flintstone,

86
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,390
l haven't seen anyone carry so well.

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,780
lt's smoke and mirrors.
l've busted plenty of seams.

88
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,400
Well, it makes me optimistic.

89
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,160
Greg has made it perfectly clear
that come July 1

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,700
and he's chief resident,
l'd better watch out.

91
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,290
-Hello, Mrs. Draper.
-Can you get Mrs. Draper a glass of water?

92
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,120
Why don't you tell me first
how long l'm going to be here?

93
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,450
What's so urgent?
London Bridge falling down?

94
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,490
ln a manner of speaking.

95
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,760
-l appreciate you stopping by.
-Didn't you just call us into your office?

96
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,180
Well, yes.
l thought it best if l told you in person.

97
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,560
l just heard from London.

98
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,180
We've been sacked
by Campbell Soup, Great Britain.

99
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,720
l don't want to have to walk down here
every time we lose an account.

100
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,690
This is an advertising agency.
l'll wear out the carpet.

101
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,830
lt's not so much the account we lost
as the account we failed to gain.

102
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,070
-So now BBDO has all of Campbell's Soup?
-Why didn't we have a meeting with them?

103
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,740
Perhaps l should drag Burt Peterson in
and fire him again?

104
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,450
-Obviously Don would've loved a shot.
-How did this slip through the cracks?

105
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,710
l don't usually set meetings, l attend them.

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,930
Well, if this is where we wanted to end up,
we all did everything perfectly.

107
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,770
You ever get three sheets to the wind
and try that thing on?

108
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,300
Mrs. Pryce is here.

109
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,140
Nothing to fret about, as long
as there's new business. Five minutes?

110
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,330
-lt's definitely side to side.
-ls that a boy or a girl?

111
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,860
l'll call my mother.

112
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,750
Look. Princess Grace
just swallowed a basketball.

113
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,380
-How are you, Roger?
-lt's not hard to adjust to happiness.

114
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,710
Shall we?

115
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,230
Good night, Mrs. Harris.

116
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,810
l'm in a foul mood.

117
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,400
Château Lafite Rothschild, '49.
l'm very impressed that you have this.

118
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,610
Not bad at that.

119
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,500
-Where are you living?
-We have a furnished flat in Sutton Place.

120
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,290
Three bedrooms,
spectacular view of the river.

121
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,760
And we're near the UN,
so there's plenty ofAfricans.

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,380
Like the Bordeaux grape,
may we all get better with time.

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,260
This is delicious.

124
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,110
Rebecca was curious
if you knew anything about schools.

125
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,030
ln the city, l'm a little out of touch.

126
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,870
How long have you been together?

127
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,830
-Ten years.
-Nine years.

128
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,120
Fifteen for us.

129
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,800
-Do you miss London?
-God, yes.

130
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,870
But what we lost in London
we gained in insects.

131
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,310
J. Walter Thompson
is opening an office in Caracas.

132
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,810
l don't know if the ladies
want to talk about that.

133
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,640
No, of course not.

134
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,320
The coquilles. Brilliant.

135
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,910
Look, l didn't want to be there
any more than you did.

136
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,860
lt was just the cherry on top of my sundae.

137
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,250
What?

138
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,200
Tell me now,
and not three seconds after l've dozed off.

139
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,160
l've been trying to get my father
on the phone.

140
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,170
Of course l called William and, again,
something's wrong.

141
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,930
Another stroke?

142
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,770
-Gloria left him.
-Can you blame her?

143
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,930
Yes, l can blame her. She came into his life,

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,100
he suddenly takes ill
and she abandons him.

145
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Maybe she realized he's a son of a bitch.

146
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Don, l'm worried about him.

147
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,610
He doesn't sound right,
and l can't take a car trip now.

148
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,340
l think William and Judy
should bring him up this weekend.

149
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,220
-Great, more antiques.
-lt's spring break. lt'll be nice for the kids.

150
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,960
-Those girls are a nightmare.
-They'll leave by Saturday at the latest.

151
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,390
Why did you even bother asking me?

152
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,990
She's really kicking.

153
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,530
-Mr. Sterling, your family is here.
-Send them in.

154
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,920
lf it isn't fall bride.

155
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,590
-Where's Brooks?
-He'll be along.

156
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,090
-Would anyone like anything? Coffee or...
-lt's 1 0:30.

157
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,760
Sherry, if you have it.

158
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,850
l told Brooks to come late.
l don't want him to be embarrassed.

159
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,900
By what? That l'm paying for everything?
You just tell him that's the way it's done.

160
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,020
No, Roger, it's about Jane.

161
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,690
What about her?
lt was her idea to take you to Dior.

162
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,410
Why haven't you returned her calls?
You're hurting her feelings.

163
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,920
l know what you think.

164
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,910
You think it's so uncomfortable
that l won't even bring it up.

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,660
Well, you're being very dramatic
for a girl who didn't want a wedding at all.

166
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,040
Do you want me to say it?
Do l have to say it?

167
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,540
Say what, exactly?

168
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,960
l've suggested to Margaret a compromise.
You and June host your own table,

169
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,640
-and l'll be at the Hargroves'.
-So, you get the in-laws and l get Siberia?

170
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,470
Are you worried about an odd number?
Because l'll get your mother a date.

171
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,310
-l have a date.
-Who?

172
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,730
-Bruce Pike.
-What does that old saddlebag want?

173
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,830
l didn't want to go to her wedding,
but l did.

174
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,370
-The least she can do is not come to mine.
-Not come?

175
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,330
-That's why l suggested a compromise.
-You're not even giving Jane a chance.

176
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,410
Seeing her on my wedding day
is gonna ruin it.

177
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,950
She's young enough to be my sister.
How does it look?

178
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,710
-Sweetheart.
-Brooks! Thank God.

179
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,340
Mom.

180
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,050
-How are you, sir?
-Not great, Brooks. Not great.

181
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,930
Can l get you something?

182
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,480
-No.
-That's okay. l'll have yours.

183
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,560
-Roger.
-We're not married anymore, you know.

184
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,890
l like the silver and the bells.

185
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,030
Go with the bells. November 23rd.
l'll tell Jane.

186
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,460
Mr. Pryce is here to see you.

187
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,970
Send him in.

188
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,710
Your wife is charming.

189
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,800
-She lifted Rebecca's spirits inestimably.
-l'm glad to hear it. They really hit it off.

190
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,780
l hate to send you into the lion's den,
but l think it best you take the gentleman

191
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,810
from Madison Square Garden
to a nice lunch today.

192
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,990
Peter and Paul rubbed him
very much the wrong way.

193
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,990
-l told you before, Roger's the lion tamer.
-Roger will join as well.

194
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,150
lt will help if you tell me
who these people are.

195
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,950
All l could secure was Edgar Raffit,

196
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,590
vice president of Madison Square Garden,
and he's irate.

197
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,080
What does he want?

198
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,930
A Cyrano de Bergerac
to make New York fall in love with him.

199
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,600
-Today?
-Do you have plans?

200
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,640
Have Campbell send over the folder.

201
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,610
They're wild lndians.

202
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,490
They've been cooped up since Woodbridge.

203
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,450
l fixed some lunch.

204
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,500
-Cold roast chicken, or l have cold cuts.
-We went to Pat's Steaks.

205
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,210
l got you a half.

206
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,710
-Have you all already eaten?
-No, we waited.

207
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,260
-l even got Gloria a chicken parmesan.
-Well, great. We'll mail it to her.

208
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,310
She's in Boca Raton.
She's not coming back.

209
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,390
He understands completely.
He's just playing it up.

210
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,640
-How was the drive, Daddy?
-ln the Lincoln?

211
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,160
You should take your Coumadin
with your sandwich.

212
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,740
So l said to them, "lt's so crowded in here,
l feel like l'm on the subway."

213
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,300
l've never seen anyone like you on the train.

214
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,340
Well, my husband won't let me.
lt's a figure of speech.

215
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,040
Have a seat,
and l'll let Mr. Pryce know that you're here.

216
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,030
Sorry about that. l got tied up.

217
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,230
What else do you have to do today?
What else do you have to do all week?

218
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,190
l barely made it here.

219
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,280
Ginger presses the buzzer,
says, "Your family's here."

220
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,380
Sounded silly. Gibson, up.
That's gonna help.

221
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,290
To my knees, Don.
They're bringing me to my knees.

222
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,040
-Sorry to hear that.
-l made my bed, l should lie in it, right?

223
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,380
Your words, not mine.

224
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,650
Like it's not hard enough
losing my little girl to that kid.

225
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,270
l've got her mother
pouring poison in her ear.

226
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,570
There's a land grab going on.

227
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,570
l blame Mona.

228
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,160
All of a sudden,
l could give two craps about that wedding.

229
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,750
-All l want to do is win.
-Gentlemen.

230
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,000
-A pleasure to meet you. Roger Sterling.
-Edgar Raffit.

231
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,760
-Our creative director Don Draper.
-Edgar.

232
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,750
Have a seat, please. Let's get you fixed up.

233
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,520
l only have a minute.

234
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,850
Edgar, please.
Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.

235
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,270
l understand one of our copywriters
took a Yetta Wallenda-sized misstep.

236
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,990
The girl, the tightrope walker.

237
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,190
They got her off the sidewalk
with a hose last week.

238
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,530
The point is,
we completely understand your problem.

239
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,840
-All we want to know is how we can help.
-You're supposed to tell me.

240
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,910
Well, l've done all l can. Don?

241
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,890
ln the interest of time,
you want to demolish Penn Station

242
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,850
-and New York hates it.
-Not all of New York. A vocal minority.

243
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,380
Can they stop it?

244
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,430
Well, l think all the hubbub
is making it unpleasant for...

245
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,940
But they can't stop it, can they?

246
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,480
Why do you people insist
on making us sound like villains?

247
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,270
Your concern over public opinion
shows a guilty conscience.

248
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,230
Now what good is that serving you
if what is to be done is already underway?

249
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,690
Leave those.

250
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,120
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges,
blue cheese, bacon.

251
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,960
So let's say
l don't have a guilty conscience.

252
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,420
Good. And let's also say that change
is neither good or bad, it simply is.

253
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,250
lt can be greeted with terror orjoy.

254
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,550
A tantrum that says,
"l want it the way it was,"

255
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,350
or a dance that says,
"Look. lt's something new."

256
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,850
-Would you draw the line at 50%?
-l'm not drawing a line at all.

257
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,270
PR people understand this,
but they can never execute it.

258
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,950
lf you don't like what is being said,
change the conversation.

259
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,750
What is that conversation?

260
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,830
l was in California.
Everything is new, and it's clean.

261
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,890
The people are filled with hope.
New York City is in decay.

262
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,220
But Madison Square Garden...
lt's the beginning of a new city on a hill.

263
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,390
-Just like that?
-lt's true, isn't it?

264
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,060
lf l were to come to you,
l don't want that kid on my account.

265
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,610
-The communist, the radical.
-l will handle it personally.

266
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,030
Grandpa Gene is going
to watch his program now.

267
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,120
l just want to catch the end of the game.

268
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,970
-Move.
-And the first pitch of the ball, outside.

269
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,770
-Daddy seems well. He has an appetite.
-He eats constantly.

270
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,110
When l found out Gloria was gone,
l was hoping he ate her.

271
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,370
-How could you not know about that?
-l went by, but he lied to me.

272
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,330
Then, finally, when l let myself in,
he went bananas.

273
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,860
He's ashamed.

274
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,160
Judy can get through to him.

275
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,880
He's down in the dumps,
but he seems very clearheaded.

276
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,380
That's not true, Judy, and you know it.
He's angry, and he's in and out.

277
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,890
There is this place, the Parker Home.
lt's midway between us, in New Brunswick.

278
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,300
And what happens there?

279
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,930
He lives there.
lt's got everything, plus doctors.

280
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,480
lt's expensive, but l thought
maybe we could sell our house.

281
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,120
You know.
That would give him enough to live on.

282
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,990
That's very generous.

283
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,280
-Do you think he belongs in a home?
-Betty, l know l don't get a vote.

284
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,660
-Neither does Don.
-All you care about is the house.

285
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,300
You want to walk in there,
see Daddy on the bottom of the stairs,

286
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,350
and have his last words be,
"Take the house."

287
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,340
Fine, Betts. What's the solution?

288
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,480
Those homes are for people
who don't have families, William.

289
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,940
-He's a lonely old man and he's not well.
-He's your father.

290
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,000
-Gene.
-Thanks for the ritzy accommodations.

291
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,550
You're an army man, Gene.
Drop your socks and grab something.

292
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,990
Lights out at 8:1 5. l'm impressed.

293
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,360
l wish you would hang your coat up
downstairs. lt's covered with soot.

294
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,830
-How bad is he?
-He's not the problem.

295
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,920
What am l saying? He's the whole problem.
That, and William's never-ending bullshit.

296
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,260
-What now?
-He wants to put him in an old folks' home.

297
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,480
Well, l understand it's not ideal,
but it is the next logical step.

298
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,810
Don, he just wants the house.

299
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,940
He keeps nailing himself to the cross.
For all l know, Judy's pushing him.

300
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,540
Cut it out!

301
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,780
What do you want to do?

302
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,630
How can he talk that way to me
in the condition l'm in?

303
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,960
-Do you want anything?
-Just throw it on the chair and stay here.

304
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,690
Be careful.

305
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,520
l'm fine.

306
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,870
lt's so funny how she is.
My father and her fought constantly.

307
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,040
She never remembers that part.

308
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,830
-Family is important to her.
-l care about family.

309
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,670
You know, Don had nobody
at their wedding. Nobody at all.

310
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,400
Why can't we just move in with him?
l'll take care of him.

311
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,030
lt's bad enough to work for him.
l'm a 30-year-old man.

312
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,990
l don't want to have somebody tell me
l have the wrong tie on.

313
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,020
Raffit is sending over every piece of paper
they have on the new Garden.

314
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,070
He wants you to see these new drawings.
Apparently they're right out of Metropolis.

315
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,810
-He talk about television?
-l have a meeting on the books.

316
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,610
He talked a lot about radio. And Kinsey.

317
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,450
You're gonna have
to keep a low profile on this,

318
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,870
-but it doesn't mean you're not working.
-Mr. Pryce is here to see you.

319
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,830
l didn't realize
you were in the middle of something.

320
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,880
Did you come to treat us
to a little new-business lunch?

321
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,580
May l speak with you in private, Don?

322
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,810
-Can l get you anything?
-No, thank you.

323
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,230
Bad news, l'm afraid.
l just got off the phone with London.

324
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,320
There's a problem
with Madison Square Garden.

325
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,320
-Did their check bounce already?
-Unfortunately, there's a conflict.

326
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,530
Did you tell them it's a stadium
in the middle of New York City?

327
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,580
-lt's one of a kind.
-They know exactly what it is, a project,

328
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,070
and they told us to turn it down.

329
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,550
-l'm confused.
-lt's a question of economics.

330
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,340
Servicing Madison Square Garden
will require an account man,

331
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,050
at least two copywriters, two artists,

332
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,840
an ombudsman for City Hall,
all against 200,000 in billings.

333
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,010
That's for right now.

334
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,600
Precisely. From what l understand,
groundbreaking is at least two years away.

335
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,760
Madison Square Garden
is our way into the World's Fair,

336
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,060
the largest trade show in history.

337
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,360
Plus, there's the Garden itself.
Hotels, concerts, sports.

338
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,730
-This could mean 30 years of business.
-They're not interested. l'm sorry.

339
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,280
You told me to go out and get this account.
l did. l did my job,

340
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,620
and now you're telling me
it's all for nothing

341
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,300
because you forgot to check with
your boss first? Who's running this place?

342
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,090
l know this is difficult.
l take full responsibility.

343
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,330
Why the hell did you buy us
in the first place?

344
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,800
l don't know.

345
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,070
Tell Mr. Campbell
Madison Square Garden is dead.

346
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,910
-Do you have a second?
-Can it wait?

347
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,030
No.

348
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,320
Sal sent up the storyboards.

349
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,160
-What is this?
-lt's Patio, the diet drink for Pepsi.

350
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,620
Yes. Everyone wants a drink
that sounds like a floor.

351
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,890
This is Chinese.

352
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,840
lt's all one shot,
like the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.

353
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,390
-l haven't seen it.
-Well, this is an Ann-Margret type.

354
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,270
Fine.

355
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,270
You really haven't seen it?
You see everything.

356
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,840
We have a few versions of a song,

357
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,960
and the boys are very excited
about finding this girl.

358
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,300
l'm sure.

359
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,430
Don't you find her voice shrill?

360
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,300
She's throwing herself at the camera.
lt's pure.

361
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,640
lt makes your heart hurt.

362
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,640
No one seems to care that it speaks to men,
not the people that drink diet drinks.

363
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,360
What do the geniuses at Patio want?

364
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,940
Maybe we should be talking about how
this is better than coffee or Dexedrine.

365
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,400
lt's not about making women feel fat.

366
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,240
This is, "Look how happy l am
that l drink Patio.

367
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,700
"l'm young and excited
and desperate for a man."

368
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,800
l don't mind fantasies,
but shouldn't it be a female one?

369
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,670
Peggy, l know you understand
how this works.

370
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,100
Men want her. Women want to be her.

371
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,420
-Even if that's true...
-lt is.

372
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,730
l'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.

373
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,970
Well, you know,
if we were making a movie or a play,

374
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,980
we'd be embarrassed to do this. lt's phony.

375
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,850
You're not an artist, Peggy.
You solve problems.

376
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,370
Leave some tools in your toolbox.

377
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,540
Could you hold that?

378
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,050
-Heading home?
-Yes.

379
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,430
Let me ask you something.
You're a young girl.

380
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,860
Excuse me?

381
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,780
You're the only one around here who
doesn't have that stupid look on her face.

382
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,610
What does that mean?

383
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,330
What would your father have to do
for you to not want him at your wedding?

384
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,920
-My father passed away.
-There you go. You'd do anything.

385
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,080
Hello.

386
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,520
lt's so crowded in here,
l feel like l'm on the subway.

387
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,150
Where's your drink?

388
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,960
Don. Don't worry about this.
lt's under control.

389
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,050
-Hey, where's Mom?
-She's upstairs.

390
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,240
-l'm going out for a bucket of chicken.
-What's the matter?

391
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,530
-l'm a horrible daughter.
-No, you're not.

392
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,780
William says these are the options.
We put him in a home,

393
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,950
or they move in with him
and Judy is his nurse. Judy.

394
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,960
William says?

395
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,050
He's probably right.

396
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,760
-William!
-Yeah, Don?

397
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,680
Go get the chicken in a minute.

398
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,690
Can l speak to you a minute?

399
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,580
-Jesus. What year is this from?
-l don't care.

400
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,740
Look, Don, we're all upset.

401
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,840
One thing l've learned from this,
don't get old.

402
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,260
-About your father...
-Man's a real jackpot.

403
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,250
He always said he didn't want
to be a burden, yet here we are.

404
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,630
This is what's going to happen.

405
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,680
You're gonna explain to your sister
and your wife

406
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,400
that we have reached an understanding.

407
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,190
You are going to support
your father financially,

408
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:56,730
and l am going to take him into my house.
His house will remain untouched.

409
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,200
l appreciate the advice, Don.
l'll take it under consideration.

410
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,320
You're gonna go out there
and you're gonna tell your sister

411
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,490
that this is what you want.

412
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,280
We'll pretend that you did the right thing
on your own.

413
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,950
-He's my father!
-And he's in my home.

414
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,120
l want you to leave tonight,
and l want you to leave the Lincoln.

415
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,840
-l can't have him here without a car.
-Are you kidding me?

416
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,090
How are we supposed to get home?

417
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,980
New York Central.
Broadway Limited from Penn Station.

418
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,970
lt leaves in two hours.

419
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,570
You want him? You got him.

420
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,000
-Dad, we have to talk.
-l could eat.

421
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,130
No. Daddy, William has something to say.

422
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,260
All of us, we've been trying to figure out
a way we can help you live better.

423
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,420
l'd be doing all right if people left me alone.

424
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,090
Daddy,

425
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,890
-Don and l want you to live here with us.
-Elizabeth.

426
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,230
Honey, l'm not that blue.

427
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,770
Just for a while.
l think you need a little vacation.

428
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,120
So the animals are running the zoo?

429
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,910
We're not selling the house,
and you're gonna have your car.

430
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,620
The plans, the plans, the plans you make.

431
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,390
You know you want to get out of town.
You'll be with the kids.

432
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,810
Betty is a better cook. You always say that.

433
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,530
-Well, l should've been the first to go.
-Daddy, don't talk like that.

434
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,870
We should go pack.
Girls, start getting your things together.

435
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,470
lt's nice, right? lt's called a stinger.

436
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,290
-l don't know what's in it.
-lt's delicious.

437
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,060
l'm graduating from Brooklyn College
next month.

438
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,350
-What are you studying?
-What?

439
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,770
-What are you studying?
-Do you want one?

440
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,190
-l'm afraid you're gonna bite my hand.
-l'm sorry.

441
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,040
l just need to eat.
My mom says l'm still growing.

442
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,320
l gotta work on my manners.

443
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,040
l started pre-law,
but switched to engineering. More jobs.

444
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,220
Really? Those are so different.

445
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,470
You've gotta figure,
if we're all gonna be replaced by machines,

446
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,600
might as well be a guy
that makes them, right?

447
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,100
Or you could just become a robot.

448
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,440
-Are you in school?
-l work at an ad agency, Manhattan.

449
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,570
Wow. l don't know how you girls
do all that typing.

450
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,410
-And l work for a jerk.
-We're hitting the road. You got cab fare?

451
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,940
What are you talking about?
l live around the corner.

452
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,900
That's right. He does.

453
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,170
You're funny.

454
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,750
Do you have... You know.

455
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,000
-What?
-A Trojan?

456
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,050
No.

457
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,770
l can't.

458
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,330
Jeez. lt's getting pretty late.

459
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,460
Well,

460
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,670
there are other things we could do.

461
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,660
Did you hear that?

462
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,870
Gene.

463
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,330
The heat is on.
We got to get rid of this stuff.

464
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,590
You got anything else around, go flush it.

465
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,930
-You're leaving?
-l have to work tomorrow.

466
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,650
-You want to get breakfast?
-lt's the middle of the night.

467
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,240
-Where do you work again?
-Madison Avenue.

468
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,120
Right.

469
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,580
Well, you know,
l hang out at that place a lot.

470
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,580
Okay.

471
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,440
lt's the bottom one.

472
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,020
Thanks.

473
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,320
This was fun.

474
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,650
Parents, friends, and family,
l'd like to welcome you all to field day.

475
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,700
l hope you can appreciate
how hard the children have prepared

476
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,000
in all kinds of weather.

477
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,840
Scott?

478
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,300
"The tradition of the maypole
dates back over 500 years,

479
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,340
"and is celebrated all over the world.

480
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,570
"We erected our maypole
for Ossining's sesquicentennial.

481
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,900
"We dance around the pole
in a timeless celebration

482
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,660
"of the renewal of springtime."

483
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,030
