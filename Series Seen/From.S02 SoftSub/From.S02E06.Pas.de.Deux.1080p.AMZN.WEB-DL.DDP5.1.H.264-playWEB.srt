00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:10,793
<i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:13,839
Those things out there...

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,146
They like to hunt.

4
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:18,018
They like to play.

5
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,628
Stop smiling!

6
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:22,022
You'll feel better,
if you come outside.

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,720
I can't fucking
do this anymore.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,984
I feel like I saw that piece
of her start to slip away.

9
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,333
Then it has to be you.

10
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,682
<i>You have to be
that piece of her</i>

11
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:32,684
<i>that this place
can't take away.</i>

12
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,165
We don't have much time.

13
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,384
I need you to kill me.

14
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:42,999
My blood
is your blood now.

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,655
<i>What if I'm not
the same anymore?</i>

16
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:50,876
You're still you.
I'm still me.

17
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,836
The rest of it,
we'll figure it out together.

18
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,361
What is she doing here?

19
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,884
She might be helpful
for us to find out

20
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,060
what we're looking
for out there.

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,235
No one can know
she's with me.

22
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:03,367
She killed my dad!

23
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,239
They tore him to pieces
and you knew!

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,067
Kenny, please.

25
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,807
You watch
your own fucking six.

26
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,640
I was hoping we could talk.

27
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,950
I'm not really
sure where to start.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,739
I want you to know that
my decision about Sara,

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,872
I believe in my heart
is for the good

30
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:31,569
of everyone
in this town.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,832
But that doesn't
mean that I--

32
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,576
What she did,

33
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,231
what she took from you,
from Kenny,

34
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,711
it doesn't matter
why she did it.

35
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,455
I understand if you...
you hate me for protecting her.

36
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:51,111
For keeping her a secret.

37
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,201
I know what it's like
when this place--

38
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,820
when it, uh,

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,257
takes somebody that you love.

40
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:08,737
I just--

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,914
Listen.

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,268
Since I got here,

43
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:21,402
I've tried to make
people feel safe.

44
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,622
I thought, if there's rules,

45
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,755
if we just stick
to what's right.

46
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,806
Here's what I know.

47
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,765
Things are changing,

48
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,462
and if we don't use
everything we have,

49
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:41,073
every little thing, I...

50
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:46,818
I need to do
whatever I can

51
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,168
to get these people home,

52
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:51,649
to get you and Kenny home,

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,434
even if it means...

54
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:54,783
Ma.

55
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,048
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,400
Okay.

57
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,793
Huh?

58
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:05,924
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:07,839
No, no, no. It's okay.

60
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,450
It's okay.

61
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,625
I just--

62
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,149
Thanks for your time.

63
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,720
You okay?

64
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,476
Sara? We--

65
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,679
- Oh, sh--
- Boyd?

66
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,073
Hey!

67
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,161
Hey, hey.

68
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:55,120
You okay?

69
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:02,737
Sorry, I just--sorry.

70
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,046
Okay. Okay.

71
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,790
Oh, sorry about that.

72
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:16,098
No, you, um,
you should get that looked at.

73
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,448
Oh.

74
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,580
Sorry to be a bother.

75
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,278
You take him see Kristi.

76
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:23,932
Mm-mm.

77
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,803
No, no. I'm okay.

78
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,283
I'm--I'm fine. Thanks.

79
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,590
I'm okay. Thank you.

80
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,769
Yup.

81
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:37,946
All right. Okay.

82
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,295
- No, no.
- All right. All right.

83
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:42,603
Okay, let's go.

84
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,606
Okay, thanks.

85
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:46,781
Yeah.

bringing some of this back.

112
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:14,624
This ready to go?

113
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:15,930
Yeah, let me give you a hand.

114
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,105
I got it.

115
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,761
Trouble in paradise?

116
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,463
- That the last of it?
- Yup.

117
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,291
That's everything.

118
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,687
We're gonna be fine.

119
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,037
We all keep our heads,
stick to the rations,

120
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,778
we'll get through this.

121
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,303
We're gonna be dealing with
this most of the night

122
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,652
down at the Liu house,

123
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:45,220
so I need you
to oversee the lock-up.

124
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,702
Remember, make sure
cans on all the doors.

125
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:52,140
Hey, um, what do we tell
people about the food?

126
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,446
Oh, for now?

127
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,537
As little as possible.

128
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,409
Just say, uh...

129
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,545
we're working
out a new system.

130
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,807
We don't want anyone
to panic.

131
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,160
You guys gonna be all right?

132
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,816
Yeah.
Yeah, we got this.

133
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:48,283
Hm.

134
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,044
Hey, have you
seen the--

135
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,046
What is this?

136
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,439
You went
through my bag?

137
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,224
I was looking
for a hair clip.

138
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:19,793
Look.

139
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,709
It's just--You said that

140
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,101
you were going
to see your aunt.

141
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,234
That's why you were on the bus,
to see your aunt.

142
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,670
Yeah, because I didn't
want you to...

143
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,760
It's not a big deal.

144
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,936
Not a big--
You lied to me.

145
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,373
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

146
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,463
Everything's under control.

147
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,466
You were on your way to rehab
and you ended up here.

148
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,686
There's--Nothing about
that is under control.

149
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,863
I mean, you were doing so well,
I don't under--

150
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,305
When did you start
using again?

151
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,959
Don't say it like that.

152
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,178
I'm not--

153
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,749
It's just been
a few months.

154
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,800
This is
'cause I disappeared.

155
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,280
It was because
of a lot of things.

156
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,065
Look, I was gonna tell you,
I just--

157
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,153
Fuck.

158
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,546
Where are you going?

159
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,680
Where are you going?

160
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,639
No, don't do that,
you don't have to do that.

161
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,162
Listen to me!
We have a very limited supply

162
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,121
of medication here,
and what we have is vital!

163
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,688
I can't risk
anything going missing!

164
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,080
This doesn't have to
be a big deal, okay?

165
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,517
I was already gonna stop,
so we can just do it here.

166
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,172
We can do it now.
This doesn't have to be--

167
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,826
Can you please just stop
and talk to me!

168
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,959
Shit! I got it!

169
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,134
Would you just please
stop doing that!?

170
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,744
Doing what?

171
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,052
Stop panicking like I'm some
junkie who's gonna like--

172
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,489
You know,
this is why I didn't tell you.

173
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,056
Did you take anything
from here?

174
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,624
Tell me the truth.

175
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,546
It was just
a little bit of morphine

176
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:03,374
so I could even myself out
a bit. That's all.

177
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,333
Okay? You can put
it back in the cabinet.

178
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:06,508
I'm not gonna take anything--

179
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:07,988
Marielle.

180
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,428
Yeah, fine,

181
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,082
Do whatever
the fuck you want!

182
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,866
- Where are you going?
- For a walk!

183
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,520
So you can hide
all your valuables from

184
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,609
your junkie-ass girlfriend!

185
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,654
You can't go outside.
It'll be dark out soon.

186
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,746
Fuck you!

187
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,015
Yeah, I noticed that myself.

188
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:39,497
Leaves changing colors,
falling off the trees.

189
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,848
Never seen that before.

190
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,111
Yeah.

191
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,550
Look...

192
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,421
Kenny,
I-I know that--

193
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:53,860
You know, um,
you look like you're--

194
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,776
you're walking better now,
so I'm...

195
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,473
um, you've probably
got it from here.

196
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,869
God damn it!

197
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:05,697
Boyd, what happened?

198
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,003
It's starting to hurt now.

199
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:12,008
You can't always see them,
but I can feel them now.

200
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,316
Boyd, what are--
What are you talking about?

201
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,752
Look, I-I can't...

202
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,668
When I went out
to the forest,

203
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,714
something happened
to me out there,

204
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,412
something I don't understand--

205
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:30,070
I got something--
something in me now.

206
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,942
Worms, they're crawling
underneath my skin.

207
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,770
And--And--

208
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,950
You--
You hear that?

209
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,174
Boyd?

210
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:49,654
Boyd!

211
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,444
Boyd, where are you going?

212
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,405
What's going on?

213
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,357
Boyd?

214
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,490
Did you see her? She--

215
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,113
We should go.

216
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,116
It's gonna get dark soon.

217
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,336
Yeah.

218
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,344
Here, man.

219
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,391
Thanks, Ellis.

220
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,610
Of course.

221
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,137
Hey, let's, uh,
hang those at the front.

222
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,269
Yup.

223
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,191
Hey.

224
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,540
- Hi.
- Can I help?

225
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,541
- Nope.
- No?

226
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:34,890
- Done.
- Yeah. Cool.

227
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,413
How are the windows?

228
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,198
Uh, they're covering up
the last of them now.

229
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:39,373
Great.

230
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,852
Hey, hey.

231
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:43,899
We okay?

232
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,727
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

233
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,037
Huh.

234
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,821
One thing at a time here, Boyd.

235
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,518
You're not listening
to me. It's not--

236
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:55,606
What?

237
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,304
It's what he did.
It's what he did.

238
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:00,002
That's what I'm trying to--

239
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,569
Okay, so you're saying
someone did this to you?

240
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,006
Yeah. Look. Here.

241
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,356
Here.

242
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,750
He cut me here,

243
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,448
and then he put
his bloody wrist

244
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,670
up against my arm and said,
"My blood is your blood now."

245
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,628
And then whatever
was inside of him

246
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,414
came out of him
and went into me.

247
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,545
And then...

248
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,245
and then
the place disappeared.

249
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,855
Boyd--

250
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,422
Look, I--
There's nothing I can say

251
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,641
that makes this sound logical.

252
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,686
Okay.

253
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,645
I got worms under my skin.

254
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,647
And--And--
And it feels like something--

255
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,693
like something's
coming for me now. It's...

256
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:43,480
Boyd, I don't--
I don't see anything.

257
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,309
The guy who did
this to me, all right?

258
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,269
Whatever these things are,

259
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,011
they had been feeding
on him for years.

260
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,491
And he passed it on to me,

261
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:56,058
because they
wouldn't let him die.

262
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,192
You imagine that?

263
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,804
It was so bad that
all he wanted to do was die.

264
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,113
All right, you...

265
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,158
you don't have to
believe me right now.

266
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,813
I just need you to
promise me that if this--

267
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:13,771
if things get bad, if I...

268
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,647
Hey, promise me.

269
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,519
That you--

270
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,696
you'll put
an end to things

271
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,307
before it goes too far.

272
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,659
Boyd, what are you
asking me to do?

273
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,926
I don't wanna die
like Martin died.

274
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:48,806
So I guess you're
staying the night.

275
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,331
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,507
I just--
I figured, you know.

277
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,248
I hope that's okay.

278
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:56,988
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

279
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,339
Did he tell you
about the worms?

280
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,211
Yeah.

281
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,910
Did you see anything?

282
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,522
You mean, did I see anything
crawling under his skin?

283
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:11,177
No, but he's been
through a lot.

284
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,278
You know, this is how it--

285
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:28,803
this is how it started
with my dad back home.

286
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,763
There would be moments
where he'd just seem like

287
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,591
a completely different person,

288
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,028
say things that
he would never say.

289
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,597
We'd rationalize it.

290
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,426
Say he was just tired,

291
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,080
say he was under
a lot of stress.

292
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,346
Then one day he just...

293
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,479
Hey.

294
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:54,481
It's too early
to start worrying

295
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,222
about things
like that, okay?

296
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,963
I mean, there are cases
where Parkinson's can lead

297
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:02,576
to dementia, but it happens
way later on, 'kay?

298
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,187
But it does
happen though.

299
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,409
Yeah.

300
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,326
Like this?

301
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:16,807
Remember, only two tablespoons
of salt per jar.

302
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,810
We've got a limited supply,
we gotta make it last.

303
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,595
Well, how long is it
gonna last like this?

304
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:24,163
We do things right,
it should keep to a year.

305
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,034
That way we can ration
what we've got now

306
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,688
and not worry
about it spoiling.

307
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,995
Please tell me this
isn't all there is.

308
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:34,347
We've already planted new crops,
we're setting--

309
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:37,828
Donna, there's barely
a month's worth of food here.

310
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,961
Even with rations,
you're gonna--

311
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,620
Well, people need to
know how bad it is.

312
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,752
All that's gonna do
is make people panic.

313
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,146
Kinda like what's
happening to you now.

314
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,843
You should've told us sooner.

315
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:56,195
And when was I supposed
to do that, Jim?

316
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,980
When you were stuck under
the house that fell on you?

317
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,551
Just trying to do
our best here.

318
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,208
That's all part of it.

319
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,210
Part of what?

320
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,863
It's exactly what
they would want.

321
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,823
They would be trying to
increase the stress level.

322
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,477
Jim.

323
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,132
What do you mean,
we don't have enough food?

324
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:25,659
It's okay, buddy.

325
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,315
Come on,
let's get back to business.

326
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,083
- Are you okay?
- What the--

327
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:43,606
Jesus!

328
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,913
No, no, no, no!
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,610
What the fuck!

330
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,656
I'm so, so--
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:52,311
I'm putting it down. Look.

332
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:55,009
Sorry about that.
I apol--I apologize.

333
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,322
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

334
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,937
No.

335
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,155
Here's the thing.

336
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,331
Any time you say
that we're fine,

337
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,723
it means that we're not fine.

338
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,121
'Kay, what was
I supposed to do?

339
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,731
My dad asked me
not to tell anyone.

340
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,952
Ellis, I'm not "anyone".

341
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,867
We're supposed to
be getting married!

342
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:29,826
We can't just keep
things from each other!

343
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,306
I need to know that--

344
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,314
Look, your dad never should've
put you in that position

345
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,489
to begin with.

346
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,666
Sara murdered people.

347
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,842
And the fact that
he didn't tell anyone--

348
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,322
he didn't tell Kenny!--

349
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:48,628
that's not right.

350
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,325
He didn't have a choice.

351
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:53,023
There's always
a choice.

352
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:56,636
He put people in danger
by bringing her back here!

353
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,942
He made this place
less safe!

354
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,293
And you never should
have kept that from me.

355
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:05,775
I know.

356
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,343
I know.

357
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,476
And I'm sorry.

358
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:17,308
This isn't about
my dad or Sara, is it?

359
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,531
Fatima,
ever since that night

360
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,359
at the Sheriff's
station you've just...

361
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,499
Baby, what's--
what's going on?

362
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:38,025
Hey! I asked you,
what are you fucking doing?

363
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,073
I saw what you were doing!

364
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:44,684
You were sneaking food
out of the pantry.

365
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,947
I wasn't! I was
taking some extra food

366
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,470
outta my backpack
and putting it--

367
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,603
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell's going on?

368
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,256
- They're stealing food!
- What?

369
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,694
Bad enough the storm
wiped out everything we had--

370
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,522
Okay, no, that's not true!
That's not true!

371
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,611
Bullshit.
I saw what you loaded today.

372
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:02,223
First, the magic radio tower
was gonna get everybody home.

373
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:03,746
Does it look
like we're home? No.

374
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,618
No, instead we've got
so many people now

375
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:07,576
we're running out of food,
and they're hiding it

376
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:08,969
- so nobody panics.
- Just stop.

377
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,405
Look, nobody
is hiding anything.

378
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,102
Oh, why don't you
shut the fuck up?

379
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,626
I'm sick and tired of all your
smiley-happy bullshit from you.

380
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:15,758
Okay, whoa, whoa, you better
watch your fucking mouth!

381
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,194
We can't have
new people stealing

382
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,805
what little food we have!

383
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:21,982
They have to go.

384
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,115
- Go on! Get outside.
- Dale.

385
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:26,508
- Go. Get outside!
- Hey, hey!

386
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,554
Look, look, no one
is trying to hurt you--

387
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,164
- Get outside!
- Dale, come on!

388
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:30,947
Get off me!

389
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,775
No!

390
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,431
Oh God, oh fuck,
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,215
Fucking stabbed me.

392
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,130
Get him outta here!

393
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,523
Ellis, I didn't mean to!
I'm sorry!

394
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,267
Hey, can you, um... Here.

395
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,398
Oh my God. Oh my God.

396
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,139
Here, here.

397
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,576
It's okay.
You're okay, you hear me?

398
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:51,664
You're gonna be fine.

399
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,405
Here, let's sit him
right down here.

400
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,929
All right. We got ya.

401
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,585
That's right.
Okay, down.

402
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,980
I'm sorry. Here, let me
just take a quick look.

403
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,288
You're okay.
You're okay.

404
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,463
Hey, can you grab me
some more towels?

405
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:09,943
Yeah, yeah!

406
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:12,467
Pass me--
pass me that thing.

407
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,425
Here, here.
You're okay. You're okay.

408
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,471
Here,
just hold pressure on it.

409
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,690
You're okay.

410
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,301
You're gonna be okay.
You're okay.

411
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:33,401
Some stains
you can't wash clean.

412
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,144
This how we're all
gonna end up?

413
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:41,148
Like Bing-Qian? Like you?

414
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,368
Look, whether you get out
of this place or not, Boyd,

415
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,632
we all end up the same.

416
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,721
I'm not talking about dying.

417
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,158
I'm talking about dying
with your insides on the floor,

418
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:53,987
screaming while some thing
tears you apart.

419
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:58,165
These things inside me,
whatever they are,

420
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:59,514
they're getting worse.

421
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:02,952
So it would seem.

422
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:06,869
I'm proud of you, though.

423
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,089
You know that?

424
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,570
The sheriff I knew

425
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,050
would have never
asked for help,

426
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,661
never admitted weakness.

427
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:21,536
You were the most stubborn
asshole I have ever met.

428
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,540
Things change.

429
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:26,759
Yes, they do.

430
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,024
You know,
those people upstairs...

431
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,898
...they probably all think
you've gone crazy.

432
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,073
Have I?

433
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:38,771
I don't know.

434
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,382
I mean, you're standing
here in this basement

435
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:43,558
talking to a figment
of your imagination.

436
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,911
But, hey,
sometimes crazy

437
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,132
is the most rational
response you could have.

438
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:55,135
The point is,
you did what you could, Boyd.

439
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:57,920
You tried.

440
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,574
Not every story
gets a happy ending.

441
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,663
Mine didn't.
Bing-Qian's didn't.

442
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:03,796
Abby's didn't.

443
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:12,587
You are still the worst
fucking priest I've ever met.

444
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,766
So maybe imagine
a better version next time.

445
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,072
Yeah, right.

446
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,464
Boyd.

447
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,597
Who were you talking to?

448
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,646
Nobody, just thinking
out loud.

449
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:30,257
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Who were you talking to?

450
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,172
Get out of my way.

451
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,611
You're not leaving this room
until I know it's safe.

452
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,831
Excuse me?

453
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:41,094
Look, Marielle told us
what happened upstairs.

454
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,573
All right?
Then I come down here--

455
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,663
Khatri!

456
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,839
I was talking
to Father Khatri.

457
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,670
I know how this looks.
I do!

458
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,629
But something
happened to me out there!

459
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,284
I came back with
something inside my body!

460
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,981
I don't understand
how it's possible!

461
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,462
All I know
is that it's real!

462
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,683
And I'm fucking terrified!

463
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,864
You have to keep
pressure on it, okay?

464
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,169
We're gonna get you
to the clinic.

465
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,736
Donna took the truck.

466
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,173
We'll take the van.
It's parked right by the shed.

467
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,697
No, you can't.
It's too dangerous.

468
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,960
Look, we've got lookouts
at all the windows. It's okay.

469
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,961
I think we're all clear.

470
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:23,571
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

471
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,486
Ellis, there is nothing
we can do for you here.

472
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:26,705
You need to get
to the clinic.

473
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:27,836
Then we can wait
until the morning.

474
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:28,837
No! We're not--

475
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,323
We're not. Hey!
Can you help me out here?

476
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,890
Come on. We're going.

477
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,500
Let's go.

478
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,675
Up, up, up.
We're going.

479
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:41,720
Come on, buddy.

480
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,069
I know, I know, I know.

481
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,331
Come on, buddy.
Hold on.

482
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,941
Okay.

483
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:49,205
That's right. That's right.
Hey! Do you see anything?

484
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,381
Wait! Hold on.
There's one coming up the hill.

485
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:54,167
- Well, how far?
- I don't know. Fifty yards.

486
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,734
- I can't, I can't, I can't.
- No, no--

487
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:57,561
- I can't run. I can't run.
- We have--We have time.

488
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:59,999
You're okay, you're okay.

489
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,743
Meet me at the steps!

490
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,222
What? Wait!

491
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:07,484
Meet me at the steps!

492
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,713
Where you going?

493
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,544
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

494
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,071
Oh, shit.

495
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:32,640
Oh, no. No. Shit.

496
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,062
I know, I know.
Go, go, go, go, go!

497
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,586
I know.

498
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,241
I gotcha. I gotcha.

499
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,554
Here, take
this jacket off.

500
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,342
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

501
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:23,865
Hey, stay!

502
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,610
You're okay. Just breathe.

503
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,264
- I know.
- I can't breathe.

504
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,569
Just keep,
just keep it there.

505
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,180
I can't--

506
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,138
Here! That road!
Get on that road!

507
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,836
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,362
Just keep the pressure on.
Keep the pressure.

509
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,016
You're okay. Look at me.
You're okay.

510
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,061
- Can't breathe.
- You're okay. You're okay.

511
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:48,716
You're okay. You're okay.

512
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,111
- Can you go any faster?
- Yeah.

513
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,984
I know. I know.

514
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,768
Just, here, hold my hand.

515
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,162
You're okay. You're okay.

516
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:01,337
- What happened?
- I don't know.

517
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,643
Can you go any faster?

518
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,516
I know, I know, I know.

519
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,649
Hey, we're almost there!

520
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:09,432
- I know. I know.
- Fatima?

521
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:10,825
What?

522
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,871
You see any of
those things outside?

523
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,525
Uh, uh, no.
I think we're okay.

524
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,876
I think we're okay.

525
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,835
I think we're okay.
I think we're okay.

526
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,054
- I think we're okay.
- Can't breathe.

527
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:24,578
You're okay.
Hi, I'm right here.

528
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,233
We're almost there, guys!
I see it!

529
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,408
Stay with me!

530
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:29,713
- I--
- Kristi's right there.

531
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:31,585
- We're gonna see Kristi.
- Hey, just hold on.

532
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,543
- We're almost there!
- Easy, easy.

533
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,154
All right. You're all right.
Come on.

534
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,766
All right, all right.

535
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,550
You're all right. Come on.
Put your arm around me.

536
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:43,727
Put your arm around me.
I know. I know.

537
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:46,556
Okay, come here.

538
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,602
Help me up.

539
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,387
Slow, slow, slow.
You got it.

540
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,345
Hold my shoulder.

541
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,834
If you want me to leave,
I can go up to Colony House

542
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,575
- for a little bit.
- No.

543
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,447
No, Mari. That's not--

544
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,057
- Kristi! Help!
- Kristi, open the door!

545
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,015
Fuck.

546
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,888
- Kristi!
- Open the door!

547
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:17,065
- Open up!
- Jesus.

548
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:18,371
What happened?

549
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,199
Uh, there was a fight.
Dale had a knife.

550
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,635
Okay.

551
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:23,724
- Bring him inside, okay?
- Yeah.

552
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,552
Boyd! Kenny!
I'm gonna need you up here!

553
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,078
Ellis, you okay?

554
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,123
- Ellis!
- I can't breathe!

555
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,515
Sit him down here!

556
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,430
I can't breathe!

557
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,432
- How long ago did this happen?
- Twenty-five minutes.

558
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,217
Keep pressure!
Keep pressure!

559
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,740
Ellis?

560
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,438
What's--Hey, what happened?
What's--What--

561
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,136
- He was stabbed.
- Kristi, what's happening?

562
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,311
Keep that pillow up!

563
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:46,965
Hey, buddy. Okay, okay.

564
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,444
Keep pressure. Keep pressure
on the wound, okay?

565
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:49,576
- You're okay.
- Can you breathe for me, Ellis?

566
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,143
Okay.

567
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,144
I'm afraid of blood
filling his chest cavity.

568
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,623
Okay, buddy,
that's it.

569
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:54,755
- Look at me. Look at me.
- It's okay, baby.

570
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:55,886
Keep pressure, okay?

571
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,453
- I can't breathe!
- Come on.

572
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,585
Breathe in again.

573
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,108
Kristi, what's happening?

574
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,109
- You're okay.
- Can I do something?

575
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,284
His chest is tensioning.

576
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,329
I need to relieve the pressure.

577
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:04,678
Where do you
keep your saline?

578
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,767
- You can't be in here right now.
- Kristi, come on!

579
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:07,594
I swear to you, I'm fine.

580
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,162
Hey, what is going on?

581
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,599
Top shelf of the supply closet.
Kenny, I need you around here.

582
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:13,643
Buddy? Buddy?

583
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:15,645
Lift up. Pressure.

584
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,299
Okay, just let me
clean the area.

585
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,605
This'll sting.

586
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:19,432
Shit!

587
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,783
Buddy? Hey, buddy.
Hey, you can breathe.

588
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:24,698
You--
Hey, you can breathe.

589
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,352
Just a little poke.

590
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,006
- What's that for?
- I just need to see

591
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:29,790
if it's air or blood
compressing his lungs.

592
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,444
Can you grab this post
for me, please?

593
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:32,793
- Right here, grab it for me?
- All right.

594
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,229
Hey, guys, I'm gonna have
to come in here.

595
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,101
Hey, let's let Kristi
work. Come here. Come.

596
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,363
You're gonna be okay.
'Kay? Trust me.

597
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:38,668
- You're gonna be fine.
- You got it.

598
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,018
There's blood in
his chest cavity.

599
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,845
- We need to move fast!
- Let her work.

600
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,108
It's gonna be okay.
Hey. You're gonna be fine.

601
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,500
Ellis!

602
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:45,545
Give her--
We've gotta give her--

603
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,851
What? What?

604
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,550
I'm gonna need a scalpel
and, um, some rags.

605
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,639
Oh yeah.
Yeah, okay, good.

606
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,684
Gonna make
a little incision, okay?

607
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,730
Here.
Here. Rags.

608
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,905
- Hold this.
- All right.

609
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,428
There's gonna be
a lot of blood, okay?

610
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,389
- Forceps.
- Forceps.

611
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,307
Okay, ready?

612
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:09,612
All right.

613
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:11,440
Okay.

614
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,486
All right, Ellis, we're gonna
relieve the pressure, all right?

615
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:17,968
Ugh.

616
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:27,369
Shit.

617
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,979
Deep breaths Ellis, okay?

618
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,155
Relax your arm
for me if you can.

619
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,852
We're just gonna
let that drain.

620
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:39,251
I can't. I can't.
I can't lose him.

621
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,210
Hey, hey.
Look at me. Look at me.

622
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:43,907
He is not going
anywhere, okay?

623
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:45,561
Look, hey,
do I look nervous?

624
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:46,997
Did Kristi look nervous?

625
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,174
Look, he's fine?
Hey.

626
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,741
Sit down. Sit down.

627
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,178
Hey, just breathe.

628
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:55,876
Breathe.
You're all right. You're okay.

629
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,052
You just--just breathe.

630
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,404
All right?
Hey, you all right?

631
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:05,233
Yeah, um,
I'm not really good with blood.

632
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,930
- Hey.
- Hey, is he okay?

633
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,889
I was able to relieve
the pressure in his chest,

634
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,369
but he's lost a lot of blood.

635
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,110
His heart's
trying to compensate,

636
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,459
but unless we get him
more blood soon,

637
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,069
his organs are
gonna start to fail.

638
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,593
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

639
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,552
- Hey, hey.
- But we aren't there yet, okay?

640
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,075
Boyd, what's his blood type?

641
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,077
O-negative.
We're both O-negative.

642
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,557
Okay. Great.
That's great. Come in.

643
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:26,385
Come on.

644
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,777
Wait, what's going on?

645
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,128
We're gonna use Boyd's blood
to do a transfusion.

646
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,912
I know it sounds scary,
but, trust me, it's a very--

647
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:34,523
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.

648
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,438
You can't.

649
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:40,268
You... You can't
put my blood into him.

650
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,617
- Boyd--
- If you use my blood,

651
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,664
whatever's inside me
is going to go into him!

652
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,753
Boyd, just take a second and
listen to what you're saying--

653
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:48,668
I'm not fucking crazy!

654
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:51,671
These things,
I can feel them.

655
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,500
Even if I can't see them,
I can feel them!

656
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,112
Boyd, if you don't do this,
Ellis is going to die.

657
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,158
Even if what
you're saying is true,

658
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:01,463
it can't be worse than dying.

659
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,639
You tell that to
the guy who did this to me.

660
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,251
We have to find another way.
You can't just--

661
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,906
Boyd, you need
to sit down

662
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,430
and let Kristi do her work.

663
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,736
Hey.
Kenny, please--

664
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,477
Sit down!

665
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,306
If you do this,
you have no idea--

666
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:22,484
Just--God!

667
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:23,572
Oh, my God!

668
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:24,878
Damn it!

669
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:28,142
Oh, my God!
I can see them.

670
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,622
Jesus.

671
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,715
Guys, can somebody
do something!

672
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,499
We need to get him--We need
to get him O-negative blood.

673
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,153
I--
We need to do this now.

674
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,110
Give it to me.

675
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,895
What?

676
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,115
Give it to me.

677
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:47,770
You told Kristi about
the guy in the cave,

678
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:51,296
that he cut you and pressed his
wound against your cut, right?

679
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:55,648
Well, if he gave it to you,
that probably means that

680
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,127
he can pass it
on to someone else.

681
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:02,307
As long as you get
the transfusion done,

682
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,656
we'll figure out
the rest later.

683
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:05,484
No.

684
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:07,877
- Boyd!
- No, no. No!

685
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:10,010
No, there's a nightmare
happening under my skin,

686
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,317
you understand me?

687
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,057
I can feel it
getting stronger.

688
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:18,410
I have no idea what will
happen if I pass it...

689
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:20,977
on to you.

690
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,418
Boyd.

691
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:30,552
Boyd, what
are you doing?

692
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:31,727
- Boyd?
- Boyd!

693
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:33,163
- Boyd!
- I got an idea.

694
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,124
Wait, where are you going?

695
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,043
It has to go somewhere, right?

696
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,743
Boyd!

697
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,049
- Boyd, where--
- Boyd!

698
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,180
What are you doing?

699
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,143
Where you at?

700
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,453
Want some fresh blood?

701
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,065
Fresh meat?

702
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,719
I'm right here.

703
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:10,897
Come get me!

704
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:17,207
I know you're out there.

705
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:20,733
I know you hear me.

706
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,261
You wanna play games?

707
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:32,092
I'm right here!

708
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,269
I'm ready!

709
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,531
Come on!

710
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:41,754
All you fucking do
is knock on our doors,

711
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,843
knock on
our fucking windows!

712
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,846
You wanna play games!

713
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,459
Well, I'm standing
right here!

714
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,678
I fuckin'--

715
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,038
That's right.

716
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:08,346
Come on.

717
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,827
Come get me.

718
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:34,241
That's right.

719
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:45,470
There.

720
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:48,647
What you waiting for?

721
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,997
You want it?

722
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:05,751
My blood is your blood now, motherfucker.

723
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,982
I like this game.

724
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,636
Okay.

725
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,770
It's okay.

726
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,337
We're okay now.

727
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,992
The transfusion,
we need to start.

728
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,445
Just watch it
on that last step.

729
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,143
- Okay.
- You got it.

730
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,495
You can put the bag over
on that chair by the table.

731
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,583
Okay.

732
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:30,330
Well, that wasn't
so bad, huh?

733
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,897
Yeah.

734
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,334
In fact, I'd
venture so far

735
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:36,771
as to say
it was almost fun.

736
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,648
Somethin' interesting
up there?

737
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:47,739
What if this house
falls down, too?

738
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,568
That is not
gonna happen.

739
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,657
How do you know?

740
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:58,445
Because I don't think
your parents

741
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,318
are gonna dig another
giant hole in the floor.

742
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,106
Can I tell you
a secret?

743
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:08,673
Of course you can.

744
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:12,328
I told my mom and dad
I wasn't scared,

745
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:13,634
but I am.

746
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:18,770
I don't wanna be
on a quest anymore.

747
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,380
I wanna go home.

748
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,861
Okay.

749
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:27,517
Can I tell you
a secret?

750
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,310
I'm a little
scared, too.

751
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:40,226
Really?

752
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:41,096
Yup.

753
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,055
But guess what?

754
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:44,404
What?

755
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,580
That's a good thing.

756
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:47,886
Why?

757
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:53,935
My mom told me something
when I was about your age,

758
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:56,938
and I think it might
have been the smartest thing

759
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,897
anyone ever told me.

760
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:01,203
You wanna hear it?

761
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:03,118
Yeah.

762
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:05,773
She said that fear

763
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:08,776
is something
that lives inside us.

764
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:13,389
Just like hope
or joy or love.

765
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,741
They're all things
that make us special.

766
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:22,572
But fear might be
the most important one of all.

767
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,096
Why?

768
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:28,143
Because without fear,

769
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:31,190
we wouldn't know
how to be brave.

770
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:36,935
Fear is what
makes us heroes.

771
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,071
Aw.

772
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,596
Hey, kiddo.

773
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:50,992
You, sir, are done.

774
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,515
All right. Okay.

775
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,256
Uh-uh. You should
lie down for a little bit.

776
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:56,128
I'm okay.

777
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:59,174
Kr--Kristi.

778
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:02,351
I am okay.
All right?

779
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:03,483
You get it.

780
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,662
Hey, Ellis.

781
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:09,750
- Mm.
- Hey.

782
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,667
How you doing?

783
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:14,755
How's your breathing?

784
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,672
Oh, I can breathe.

785
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:19,804
Good.

786
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,502
Good.

787
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:27,072
I'm, uh,
I'm gonna get some new sheets.

788
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,508
Clean you up, okay?

789
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:30,075
Thank you.

790
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,300
Hey.

791
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,519
Hi.

792
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,001
You still mad at me?

793
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,524
Shut up.

794
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:49,834
Sorry.

795
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:50,835
No.

796
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:54,055
You get some rest.

797
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:55,491
Where you going?

798
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,755
I'll be right back.

799
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,639
Hey.

800
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,341
You okay?

801
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:26,131
I almost lost him.

802
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,568
But you didn't, okay?

803
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:29,743
You didn't.

804
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:36,054
Those things
under Boyd's skin--

805
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:39,231
the--the--
I mean, this fucking place.

806
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:41,233
How is that--

807
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:42,234
I know.

808
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,670
I can't...

809
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:49,676
Hey.

810
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:55,595
I need to
ask you something.

811
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,946
And I need you to promise me
that you won't tell anyone.

812
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:00,687
Yeah. Of course.

813
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,562
Do you have
any pregnancy tests?

814
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,794
We should've listened to you.

815
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,275
We should have trusted you.

816
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:27,975
It all worked out.

817
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,847
That's all that matters.

818
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:35,809
Has it moved?

819
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:38,638
Nope.

820
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:41,728
Is it... dead?

821
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,948
Well, we'll find out
soon enough.
