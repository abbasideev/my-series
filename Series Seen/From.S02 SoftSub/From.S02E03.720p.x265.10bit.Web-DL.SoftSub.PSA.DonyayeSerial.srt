I'm sorry.

181
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,584
- I thought...
- I know. I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:31,688
I'm so sorry.

183
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,535
I can't lose you.

184
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,034
No, no, no.

185
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,583
[sighs]

186
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,365
Jim...

187
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,408
the wires aren't
connected to anything.

188
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,008
What?

189
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,718
Yeah, they were just
dangling from the ceiling.

190
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,990
How'd there be any electricity

191
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,424
if the wires aren't connected?

192
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,729
Tabitha, we have so
much to talk about.

193
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,055
How are the kids holding up?

194
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,389
I don't know.

195
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:13,104
I think I'm gonna
take them to the diner

196
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:16,449
to see if I can get some food.
I don't know when they've eaten.

197
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,831
I love you.

198
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,756
I love you too.

199
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,425
You are not listening to me.

200
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,970
No, I'm listening, and I'm
telling you to fuck off.

201
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,462
You think after what
happened last night

202
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,709
I'm just gonna trust you people?

203
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,374
That is not gonna
do any good against

204
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,771
those things that
come out at night!

205
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,266
All you're gonna do is
make everyone here nervous.

206
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,180
No, but it's okay for you to
start shooting out fuckin' tires

207
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,042
though, right? Because that
made people real fuckin' calm!

208
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,177
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You are a f...

209
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey, Donna.

210
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,112
What's... What's goin' on
here? What's goin' on, Donna?

211
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:50,532
Who the fuck are you?

212
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,480
Boyd Stevens.

213
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,510
I'm the sheriff.

214
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,095
I thought the Asian
guy was the sheriff.

215
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,840
We're just having a little
disagreement about firearms.

216
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,852
Residents don't carry guns.

217
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:03,877
That's the rule.

218
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,092
And whose rule is that?

219
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:06,157
Mine.

220
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:10,253
Well, uh, rules change.

221
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,220
No, no, no.

222
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:13,745
Got it, hold, hold up.

223
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:16,197
Look. I understand.

224
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,680
I understand this is
all pretty scary, right?

225
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,725
But I've had a
strange fuckin' week,

226
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,084
so I'm a little less
patient than normal.

227
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,515
You don't like
the rules. Great.

228
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,063
You take your rifle, you
go live out in the woods,

229
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,008
and make whatever
rules you like.

230
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,251
See how long you last.

231
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,977
Now, now.

232
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,630
You want a roof over your head
at night when those things

233
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,964
come out to hunt, then you
put the fucking rifle down

234
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,692
and you listen to the lady.

235
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,456
[scoffs]

236
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:51,954
That's a good choice.

237
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,039
Mm.

238
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,422
Mm-hm.

[Boyd] Listen.

240

We're all... gonna have

241
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,600
the time to talk, okay?
Answer all your questions.

242
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,905
- Just know...
- [quietly] Asshole.

243
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,734
That we are all in
this thing together,

244
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,737
and the only way to get
through this is together.

245
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,423
Take 'em to the house.

246
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,559
Go. Go.

247
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:29,753
[indistinct chattering]

248
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,730
Do you want more?

249
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,971
- No, that's good.
- Okay, come on.

250
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,663
Okey-dokey. Here.

251
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,552
Honey, you need
to eat something.

252
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:58,798
I'm not hungry.

253
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,234
Have this, Jules.

254
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,719
Really good.

255
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,009
Can we go see Victor?

256
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,880
Mom?

257
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:11,005
Yeah?

258
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,580
Can we go see Victor?

259
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,172
No, honey, not now.

260
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:17,191
He's been through
a rough few days.

261
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,880
I hope he's not mad at me.

262
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:21,975
Why would he be mad at you?

263
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,890
Me and Jade were in his room.

264
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:27,954
He said he was looking for
clues about how to get home.

265
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,244
I told him Victor
wouldn't like it.

266
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:37,777
Are we gonna be able
to get our stuff back?

267
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,369
Norman's down there.

268
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,014
[Tabitha] I don't know, honey.

269
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,752
Eat your food, okay?

270
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:47,621
Where are you going?

271
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,521
I'll be right back.
[clears throat]

272
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,687
Can I... Can I talk
to you for a second?

273
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:55,802
Yeah.

274
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,695
You like tea?

275
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Oh, no, no.

276
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,375
Thank you. I'm okay.

277
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,684
Um...

278
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,280
I know you oversee a lot
of the supplies in town,

279
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:22,077
and I was wondering if maybe I
could go through the storage?

280
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,034
Everything we had
was in that house.

281
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,354
We don't have any
supplies or clothing or...

282
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:35,803
You come stay our house.

283
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,828
Okay?

284
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:41,189
Mothers help together.

285
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,580
Thank you.

286
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,105
Thank you so much.

287
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,778
Ya hear about Kristi's fiancée?

288
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:51,215
I did.

289
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,725
Not sure that's ever
happened before.

290
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,464
So, uh, you know, what
are supplies looking like?

291
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,414
Not good.

292
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,380
Storm wiped out half our crop.

293
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,385
We're gonna have to get
real serious about rations

294
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,027
with all of the new people.

295
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,305
Driver said there
were 25 aboard.

296
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,501
What with the folks in the diner

297
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,091
and the bodies we
found this morning,

298
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,826
we're accounting for about 22.

299
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,403
Busload of terrified people,
and I fire a fuckin' shotgun.

300
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,769
You were gonna lose
people no matter what,

301
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:35,345
so let's... focus on
the ones you saved.

302
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:41,308
You gonna tell me what
happened out there?

303
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,149
Hey, I got another one.

304
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:58,969
Okay.

Shit.

308
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,055
Can we salvage that one?

309
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,044
No, there's, um...
I can't find the...

310
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,334
Can you stop with the flowers,
please, and just help?

get that you're probably

the whole Kristi thing.

There's this symbol
that I keep seeing.

I mean, I keep seeing things
that aren't actually there,

but every time I do,
there's this symbol,

380

and there's this book
that Kenny's mom gave me.

381
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,055

symbol and there's a picture.

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,302
Like a... a lake or a pond?

540
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:59,862
Uh, yeah, I mean, we
have this place called

541
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,894
the Brundles not far from here.

542
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,372
Can I see it?

543
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,845
Here it is.

544
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,882
Closest thing to normal
fun we have here.

545
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,921
Why do they call
it the Brundles?

546
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:17,584
Uh, it was just called
that when I got here.

547
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:19,781
How did you know about...

548
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,169
I saw it.

549
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:26,257
Were you the one on the
bus that had the dream?

550
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,075
Yeah, those happen sometimes.

551
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,647
People have all sorts of
strange reactions to this place.

552
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,085
Dreams, nightmares,
weird premonitions.

553
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,955
But we don't know
why or what it means.

554
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,390
Why it happens to some
people and not to others.

555
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,095
This one girl, Nadia, she
used to say that it was

556
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,326
like this place was
calling out to us,

557
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:56,450
but only some of us were
listening closely enough

558
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:57,475
to hear it.

559
00:29:58,225 --> 00:29:59,665
But has anyone...

560
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,890
Yes.

561
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,675
People have obsessed
over these things.

562
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,630
They've compared
and picked it apart.

563
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:10,372
It didn't tell us anything
we didn't already know.

564
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:12,265
Which is what?

565
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:16,397
That we're stuck.

566
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:19,550
And nobody can tell us why.

567
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,188
So?

568
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:29,114
Well, I mean, even if
we were in a hospital,

569
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:32,289
this would be at least
a 15-hour operation.

570
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,665
But she's talking.

571
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,094
I mean, she's literally
sitting there and talking.

572
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,658
Yeah, I know.

573
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:43,614
But, uh, how long
can she be here?

574
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,630
Uh, I mean, it could be
hours. It could be days.

575
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:50,049
I... She's not
suffering right now,

576
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:51,817
but I don't know how
long that's gonna last.

577
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:53,196
Those things, they'll
be back tonight.

578
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,654
Okay, so then we have
to get her out of here.

579
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:56,155
Look, I don't think
you understand.

580
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,890
I mean, it's a miracle
she's even still alive.

581
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,639
So then, what do we do?

582
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,070
How do we, um...

583
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,880
How do we do it?

584
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:16,952
Do you have something in
your bag that might...

585
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:18,917
No, nothing that would
be strong enough.

586
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
[exhales]

587
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:25,055
We have to pull out the rod.

588
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,100
[gasps]

589
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,630
Okay. Will it, uh...

590
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,630
Will it be peaceful?

591
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:34,212
I don't know.

592
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,634
Look, there's...

593
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,555
there is one more option.

594
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,550
No. No.

595
00:31:44,055 --> 00:31:47,955
I'm not having her last moments
be with a gun to her head, okay?

596
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,560
Kristi?

597
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:52,909
Hey.

598
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,050
I'm right here.

599
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,820
I'm not okay, am I?

600
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:02,048
[exhales]

601
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:03,073
No.

602
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:07,231
No, you're not.

603
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,289
Am I gonna die?

604
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,896
Yeah.

605
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:35,125
These are for Dad.

606
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,305
Mom, this has a huge hole in it.

607
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,740
- So? If it fits, it goes.
- [scoffs]

608
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,378
Oh, just like
this one. Perfect.

609
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,559
So how come Ethan gets
to spend the afternoon

610
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:52,218
looking through
toys with Mrs. Liu

611
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:53,855
and I get stuck doing this?

612
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,392
Oh, honey, I'm sorry, do
you want to play with toys?

613
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,325
Come on, Julie.

614
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,151
This is what being
an adult looks like.

615
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:01,626
[scoffs]

616
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,839
Hm.

617
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:05,669
Oh.

618
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,905
Look at this.

619
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,240
Try this on.

620
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:14,685
This is so creepy.

621
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,565
All this stuff has belonged
to people who've...

622
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,690
What?

623
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,183
It's no different
than a thrift store.

624
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:23,310
It's a little different.

625
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,350
It fits you. Perfect.

626
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,530
So are we living with
Kenny and his mom now?

627
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:29,315
And Jade?

628
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,180
[exhales] Well, just for now.

629
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:33,288
You know, once your
dad's back on his feet,

630
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,054
then we can start look...

631
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:37,814
[breathing unsteadily]

632
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:39,765
Mom?

633
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,127
Mom, what's wrong?

634
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,756
What's wrong?

635
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,285
Nothing.

636
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,380
Mom, what happened just now?

637
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,075
- What's going on?
- Wait.

638
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,340
I don't know. Nothing.
Let's go home.

639
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,094
- What?
- Let's go home.

640
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,621
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

641
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,485
Hey, babe.

642
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:10,039
I'm back a little
sooner than expected.

643
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,069
That big swing we talked about?

644
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,897
It didn't go quite
the way I'd planned.

645
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,395
But I got some news. Uh...

646
00:34:24,086 --> 00:34:25,941
Somebody's getting married.

647
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,979
Maybe you already knew that.

648
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,387
Or maybe...

649
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:45,847
Maybe none of this is real.

650
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:51,804
Maybe you and Ellis are
sittin' by a hospital bed

651
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:55,830
waiting for me to
open my eyes up.

652
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:58,445
Just open your eyes up! Op...

653
00:34:58,645 --> 00:35:00,575
I mean, how could a...

654
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,710
How could a man that's
chained to a wall in a place

655
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,805
that's not there know your name?

656
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,980
How can that be real?

657
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,188
That... How can...

658
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,250
Mom, what happened back there?

659
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,820
[exhales] Nothing. I'm fine.

660
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:23,645
Mom.

661
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,100
What?! I'm fine.

662
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,036
You know, why don't you
take these upstairs, please.

663
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,470
Mom, talk to me!

664
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:34,556
Do you know what I
spent the whole night

665
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,820
thinking about in that diner?

666
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:39,790
How I was gonna have to take
care of Ethan by myself,

667
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:41,835
'cause I thought you were dead.

668
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,900
And I sat there waiting for
those things to find Dad

669
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,645
and rip him apart.

670
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,654
So don't tell me you're fine,
and don't tell me it's nothing.

671
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,457
Yes, I saw something.

672
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,562
Something that wasn't there.

673
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:02,967
[exhales] It's not the
first time that's happened.

674
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:06,137
What do you mean?

675
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:14,543
After Thomas died,

676
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:18,611
for months I could
still hear him crying.

677
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,969
Sometimes I would
even go into a room,

678
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,069
and I would see him there.

679
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:32,329
Just for a second. It
always felt so peaceful.

680
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,194
Like he was letting
me know he was okay.

681
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,780
So that's what
happened just now?

682
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:43,460
You saw Thomas?

683
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:46,165
No. No, no.

684
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,608
No, this... this was different.

685
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:54,605
I saw two children

686
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,806
standing in the middle of
the road staring at me.

687
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:00,615
But this...

688
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:01,907
What?

689
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:08,474
It didn't feel peaceful.

690
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,617
Is Ellis still there?

691
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:18,962
Hi.

692
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:22,479
Yeah, I'm still here.

693
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:26,940
And, um, who's the other boy?

694
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,712
Oh, that's, uh...
that's Kenny.

695
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:31,667
He's our deputy.

696
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,066
Hi, Kenny.

697
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:35,666
Hi.

698
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:39,342
You're all so nice.

699
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,965
Um, can you get
my phone, please?

700
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,696
I have to call my mom.
I have to tell her...

701
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,728
Um, yeah, the, uh,
the phones here,

702
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:51,084
they... they don't really work.

703
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:54,225
But, uh, we can... we
can write you a note.

704
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,845
I've got some
paper in-in my bag.

705
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,048
You, uh... you just tell
us what you wanna say,

706
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:01,774
and we'll write it
down for you, okay?

707
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,358
You'll make sure she gets it?

708
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,470
Yeah.

709
00:38:08,063 --> 00:38:09,887
I guess that'd be okay.

710
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,150
Whenever you're ready.

711
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,870
Um, tell her, um...

712
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,345
Tell her that I love her.

713
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,210
And I'm sorry I
didn't give her a hug.

714
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,814
Um, she wanted one, but I
was mad when I left so...

715
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,239
[laughs] It was so stupid.

716
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,816
We had this fight
