00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,359
<i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:12,490
I hear their voices.

3
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,492
They said it was
the only way to go home!

4
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,407
Sara, just tell me
what you did.

5
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,496
I left the door open.

6
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,765
I saw something
that wasn't there.

7
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,420
- What?
- I saw two children

8
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:32,206
standing in the middle
of the road, staring at me.

9
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,512
<i>Is this Jim?</i>

10
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,645
I am not saying
ignore it.

11
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:40,083
You already got people's hopes
up with your goddamn tower.

12
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,171
All the more
reason that we--

13
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,347
To keep our fucking
mouths shut.

14
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,870
What's
about to happen,

15
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,090
it's gonna
save everyone.

16
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,700
Where's my mom?
I want my mom!

17
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,180
Ethan, run!

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,271
Nathan, please!

19
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:55,794
I spent the entire night
with her,

20
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:58,884
and that scalpel she used,
she took it from my clinic.

21
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,277
This is not your fault.

22
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,105
How exactly
are you gonna tell Kenny

23
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,367
that Sara killed his dad?

24
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,587
I did what I had to do!
She was valuable!

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,589
She-- she may
still be valuable!

26
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,157
They tore him to pieces,
and you knew!

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,245
Kenny, please.

28
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,290
You watch your
own fucking six.

29
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:17,555
There's a symbol
that I keep seeing.

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,600
Look at this.

31
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,081
Look. This guy...

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,214
he must have been
seeing it, too.

33
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,737
That's you, right?

34
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,176
This could be the key to
getting the hell out of here.

35
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,091
Stay away from me!

36
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,615
Welcome to
your new home.

37
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:34,616
Hop on up.

38
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,229
Every night,
those things come.

39
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,580
There really
is no way out.

40
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,568
Hi. Are you
comfortable in there?

41
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,137
You think this is scary?

42
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,400
Huh?

43
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,447
Hiya.

44
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,188
You think
this is scary?

45
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,192
What am I
supposed to be?

46
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:34,154
Huh? Am I supposed to
be pissing myself? Huh?

47
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,374
Heh. Well, you
can't get in here,

48
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,160
'cause there's a fucking rock
in the fucking window!

49
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,338
Yeah. Yeah, that's real
fucking scary.

50
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,340
I'm not afraid
of you.

51
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:48,951
You understand me?

52
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,521
See ya.

53
00:02:58,743 --> 00:02:59,701
Where you goin'?

54
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,966
Where you goin'?
Hey!

55
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,315
Huh? Hey!

56
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,708
Huh?

57
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,536
I'm fucking talking to you.

58
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,451
Don't fucking
walk away from me.

59
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,373
You don't fucking walk
away from me!

60
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,261
Oh, God. That motherfucking...

Hey! You get
back downstairs.

87
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:45,927
Stay out of sight.

88
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,971
I'll handle this.

89
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,757
Go!

90
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,415
Coming.

91
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:57,895
- Where is she?
- Hey, hey, look.

92
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,810
Hey, hey, can
we just calm down?

93
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,509
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

94
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,075
Are you fucking
serious?

95
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:07,078
There's a lot about this
that you don't understand.

96
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,124
Really? What?

97
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,647
That she hears voices?

98
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,693
That she's important?

99
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,564
Kenny told us.
She's a fucking murderer.

100
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,697
That's what she is.
How could you do this?

101
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,916
She is not going to
hurt anyone!

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,918
I don't give a shit what
she's gonna do!

103
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,572
All I care about is what
she's done.

104
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,226
She tried to kill
my fucking kid!

105
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,576
Yes, I know. I know. I know.
I know. I know. I know. I know.

106
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,099
Alright.
So, now what?

107
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,972
We just supposed to pretend
like nothing happened?

108
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,147
What about your rules?

109
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,496
Things have changed.

110
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,281
- How?
- How? Someone put a tower,

111
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,501
a fucking tower,
on Colony House

112
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,111
and told everyone
they were going home!

113
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,070
Now, they're all looking
at me, wondering why

114
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,768
I didn't come back with
all the answers!

115
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,944
We got a busload of people
we don't have resources for,

116
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:50,774
and a fucking house fell
for no goddamn reason!

117
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:55,039
So, yeah, if she can help us
figure out what's going on here,

118
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,826
she stays out
of the Box! Period!

119
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,570
- Hey!
- Eh! I told you

120
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,136
to stay
downstairs! Look.

121
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,703
I wanna talk to you.

122
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,010
You need to listen
very fucking carefully.

123
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,754
If you ever come
near my family again,

124
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:17,497
I swear to God I will
fucking kill you!

125
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:21,326
Say you understand.

126
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,806
Say you understand!

127
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,636
I do.

128
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,945
Listen. You
have my word--

129
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,903
I don't give a shit
about your word!

130
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,255
Jim, listen.

131
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,303
Don't even.

132
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,307
Fuck!

133
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,136
Goddamn it!

134
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,574
Okay.

135
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:58,015
You lock the door.
You stay inside.

136
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,190
Where are you going?

137
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,627
Colony House.

138
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,019
Gotta talk to Donna.

139
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,892
I want to make sure she
hears this from my mouth.

140
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:05,936
Boyd!

141
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:10,854
I shouldn't be here! I...

142
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,642
I'm not strong
enough for this.

143
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,034
That part I can't
help you with,

144
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,080
so you better figure
it out!

145
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,979
Ethan.

146
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,723
Ethan, I promise if
you let me in,

147
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,682
it's just me, okay?

148
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,118
There's nobody else
out here.

149
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,948
Ethan, come on.
Please let me in.

150
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,993
Julie, what's
going on?

151
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:09,347
He heard us last night
talking about Sara.

152
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,740
Now, he won't
come out.

153
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,834
Ethan?

154
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,662
Honey, I promise no
one's going to hurt you.

155
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:22,709
Yeah. Your mom and I,
we're never gonna let anybody

156
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:23,884
hurt you.

157
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,980
It's like, uh, with
the Cromenockle?

158
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:35,896
When she's afraid to
go inside of the cave.

159
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,911
I wanna see her.

160
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,740
I wanna see Sara.

161
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,223
Okay. So, hi.

162
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,964
They're not exactly

163
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,793
chocolate chip, but they're
the best I could do.

164
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:05,926
Mm.

165
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,319
Here. Careful.
It's hot.

166
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:09,756
Thank you.

167
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,149
Alright. Ready?

168
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,460
What are they?

169
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:21,506
Okay. So, they're these bread
crisps that Tian-Chen makes.

170
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,162
They're, like, a cross
between a cracker and a chip.

171
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,208
They're actually
really good. Okay?

172
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:37,044
Huh.

173
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,351
Right? Okay. Don't get
crumbs in the bed.

174
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,702
Thanks.

175
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,797
I have a surprise
for you.

176
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,450
What?

177
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:55,715
Um... okay.

178
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:01,938
Close your eyes.

179
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,082
Open them.

180
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,741
Shut up.

181
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:27,224
How-- how-- how
do even you have this?

182
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,879
Are you kidding? I haven't
gone anywhere without it

183
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,228
since you...

184
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:33,796
For a long time,

185
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,538
it still smelled
like you.

186
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,105
Now, it just smells.

187
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:46,156
I still remember the last time
I saw you wearing it.

188
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,295
Hey.

189
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,080
Hmm?

190
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,430
Where'd you go?

191
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,954
Nowhere.

192
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:04,784
Kristi, what's wrong?

193
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,830
Nothing.

194
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,005
It's stupid.

195
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,312
Okay.

196
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:13,923
Tell me anyway.

197
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,887
What if I'm not
the same anymore?

198
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:26,501
I've just...
...seen things here.

199
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,242
I've had to
do things that--

200
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,199
Hey.

201
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,900
You're still you.

202
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,163
I'm still me.

203
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:40,254
The rest of it,

204
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:42,082
we'll figure it
out together.

205
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,085
Hmm?

206
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,223
Every ounce, every
inch, remember?

207
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,082
What are you doing?

208
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,127
Sorry. I, uh--

209
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,302
That's my coat.

210
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,566
- No, this is--
- What's going on?

211
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,177
That girl's here,

212
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,569
the one who killed
her brother.

213
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,441
Please, I just...

214
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,445
- Get the fuck out.
- I don't want any trouble.

215
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:27,143
You can't have your house back.
Look. She has my coat.

216
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,753
This is my
brother's jacket.

217
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,103
Not anymore it's not.

218
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,582
Put it down and
get the fuck out.

219
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,715
I just
want our things.

220
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,587
There's something
special that I...

221
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,981
The rest of your stuff
is gone. We packed it up.

222
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,157
We-- we gave it to
Kenny's mom for storage.

223
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,467
There was this small ceramic
ornament about this big.

224
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,424
Do you remember?

225
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,078
He just fucking
told you no!

226
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,255
Look. It was creepy
having your stuff here,

227
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,431
and it's really creepy
that you're here right now,

228
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:58,174
so please just put
the coat down and go away.

229
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,221
- Please.
- Get the fuck out.

230
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,455
Yeah. Okay.

231
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,111
Yeah.

232
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,419
Ah.

233
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,031
Excuse me, bud.

234
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,259
You don't look good.

235
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,609
Tom's dead.

236
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,003
Bar's closed.

237
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,310
- What are you doing?
- Oh, what do you care?

238
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,487
I'm trying to figure
out the symbol

239
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:53,360
that you refuse to
help me with,

240
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,362
despite the fact that you
clearly know something

241
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,147
- you're not telling me.
- Well, I'll tell you what I can.

242
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,324
- Really?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,761
First, you have to
do something for me.

244
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,502
Oh.

245
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,244
So, now you need something
from me, you're--

246
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:10,377
You know what?
First of all, fuck off,

247
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,032
and second
of all, fuck off!

248
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,427
Okay.

249
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,041
Wait!

250
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,872
What do you want?

251
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,178
Mm.

252
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,314
I want you to play.

253
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,711
The fuck is
wrong with you?

254
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:44,585
If you play, I'll tell you
about the man in the photo.

255
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:50,460
You tell me about the photo
first. Then I play.

256
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,420
Mm, no.

257
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,684
Just give me
the fuckin' violin.

258
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:57,685
Not here.

259
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,079
Come.

260
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,342
The fuck?

261
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,259
- Come with me!
- Okay! Alright!

262
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,653
This took me all
fucking night.

263
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,747
There's no way I'm letting
him anywhere near that--

264
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,445
Tabby.

265
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:21,100
How can you even
consider this, Jim?

266
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,102
After Thomas...

267
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,672
Because the doctors
all said

268
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,762
that we should let him
lead sometimes,

269
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,590
and they also said
that we have to let him

270
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,766
work through things
in his own way

271
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,769
and to be there to
support him when he asks.

272
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:41,337
Anyways, I'll be there,
right there with him.

273
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,343
- I'm coming with you.
- Tabby.

274
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:50,390
Look. I don't give a shit
what the doctors said.

275
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,174
We're living in
a fucking nightmare,

276
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,610
and that bitch tried
to kill my kid.

277
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,527
Please let me
do this.

278
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:01,618
Mom?

279
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,838
Hey... Hey.

280
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:07,363
I remember what
you told me yesterday

281
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,932
about this place,
how scary it is.

282
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,194
Mm-hmm.

283
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,283
When you're on
a quest,

284
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:17,286
we have to face
the scary things.

285
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,332
That's how you take
their power away.

286
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,338
Yeah.

287
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,392
Stay with
Daddy, okay?

288
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,525
And do exactly
what he tells you.

289
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:41,571
- Okay.
- Okay.

290
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,883
What were you
fucking doing, Boyd?

291
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,975
By the rules of
this town,

292
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,020
the rules
<i>you</i> created,

293
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,631
that girl should
have gone in the Box

294
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:58,893
the second
you found her.

295
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,851
Listen. Father Khatri--

296
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,026
Khatri's fucking dead.

297
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,767
Don't you
lay this on him.

298
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,683
You made your
own call here, Boyd.

299
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:09,686
You told people you
were coming back with answers,

300
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,993
and instead, you came back
with a psychopath

301
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,430
who killed not one
but four people.

302
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,519
And because she's special,
she doesn't have to go

303
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,392
in the Box? Do you
hear what that sounds like?

304
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,697
She knew things!

305
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,351
Out in the forest,
she knew things

306
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,353
she couldn't
possibly have known!

307
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,442
Okay. Great.

308
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,357
- So what?
- What do you mean, "So what?"

309
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,881
I mean, we're still
fuckin' here.

310
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,535
Voices or no voices,

311
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,017
do you see a yellow brick
fuckin' road leading us home?

312
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,497
Because I sure don't.

313
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,587
I just see someone who may
have just betrayed

314
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,285
the one thing this place
still has going for it.

315
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,678
And what's that?

316
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:48,464
Faith. In you.

317
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,556
- You want the truth?
- I mean...

318
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,257
I don't think this has anything
to do with going home.

319
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,521
I think this
is about Abby.

320
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,612
I think you
shot your wife,

321
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,396
and every
morning since,

322
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,486
you wake up wishing
you'd done more,

323
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,923
that you'd
been there for her,

324
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,317
helped her,

325
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,492
fixed her.

326
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:20,409
But Abby's dead, Boyd.

327
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,543
And Sara's a killer.

328
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,637
You gonna have my
back on this or not?

329
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,771
Okay.

330
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,426
What do
you want, Boyd?

331
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,124
You want my approval?
Y-You want absolution?

332
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,604
'Cause you're
not gonna get it here.

333
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,563
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

334
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,522
What did
Tian-Chen say?

335
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,482
How does she feel
about Sara being back?

336
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,833
- I haven't--
- Yeah. Well, maybe you should.

337
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,422
Sara?

338
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:24,691
He has something
he wants to say to you.

339
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,711
Everyone thought
you died.

340
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:47,453
But you didn't.

341
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:49,890
You lived.

342
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:52,893
Out in the woods.

343
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,377
Only monsters
live in the woods.

344
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,425
I thought
we were friends.

345
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,385
But we're not.

346
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,909
You're a monster.

347
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,654
And I'm not
afraid of you.

348
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:19,789
Okay.

349
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,742
- Where are we going?
- It's just a little further.

350
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,918
Listen. You want me to play
something for you, I'll play,

351
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,181
but I'm not gonna wander around
with you all day while you--

352
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:05,487
It's strange.

353
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,795
The trees,
they're changing.

354
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:11,885
The fuck does
that mean?

355
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,640
Oh. Well,
this is, uh...

356
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,481
Did you do all this?

357
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:44,613
After everyone...

358
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,268
Once I was alone,

359
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,618
I-- I didn't want to look
at the cars anymore,

360
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:53,753
so I put them where I
couldn't see them.

361
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,626
There's more
past the rocks,

362
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,801
a lot more,

363
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:00,673
but those
were already here.

364
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:03,719
Come on.

365
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:08,550
I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

366
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,552
I don't like when
people touch my things,

367
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,772
and when I
heard you play...

368
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:17,994
Uh, sometimes,
I get angry,

369
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,039
and I'm sorry.

370
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,696
Okay.

371
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,530
Here.

372
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:35,316
- Here what?
- This is where you play.

373
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,883
Oh, thank God. Here.

374
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,757
What do you, uh--
What do you wanna hear?

375
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,195
Play the one
about the star.

376
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,545
The what?

377
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,070
Twinkling star.

378
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,122
This was
your mother's car.

379
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:08,697
She used to play
it when I was afraid.

380
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:13,136
And I'd sit up here,
just like this,

381
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,747
and she'd play.

382
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:17,619
At night,
when we hid,

383
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,055
when I heard
the people screaming,

384
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:22,842
she'd tell me to think
about the twinkling stars.

385
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:28,587
And then... I wouldn't
be afraid anymore.

386
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,111
Do you
know that song?

387
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,596
Yeah. Uh... I know it.

388
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,159
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

389
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,204
I didn't mean to...

390
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,866
I didn't think
anyone would be here.

391
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,216
It's okay.

392
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,828
Plenty of room.

393
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,719
Were you on the bus?

394
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:43,156
Yeah.

395
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:46,986
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,259
Have you been
here long?

397
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,348
A couple months.

398
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,744
Feels like
much longer.

399
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,444
Do you live
here in town?

400
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:14,535
I mean, obviously,
you-- you live in town.

401
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,928
I just...

402
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:20,889
I hadn't seen you
up at the Colony House.

403
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,892
I would've
noticed you.

404
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,766
I, um...

405
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,118
I guess right now,
I live here.

406
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:35,817
I figured a priest
would live here

407
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,253
or something.

408
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:38,385
There used to be.

409
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:41,997
Oh.

410
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,526
I go every Sunday with
my grandma.

411
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,920
Uh, to church,
I mean.

412
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,836
As long as
I can remember.

413
00:29:57,317 --> 00:30:00,146
Is that where you were going
when you were on the bus?

414
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,278
To see
your grandmother?

415
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:06,239
Yeah. She... uh...

416
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,071
I go see her
every weekend.

417
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,248
I was never
all that religious,

418
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:19,295
but... it always made
her happy,

419
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,471
you know, me going to
church with her,

420
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:25,171
and afterwards, we'd spend
the afternoon sitting outside,

421
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,435
making these little
crochet owls.

422
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:30,829
Really?

423
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:36,051
It was always
an owl.

424
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,445
And she has
hundreds of 'em.

425
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,926
Uh, she would give them
to every person that she met.

426
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,537
And I-- I
would tell her,

427
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,194
"Grandma, maybe we could try to
switch it up a little bit.

428
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:51,850
Maybe try a dog or
a bunny or something."

429
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:54,591
But she'd tell me,

430
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,507
"Elgin, I like
what I like,

431
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,379
and I like owls."

432
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,338
So we made owls.

433
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:08,431
You must think
I'm really cool.

434
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,265
I was kind of a dork
when I was a kid.

435
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,225
My brother and I,

436
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:24,012
we used to collect these little
ceramic Christmas ornaments

437
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,405
from the dollar store
in town.

438
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,190
We'd save up
all our money.

439
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:31,106
We'd go every chance we got,
like, all year round.

440
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,021
We wouldn't even wait
for Christmas.

441
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:37,112
And then we'd get home,
and we would paint them

442
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,115
with all
these crazy colors.

443
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,031
We had so many at
one point,

444
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,120
we could've decorated
a hundred trees

445
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,296
and still had
some left over.

446
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,256
Nathan's always looked
a lot better than mine.

447
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,130
I thought
they were all gone.

448
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:58,394
Turns out...

449
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,010
Nathan kept one with him
all these years.

450
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:09,971
He said it reminded him of
a time when things were...

451
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,107
Is he here now?

452
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,283
Your brother?

453
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,330
He was.

454
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:32,167
What happened
to the ornament?

455
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:36,737
It's here...
somewhere. I just...

456
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,784
I think the person who has
it won't wanna give it back.

457
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,308
Hey.

458
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:45,485
You need some muscle,
I'm happy to talk to 'em.

459
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,098
You're sweet.

460
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:55,277
How come you don't stay up
at the Colony House?

461
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:58,411
I mean, the people up there seem
friendly, for the most part.

462
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:03,416
No reason to be hanging
around an old, musty church.

463
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,290
It always seemed like
such a nice idea...

464
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,121
that no matter what
you did...

465
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,516
if you
were truly sorry...

466
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:19,519
then God would
forgive you.

467
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,044
Do you
think that's true?

468
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,352
That part
always seemed

469
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,616
a bit like wishful
thinking to me.

470
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,404
Why? Did you do something
that needs forgiving?

471
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,280
I killed my brother.

472
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,635
But it was
an accident.

473
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,291
Right?

474
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,816
- I mean, you wouldn't--
- You'll find out everything

475
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,209
soon enough.

476
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:05,391
Uh... maybe
I should, uh...

477
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:07,393
Uh...

478
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,441
It was really nice to
meet you, Elgin.

479
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:20,188
Yeah.

480
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,060
It was nice, uh...

481
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,281
nice meeting
you, too.

482
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,647
How did it go?

483
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,737
You okay?

484
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,217
I'm not afraid anymore.

485
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,438
Oh, baby,
I'm so proud of you.

486
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:56,572
Hey. Nice going.

487
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,574
Can you come help me
peel some potatoes for dinner?

488
00:34:58,618 --> 00:34:59,923
I don't wanna peel potatoes.

489
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,186
Okay. Neither do I.

490
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,578
- Go on.
- Let's go.

491
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:03,579
Come on.

492
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,239
How did he do?

493
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:14,634
- He did great.
- Yeah? Oh, God.

494
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,638
Life lessons
from the Cromenockle.

495
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,466
Who would
have thought?

496
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,369
I'm sorry.

497
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:58,243
I shouldn't
have come here.

498
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,159
Wait.

499
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,211
You take from me.

500
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,262
You take him from me.

501
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,395
Yes.

502
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,703
I take care of you.

503
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,185
But you...

504
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:32,581
you put hate
inside me.

505
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:38,761
I know why you come.

506
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:41,199
You wait.

507
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,529
You take and go.

508
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,750
You never come
here, this place.

509
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,405
You never
come again.

510
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,604
- Are you kidding me?
- Kenny, I just--

511
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:39,735
- Hey!
- Kenny, I--

512
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,433
- What? What?
- I wasn't doing anything.

513
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:42,912
You weren't doing
anything what? Give me that.

514
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,740
- Kenny, please. Kenny, please!
- What the fuck is in it?

515
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,960
Give me that.
Your stuff? Huh?

516
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,788
This is
your stuff, right?

517
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:49,745
Is this Nathan's?

518
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,051
What's that?
Give me that.

519
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,923
- Stop. Stop! No! Please!
- Give me it. Give me it.

520
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,316
What is this?

521
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,491
- This important to you? Huh?
- Kenny.

522
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:57,884
- This is meaningful?
- Kenny, please.

523
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,581
- This mean a lot to you?
- Don't, please.

524
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,627
- Fuck you!
- Oh.

525
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:07,720
Hey. Hey.
Look. Listen.

526
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:08,721
Look at me!

527
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:14,466
I don't care what Boyd says,
and I don't give a shit

528
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,119
how fucking special you
think you are.

529
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:20,602
You ever come near my
mom again, and I swear to God

530
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,562
I will drag your fucking psycho
ass into that Box myself.

531
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,694
Do you
understand me?

532
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:29,350
Do you understand?

533
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,351
Yes.

534
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,436
Can I see?

535
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,524
Hold on.

536
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,874
Almost done.

537
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,880
There we go.

538
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,752
Can I see?

539
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:28,366
Keep in mind... I'm a
little out of practice.

540
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:31,717
Ooh!

541
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,588
I think we did okay.

542
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,596
- I love it.
- Yeah?

543
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,902
Come here.

544
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,949
I look like me again.

545
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,781
Oh, excuse me. Uh...

546
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,217
Hi.

547
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:57,569
Hi. I-- I was
looking for Kristi.

548
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,875
Yeah. That's me. Hi.

549
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,703
Sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

550
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:05,228
Oh, no. It's fine.
How can I help you?

551
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,535
Well, uh...

552
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,017
...since you're
the resident Quincy...

553
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,023
...I was hoping I
could give you this.

554
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,507
Uh, why are you carrying around
liquid morphine?

555
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,560
Mm. Um, when were
you diagnosed?

556
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,650
About a month ago.

557
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,739
I figure that by
the time I need that,

558
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:41,917
I probably won't be
in any shape to...

559
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:44,920
I'll take care
of it, okay?

560
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,444
Thank you.

561
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,750
Look what I did.

562
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:51,057
Ruined such a
nice afternoon.

563
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,148
I'll let you
get back to it.

564
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:57,933
Oh, well, you're better
off in here, anyway.

565
00:40:57,977 --> 00:41:00,283
Oh, there's lots
of hubbub flying around

566
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,808
now that that
Sara girl's back.

567
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,463
I'm sorry. What?

568
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,075
Kristi, where are
you going?

569
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,860
- Baby, stop!
- No! I have to--

570
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:13,122
- Stop!
- I have to go!

571
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,603
Hey, just
talk to me!

572
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,257
Hey! Talk to me!

573
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,520
What is going on?

574
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,957
You're not
going anywhere, okay?

575
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,524
Not like this.

576
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,004
Who is Sara?

577
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,745
She killed somebody,

578
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:29,051
and then she tried to kill
a little boy because I...

579
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:34,143
We were talking one night.
She was at the clinic,

580
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,886
and... and she asked me what I
would do to see you again.

581
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,975
If it was something bad,
would it be worth it?

582
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,020
And I said yes.

583
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,282
I don't...

584
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:43,631
I gave
her permission,

585
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,807
and then the next day,
she-- Fuck.

586
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,682
I just wanted to see
you again so badly that I--

587
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,553
I wasn't even
listening to the question,

588
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,989
and now, you're here,
and I'm wondering

589
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:56,165
if that's my fault,
too. And I just...

590
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,993
No. I just feel like all
I've been doing lately is

591
00:41:58,037 --> 00:42:00,866
- hurting people, and I just--
- No. Hey.

592
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,044
This is
not your fault.

593
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,307
I am here.

594
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,656
Okay?

595
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,875
We're together.

596
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,141
Come inside.

597
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:18,927
Come inside.

598
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:30,548
His name
was Christopher.

599
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,680
Christopher.

600
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:36,771
Come with me.

601
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:38,338
What?
No. Come on.

602
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:39,948
It's right over here.

603
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:50,959
This was his car.

604
00:42:58,097 --> 00:43:01,361
He seemed nice at first,
'cause he made people laugh.

605
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,972
That-- that wasn't an easy
thing to do back then.

606
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:06,801
People liked him.

607
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,022
And then?

608
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:15,680
Then he changed.

609
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:18,247
- Changed how?
- I-- I don't...

610
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,336
I don't like this.
Uh, we should go back.

611
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,991
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

612
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,864
- But we had a deal.
- Mm.

613
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,388
Right? I played your
song. I held up my end.

614
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:29,737
You don't understand.

615
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,391
You shouldn't be asking
these questions.

616
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:32,697
Why? Why? Why?

617
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,002
- Mm.
- Huh?

618
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:38,920
Look. I haven't had
a good night's sleep

619
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:41,749
since I fucking got here,
and I'm-- and I'm seeing things,

620
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:43,838
things that are scaring
the shit out of me.

621
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:47,189
And it's-- and it's all
because of this, right here!

622
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,975
And whoever this Christopher
guy was, he saw it, too!

623
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:51,106
He saw it.
He obsessed over it.

624
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,891
He drew it a thousand
fucking times.

625
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:55,763
So you playing your whole weird,
creepy mystery man routine,

626
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,069
it's not exactly
helping me feel any better!

627
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:58,766
When did he
start seeing the symbol?

628
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,115
- I don't know.
- What does it mean?

629
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:02,161
- I don't know!
- Well, what the fuck

630
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,684
<i>do</i> you know?

631
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:28,013
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:30,668
I'm just...

633
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,324
I know these
things are scary,

634
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:39,024
and... I know that
these aren't things

635
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,810
that you really
want to talk about, but...

636
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:45,683
I am at
the end of my rope.

637
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,077
Please.

638
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:54,822
Everyone died.

639
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,479
When Christopher started
seeing that symbol,

640
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:02,221
things... changed.

641
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:03,439
He changed,

642
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:05,746
and he didn't make
people laugh anymore.

643
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,227
He-- he stopped smiling.

644
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,970
One night, my mother told me
to hide somewhere new,

645
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:14,233
somewhere different, somewhere
Christopher didn't know,

646
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:16,931
and when I woke up
the next morning, everyone...

647
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:27,812
There are
bad things here.

648
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:30,205
They make people
do bad things.

649
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,251
I'm sorry.

650
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:00,235
I'm here!

651
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:09,027
I'm here!

652
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,291
I'm here!

653
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:24,869
Anghkooey!

654
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:27,785
Anghkooey!

655
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:32,877
Anghkooey.

656
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,922
Anghkooey.

657
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,315
Anghkooey!

658
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:37,882
Anghkooey!

659
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:40,885
Anghkooey!

660
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,016
Anghkooey!

661
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,539
Anghkooey.

662
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:48,501
Anghkooey.
Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

663
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:49,850
- Who are you?
- Anghkooey.

664
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,460
- Anghkooey.
- Anghkooey.

665
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:54,463
- Anghkooey.
- I'm not afraid of you.

666
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:56,465
- Anghkooey.
- I'm not afraid of you.

667
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:59,120
Anghkooey, Anghkooey,
Anghkooey, Anghkooey!

668
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:02,297
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

669
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,473
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Don't! Don't! Don't, please!

670
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:07,607
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't!

671
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,304
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

672
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:11,132
- Don't touch me, please!
- Anghkooey!

673
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:13,395
- Please don't touch me!
- Anghkooey!

674
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:16,529
No, no, no! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

675
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:18,879
Anghkooey, Anghkooey,
Anghkooey, Anghkooey.

676
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,359
No! Don't! No! No!

677
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:23,057
Don't touch me! Please don't
touch me! Don't touch me!

678
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:25,103
Don't touch me!

679
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,890
Huh? I don't--

680
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,022
Hey! Hey!

681
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:33,894
- You okay?
- I don't...

682
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:36,114
Did you see that?

683
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:40,466
Your nose is-- your
nose is bleeding.

684
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:43,382
Did you see that? Did you see
them? Where the fuck...

685
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,472
See? See what?

686
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,996
See who?

687
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,347
What?

688
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,496
Boyd.

689
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,586
Look. I don't wanna
do this right now, Jim.

690
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,457
I'm not here to argue.

691
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:19,026
I mean, I don't agree
with what you did, but...

692
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:21,637
...but I looked
at that girl today,

693
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,726
and I didn't see
a psychopath.

694
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,076
I didn't see
a vicious killer.

695
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,295
I saw a broken kid.

696
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,169
And I'm looking
around, and...

697
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:35,564
I'm seeing a lot of people
pushed to their edge.

698
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:37,479
Okay.

699
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:40,656
You ever wonder if
maybe that's the point?

700
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,223
What are you
talking about?

701
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,051
We heard a voice
on the radio.

702
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:47,141
Yeah. Me and Donna,

703
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:49,361
right as the storm
was coming in,

704
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:51,580
and whoever it was,
he knew my name,

705
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:53,408
knew what my wife was
doing in the house,

706
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:56,237
in the basement
of our house.

707
00:48:57,456 --> 00:49:00,241
And I thought
maybe I was crazy.

708
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:01,460
I think people
are watching us.

709
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:04,419
- I think people are listening.
- Jim--

710
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,378
Now, there
are experiments like this

711
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:09,163
going all the way
