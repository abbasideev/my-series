1
00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:03,186
Sometimes I remember
when it wasn't like this.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,180
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,993
Why is there a tree in
the middle of the road?

4
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:09,578
<i>How is this possible?</i>

5
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,345
We're on the same fucking road.

6
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:14,526
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,101
There are things
you need to know

8
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,577
about where you are,

9
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,428
about the way things are now.

10
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:23,133
- Do you believe in monsters?
- Meagan, no!

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,510
We have an arrangement, sheriff.

12
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,645
You don't come here.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,141
I came to see my son, Donna.

14
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,973
We lost a couple of
people last night.

15
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,022
Look, I'm a little busy,
so if that's all...

16
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:34,387
That's all.

17
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:37,573
I built a software company based
on nothing but imagination,

18
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:40,297
but this? It was here
and then it wasn't.

19
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:45,162
There was this weird fucking
symbol right on the ceiling.

20
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,695
What are you looking for, hmm?

21
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,836
I think there's two pages
stuck together here.

22
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:53,986
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:58,480
You're from one
of those two cars?

24
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:00,649
- What do you think it means?
- Please don't.

25
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,295
Victor, take your
peaches and shoo.

26
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:03,857
He's creepy, but he's harmless.

27
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:05,858
He's just been here
a really long time.

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,728
<i>What is that?</i>

29
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:10,813
A faraway Tree. Watch.

30
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,775
It works for people, too.

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,515
- Really?
- Problem is,

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,560
you never know
where you'll end up.

33
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,865
When Thomas died, something
inside of me broke.

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,130
So we pretended
everything was fine,

35
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,271
and I think that just
made everything worse.

36
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:25,597
Sorry.

37
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,608
<i>I just feel so broken.</i>

38
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,538
We're gonna figure
it out together.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,310
Don't worry.

40
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,055
I hear their voices.

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,454
They told me this
was the last one

42
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,931
- Mom!
- Then everyone gets to go home.

43
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,157
- Ow!
- Ethan, run!

44
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,625
No! You don't understand.

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,979
- Nathan, please!
- Nathan.

46
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,253
I wish you had the luxury of
grief, but you don't, Boyd.

47
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:49,948
These people need you.

48
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,968
<i>You need to be the one to
lead these people home.</i>

49
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,146
No!

50
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,932
Stay with me.

51
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,560
<i>The only way for us to go home</i>

52
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,822
<i>is to wake everyone up.</i>

53
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,085
- Abby, stop.
<i>- What happened...</i>

54
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,620
- Mom!
- <i>wasn't your dad's fault.</i>

55
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:04,260
No, no!

56
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:06,660
And it wasn't yours.
It was this place.

57
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,791
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
- No, no. Hey. Hey, no.

58
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,451
This is not goodbye.

59
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:12,001
What is she doing here?

60
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:13,514
She might be helpful
for us to find out

61
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:14,997
what we're looking
for out there.

62
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:16,315
No one can know she's with me.

63
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,665
Where are we going?

64
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,395
To find our way home.

65
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,092
How about you and I
have an adventure?

66
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:22,729
The game's gonna be called

67
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,344
<i>"Where does the
light come from?"</i>

68
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,209
<i>You don't think the
tower's gonna work?</i>

69
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,437
You guys look at Colony House

70
00:02:28,462 --> 00:02:30,990
and figure it's all just
drinking and fucking.

71
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:32,600
<i>It was more than that.</i>

72
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,027
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

73
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,466
<i>There was joy in that house.</i>

74
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,255
If it does work, I
think you'll find

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,397
there's more you're gonna
miss about this place

76
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,670
than you thought.

77
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,195
Iceland. Nice.

78
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,521
If this radio thing works,

79
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:46,644
maybe we could go.

80
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,045
I'm engaged.

81
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,587
Part of me really
wants to go back

82
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,906
<i>and find out the woman I fell
in love with waited for me.</i>

83
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,185
What does the other part want?

84
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,448
To go to Iceland with the
most amazing guy I met.

85
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:56,969
You are the love of my life.

86
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,635
We could be anywhere
in the world,

87
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,550
but it would not matter
because you are my home.

88
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,020
It's working.

89
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,681
We got a signal!

90
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:08,374
- Where are you?
<i>- Is this Jim?</i>

91
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,792
<i>Your wife shouldn't be
digging that hole, Jim.</i>

92
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,625
What the fuck?

93
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,236
You're here. We have to go.

94
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,663
- This is where they sleep.
- Oh, my God.

95
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,537
Tabitha!

96
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:33,655
It's angry now.

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,802
You have to get inside.
You'll be safe in there.

98
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,577
I'll follow behind.

99
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,551

winch tied down.

177
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,170
That looks like a car radio.

178
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,482
These, guys. These
speakers. Grab the speakers.

179
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:01,860
Get everything inside.

180
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:05,556
Fuck!

181
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,746
One more piece
of that. Hold on.

182
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,850
See if you can tie it down.

183
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,670
With what? There's
nothing up here.

184
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,790
Fuck me.

185
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,180
Donna, why did my dad
run off like that?

186
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,810
- Julie, please.
- I'm on it.

187
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,385
Donna! Donna!

188
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,760
We have a problem.

189
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:28,505
- Get the kids upstairs.
- What?

190
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,946
- Ethan? Hey, hey.
- Get them upstairs.

191
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,076
- Donna!
- How about you and I

192
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,655
go upstairs, huh?

193
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,780
Ellis, go get her!
Bring her back here!

194
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:39,873
I got it.

195
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:41,488
- Donna?!
- Don't touch it.

196
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:43,750
We're gonna take you in the
kitchen and clean you up, okay?

197
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,346
- Donna?
- Check the windows

198
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,920
and lock this place down.

199
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:48,997
- Donna!!
- What?

200
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:53,023
There is a bus parked
outside the diner!

201
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,480
Tabitha?

202
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,270
Are you down there?

203
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,980
Shit.

204
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
Tabitha?

205
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Come on, baby. Please.

206
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,260
Come.

207
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,490
Come.

208
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,810
- Where are we going?
- Shh! We can't talk.

209
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,977
They're close now.
You'll wake them.

210
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,620
- Wake who?
- Shh!

211
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,416
No, no, no. Victor,
we need to stop.

212
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
You need to tell
me what's going on.

213
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,940
- Where are we?
- We're underneath the town.

214
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,290
This is where the monsters
live. This is where they sleep.

215
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,810
But I can get us out.

216
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,725
The boy in white, he
showed me the way.

217
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,165
The what?

218
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,780
I went through the
tree, then I was here.

219
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,966
He told me to wait for you.
He showed me where to hide.

220
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,109
It's okay to be scared.

221
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:12,135
We just need to be quiet.

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,860
We just have to...

223
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,150
- What the fuck?
- What?

224
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,930
We have to hurry.
They'll be awake soon.

225
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Yeah.

226
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,023
- Deep breath, okay?
- Okay.

227
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,723
Yeah. Don't touch.

228
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,279
All right. One, two... three.

229
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,011
Aah!

230
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,830
Don't touch it, okay?
You're doing great.

231
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,515
All right. Don't
touch. Don't touch.

232
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,080
Tell everyone unless
they're bleeding,

233
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,812
they better be securing
the goddamn windows.

234
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:50,976
Okay.

235
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,005
- Mattias, grab the shotguns.
- Got it.

236
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,404
We don't need to do that.

237
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,489
No?

238
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,610
There's a fucking
bus down there.

239
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,467
God knows how many
people with zero idea

240
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:03,400
of the shit storm
they just rolled into.

241
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:05,095
How do you think
they're gonna react

242
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,920
when we tell them
they can't leave?

243
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,096
Look.

244
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,051
We have a long
night ahead of us.

245
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,799
Boyd picked one hell of
a time to go on safari.

246
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:20,626
If this shit goes sideways, you
have to be ready to step up.

247
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,651
You got that?

248
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,280
You're sheriff now.

249
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,871
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

250
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:28,966
Grab your stuff. Meet
us down at the diner.

251
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:30,736
We're about to make
some new friends.

252
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
It's locked.

253
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,870
Fuckin' shirt.

254
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,270
You all, come join me!

255
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,550
Ha ha!

256
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,106
Whoo! Whoo!

257
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,195
Ahh.

258
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,280
Oh, the sun! Ha ha ha!

259
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,860
No way.

260
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:03,574
Ah. Rain dance is done.

261
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,841
Just follow my finger
with your eyes.

262
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:09,586
Good.

263
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,880
Great. Okay. Can
I see your hand?

264
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,940
Okay, pulse is good.

265
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,726
No sign of a fever.

266
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,435
Look, I need
everybody off the bus.

267
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,090
Seriously?

268
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:26,667
Just give us a minute. Please?

269
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,005
You a doctor or something?

270
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,970
Pediatric nurse.

271
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,190
Oh.

272
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,100
Hey.

273
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,880
Hey, what's your name?

274
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,270
Elgin.

275
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,400
Elgin?

276
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,388
Elgin, do you know
where you are?

277
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,710
Do you?

278
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,659
Why were you
screaming like that?

279
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,300
I had a really bad dream.

280
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:01,636
Hey. Hey, what
the fuck was that?

281
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,040
- Hey.
- Back off, man.

282
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,000
Why don't you back
off? I'm the one

283
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,225
with fuckin' puke on my shirt.

284
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,230
What the fuck is wrong with you?

285
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,590
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,123
You're a goddamn freak.

287
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:13,633
Let's give him some space, okay?

288
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,665
Excuse me.

289
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,920
You alright, man?

290
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,616
Smells fuckin' terrible in here.

291
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,980
Asshole.

292
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,370
Hey, cut the guy a break.

293
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,800
Do you wanna go outside?

294
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,020
Elgin?

295
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,522
How about I just sit here
with you until you're ready?

296
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,810
Okay?

297
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,217
Okay.

298
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,750
Oh, my God.

299
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,400
Julie! Hey.

300
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,145
- I need to find my dad.
- Wait, wait, wait.

301
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,750
Ellis! Pretty crazy, huh?

302
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,562
Maybe the magic
tower summoned them.

303
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,223
You ever see
something like this?

304
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:10,001
- Dad? Dad?
- Nope. These people are fucked.

305
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,633
Everybody? Everybody
gather round.

306
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:15,460
Gather round. Just want
y'all to sit tight.

307
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,805
I'm gonna clean things up in
there and we'll be on our way.

308
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,618
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

309
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,357
Uh, listen.

310
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:23,166
There's gonna be a bunch of
people on their way down.

311
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,340
- Mmm.
- Um...

312
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,226
And they're gonna help
you guys out, alright?

313
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,061
So we'll get the diner unlocked,

314
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,700
and we'll get you
guys sorted out.

315
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,457
Okay, well, this isn't
a pit stop, okay?

316
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:35,093
So unless you have a
mop, I'm good. Thanks.

317
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,790
Holy shit.

318
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,225
What happened?

319
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,000
- The floor just...
- I don't know.

320
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,190
Where's Mom?

321
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,169
I, uh... Ethan?

322
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:51,916
Uh, where's Ethan?

323
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:53,530
He's fine. He's at Colony.

324
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,610
Dad, is she down there?

325
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,500
Julie, listen to me.

326
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,240
I need you to get help, okay?

327
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,020
Get as many people as you can.

328
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,630
Julie!

329
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,910
Okay. All right.
Come here. Come here.

330
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,440
Now is the time for
you to be strong.

331
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,435
Your mom needs you, okay?

332
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,110
Go and get help.

333
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,503
- Okay.
- Go. Now.

334
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,540
- You sure you're okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

335
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,012
- Okay. Just let me know...
- Ellis!

336
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,492
If you need anything.
What's wrong?

337
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:38,131
- It's my mom. She's trapped.
- Wait, wait. What?

338
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,002
She was digging in the
basement. My dad's inside.

339
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,675
- She needs help. Please.
- Whoa, whoa. Stay with the bus.

340
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,290
- I got this.
- You sure?

341
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:45,636
You're not gonna
do much with that.

342
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,470
I'm a bartender. Crowd
control's my thing.

343
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,860
Hey, people? We got a little
situation on our hands here.

344
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,125
Listen up.

345
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,020
There's a woman
trapped in the basement

346
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:57,435
of that house over there.
Her husband's inside.

347
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,990
We could use some help.

348
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,225
Yeah. All right.

349
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,920
Yeah. I'll help.

350
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,356
- I'm going.
- No, no, no. Just stay there.

351
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,920
Hey, no. I need everyone
to stay by the bus.

352
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,485
Well, there's a woman
trapped in there.

353
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,478
Then let emergency
services handle it.

354
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, you're a peach.

355
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,020
Okay. Okay, look. You guys go.

356
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,620
Listen. There are
people on the way.

357
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,180
They're gonna help
everyone out, okay?

358
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,066
They're gonna get everything
squared up. You're with...

359
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,980
- Hey! Hey, no. Whoa.
- I'm going, too.

360
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:26,087
They can't focus on your mom if
they're worried about you. Okay?

361
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:30,595
Okay, come on. You're
needed here. Come with me.

362
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,423
Remember, the most
important thing is...

363
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,597
Keep everybody calm. I know.

364
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:39,072
Uh, you talk to the bus driver,
and I'll get everyone inside.

365
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,903
- Let's go.
- Donna.

366
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:44,076
We've got some problems.

367
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,120
No shit. Where's the driver?

368
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:49,627
Folks, sorry about your
inconvenience here.

369
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:52,835
Let's get you all inside,
huh? Get some tea brewing.

370
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,916
Get you all warmed up.

371
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:57,849
Sounds like a good idea.

372
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:00,351
- Right? Some tea sounds good.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

373
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:03,746
Come on in, guys. Please.

374
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,680
Let's go, folks. Come on.

375
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,150
Sorry again.

376
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,470
Jim!

377
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,331
Oh, thank God.

378
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,510
Who are they?

379
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,170
We, uh... our
bus stopped here.

380
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,228
- Your bus?
- Can you hear anything?

381
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,927
- Is she talking?
- No.

382
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,641
I, uh... no.

383
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:34,036
What the fuck? What was
she doin' down here?

384
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,000
Digging to see where
the wires went.

385
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,520
It doesn't matter.

386
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,250
If she was digging down here,

387
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,153
what the hell caused that?

388
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,935
Please just help me.

389
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,070
Hey, bud, look at
me. Look at me.

390
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:52,540
We're gonna get your
lady out of there, okay?

391
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,386
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

392
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,454
Before you lift anything out,

393
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,458
just make sure that it's not
holding up somethin' else.

394
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,254
Last thing we want is to
collapse things further.

395
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,380
Okay. Yeah. We got this.

396
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,160
Let's get this done
quickly, alright?

397
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,420
Yeah. Come here.
Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:14,793
Come.

399
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,406
Come on.

400
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,752
Are you sure this
is the right way?

401
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:21,916
Shh.

402
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:30,954
Oh, no, no, no. Victor.

403
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,299
No, we have to keep going.

404
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,657
No, no, no, Victor.
We have to go back.

405
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,558
No way. There's no going
back. We have to go through.

406
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,473
That's what he said.
We go while they sleep.

407
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,110
You have to be brave. We
both have to be brave.

408
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,386
Sara?

409
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,936
Sara, you up there?

410
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,416
You said we'd be safe
inside this tree.

411
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,234
Well, this does not feel
very safe to me, Sara.

412
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:13,976
Hey.

413
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,760
Hello?

414
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,240
Hey, is anybody up there?

415
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,560
Are you real?

416
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:31,635
What?

417
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,735
Are you real?

418
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:41,254
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm real.

419
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,819
Are you? Are you fuckin' real?

420
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:47,055
I can help you if you help me.

421
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,230
Okay.

422
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,060
You promise?

423
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:51,750
Yeah, man. Anything you want.

424
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:55,300
Just please, just get
me outta here, man.

425
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,410
You'll have to climb.

426
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:58,675
What?

427
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,453
No. I...

428
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:02,716
I can't.

429
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,670
I just... tried.

430
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,890
Wait.

431
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,056
Hey. What... fuck!

432
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,253
What?

433
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,348
You have to hurry.
They'll be back soon.

434
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:25,765
Okay. All right. Uh, okay.

435
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,180
Hey.

436
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:36,897
Do you think we made it angry?

437
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,320
What are you talking about?

438
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:40,476
That storm came out of nowhere,

439
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:42,509
and the way the lights exploded,

440
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,750
it's almost like we
made something angry.

441
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,670
What do we do now?

442
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,077
Well...

443
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,996
I got one rolling paper left...

444
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,528
so I'm getting stoned.

445
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,510
Okay.

446
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,479
Okay. Okay.

447
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,448
Here. I found this.

448
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,005
There's a lot of broken glass.

449
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:56,974
You careful.

450
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,253
Why do you think they broke?

451
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:03,536
That was scary.

452
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,440
Very scary.

453
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,620
Do you think the others
will be back soon?

454
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,945
You don't be afraid.
I protect you.

455
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,320
I'm not afraid.

456
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:23,515
Well, maybe a little afraid.

457
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,035
Sometimes a quest can be scary.

458
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,251
And when it gets
close to the end,

459
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:31,385
that's when it
gets really scary.

460
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,907
I guess we're
sleeping here tonight?

461
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,520
Whatever.

462
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,580
What are you doing out here?

463
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:48,135
Oh, for fuck's sake.

464
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,840
Go back inside.

465
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,540
Why?

466
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:56,169
Because...

467
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,450
You know, I don't know,
kid. Do whatever you want.

468
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,850
You know cigarettes
are bad for you, right?

469
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:04,646
It's not that kind of cigarette.

470
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,002
What's wrong with you?

471
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,730
Gee, I don't know.

472
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:12,215
I mean...

473
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,535
maybe I just spent
the last week thinking

474
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,059
we might actually get
out of this shit box,

475
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:18,864
only to see our entire plan
come crashing down around us.

476
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:19,989
Literally.

477
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,665
So? We try again.

478
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,168
Yeah.

479
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:26,133
We'll get right on that, kid.

480
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:28,188
Maybe we'll try something else.

481
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,150
Whenever the Cromenockle
failed, he always found...

482
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:32,386
What the fuck is a Cromenockle?

483
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,265
- Oh. Um...
- No. I don't care.

484
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,060
You're friends
with Victor, right?

485
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,090
Do you know which room is his?

486
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,370
Why?

487
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,470
Okay. Shh.

488
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,829
Look. Right here.

489
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:21,296
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

490
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,580
Let's go. Let's go.
Please, please, let's go.

491
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,916
Oh, my God.

492
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,420
Oh, my God.

493
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,679
- Victor?
- Shh.

494
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:02,183
What?

495
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,950
- No, Victor!
- Come on.

496
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:21,722
Victor, Victor, Victor?

497
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,526
Victor, Victor?

498
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,710
Victor, which way?

499
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,596
Victor?

500
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,558
I don't know. I got scared.

501
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,996
What?

502
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,521
This isn't the way
that he told me to go.

503
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:49,853
What?

504
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,428
No, no, no. Victor, Victor.

505
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:55,488
- Hey. Listen to me, Victor.
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

506
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:56,725
Look at me. Look at me.

507
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,120
Yeah.

508
00:27:58,185 --> 00:27:59,822
I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too,

509
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,688
but we have to
fucking move, okay?

510
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,473
Please. Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

511
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,240
We're going to do
this together, okay?

512
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,389
It's okay. Let's
go. Please, Victor.

513
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,273
Come on, Victor.
Please, please, please.

514
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,670
Let's go.

515
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,907
Let's go here.

516
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,660
There's gotta be something here!

517
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:23,925
You shouldn't be doing this.

518
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,725
Victor wouldn't like it.

519
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,060
All right. Well, I
got news for you, kid.

520
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:31,365
Victor is, uh, he's
probably dead, alright?

521
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,110
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,900
I shouldn't have said that.

523
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,295
It's okay,

524
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,160
'cause you're
wrong. He's fine.

525
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:44,318
Wherever he is,
he's doing his part.

526
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,973
Yeah? His part of what?

527
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:47,280
The quest.

528
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,950
Sorry, the what?

529
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:53,605
That's what this
is. It's a quest,

530
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,766
and everyone has a
part to play. Even you.

531
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,790
Why do you care so
much about Victor?

532
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:02,042
Because...

533
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,443
All right, look.

534
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:09,588
Between you and me, alright,

535
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:12,920
I have been seeing some
very crazy shit lately.

536
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,850
You swear a lot.

537
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:18,923
Get over here. The point is,

538
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:22,348
every time I see something
really weird, I see this.

539
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:24,907
This symbol.

540
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:27,390
Okay.

541
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:29,652
Okay? I didn't draw this,
though. I found this.

542
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:31,778
Well, Kenny's mom gave
me tea, and then she...

543
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,164
When she... Anyway, look.

544
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,317
The point is, this
journal is old, alright?

545
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,452
And whoever it belonged to kept
drawing the same weird symbol

546
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,407
that I have been seeing

547
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:43,553
over and over and over again.

548
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:49,472
I've been looking at this,
and then the other night,

549
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,150
I noticed two of the
pages were stuck together.

550
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,195
And in between there,
there's this, uh,

551
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,150
this old Polaroid.

552
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:59,635
- What's a Polaroid?
- Jesus fuckin' Christ. It's a...

553
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,699
I'm sorry. It's a photo. It's
like a little photograph.

554
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,603
How do you not know what
a Polaroid is? Come on.

555
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:06,365
Here, look. This. See this?

556
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,053
What do you see?

557
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:12,313
He's got the journal.

558
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,990
Yeah.

559
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,398
What else?

560
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,840
That's Victor's lunchbox.

561
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:20,981
Ah. Not just
Victor's lunchbox.

562
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:23,471
That's Victor.

563
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,969
- Really?
- Yeah.

564
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,210
And if he was here back
when that guy was here...

565
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,640
He might know what
the symbol means.

566
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,035
Exactly.

567
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,468
And that's why I'm in his room.

568
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,431
- So, we good?
- Well...

569
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:42,663
symbols are important,

570
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,590
especially on a quest.

571
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:45,805
Yeah?

572
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,073
But you have to figure out

573
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,012
if they're good
symbols or bad symbols.

574
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,523
Well, what do you mean?

575
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,144
What do you mean, "bad symbols"?

576
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:59,527
Sometimes, they make
you do bad things.

577
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,380
You're a creepy little kid.

578
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,060
Okay. One big step.

579
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:18,648
There you go.

580
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:19,827
They will rip you to shreds.

581
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,127
Let's just head around
the front, okay?

582
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:22,484
It goes on and on.

583
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:24,195
The point is, these
things don't just kill.

584
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,455
Hold on. Stop.

585
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,850
Is this... are you out
of your fucking mind?

586
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:29,773
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

587
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:31,682
and there is not a single
reason in the world

588
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:32,529
you should trust me.

589
00:31:32,554 --> 00:31:34,522
But if you get those
people back on this bus

590
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:36,320
and try to drive out of
here, if you're outside

591
00:31:36,344 --> 00:31:38,222
- when the sun goes down...
- Know what? I'm done.

592
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:39,653
- Excuse me. Excuse me!
- No. Please.

593
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:40,677
Seriously.

594
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,533
You can't go back on that bus.

595
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:44,475
Get out of my way.

596
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,109
I can't do that.

597
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:50,013
There's something.

598
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,225
There's something, uh...

599
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,405
there's a chamber or
something underneath.

600
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,830
- Let's lift this thing. Ready?
- Yeah. One, two...

601
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,360
Oh, whoa!

602
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,033
Elgin, you okay?

603
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:06,833
Uh, I was just a little dizzy.

604
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,598
Okay. You wanna go inside?

605
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,264
We'll try and get
you some water.

606
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,395
I can help you.

607
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,083
Nice and slow.

608
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,119
- You okay?
- Ooh. Whoa, whoa.

609
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,516
Are you okay? Shit. Shit.

610
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:23,385
Elgin?

611
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:25,183
I need some help over here!

612
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:28,097
Places don't just
come apart like this.

613
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,539
- Jim?
- Uh, wait. We're almost there.

614
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:32,243
Hey. Help me. Help me.

615
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:33,507
- What happened?
- I don't know.

616
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:34,940
- He just started seizing.
- Okay. Easy, easy.

617
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:36,604
Elgin, I'm gonna put
this under your head.

618
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:39,827
Aw, fuck!

619
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,356
I need you to help me
roll him on his side.

620
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,930
One, two, three.

621
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,312
He was sick on the bus.
Stay with me, Elgin.

622
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:46,896
It's okay. You're
gonna be okay.

623
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
You gotta get out of
there, man. Come on, Jim.

624
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:50,305
This is the beam
that I gotta get out.

625
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,330
Hey, you're okay.
Keep breathing.

626
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:57,195
There you go. Good.

627
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,253
Let's go! Let's go.

628
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,290
Let's go!

629
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,135
- Jim!
- I'm not leaving.

630
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,509
- Dad!
- Julie!

631
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,230
- Dad!
- Julie, no. Be careful. Stop.

632
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:29,626
- Wait!
- Dad, can you hear me?

633
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,020
Jim!

634
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:40,689
- Dad?
- Jim?

635
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,209
Dad, are you down there?

636
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,431
If anyone else is down there...

637
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,915
- Dad!
- Jim?

638
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,090
Dad! Dad, can you hear me?

639
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,533
Dad?

640
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:54,043
Jim, can you hear me?

641
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:56,260
Hello? Dad, Dad?

642
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:59,369
- Jim.
- Dad, just hang on, okay?

643
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,830
Dad, if you can hear
us, just please hang on.

644
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:06,559
- Dad, are you there?
- Just hang on, okay?

645
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,700
Dad? Dad, talk to me, please.

646
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:12,970
- Dad, Dad!
- Julie.

647
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:15,288
- Julie?
- Dad, can you hear me?

648
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:16,681
Julie?

649
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:17,946
- Dad!
- Julie?

650
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:19,330
Over there.

651
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:21,106
- Dad, I'm here.
- Julie?

652
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:23,590
Jim, we're gonna get you
out of there, alright?

653
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:25,664
Is there anyone else
down there with you?

654
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,194
You guys better hurry.

655
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,409
- Over there.
- Tom!

656
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,710
Dad, it's okay.

657
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,732
Tom, is there anyone with you?

658
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,352
Hey, hey. Careful.
Careful with that.

659
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,364
The kid with the
jacket, he's not moving.

660
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,497
Is he breathing?

661
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,396
I can't tell.

662
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:48,880
Dad, listen to me, okay?
We're gonna get you out.

663
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,665
- We just, uh...
- Be careful when you get...

664
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:54,445
I want you to stay with Donna.

665
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,150
You do whatever she says, and
you do not leave her side.

666
00:34:58,237 --> 00:35:00,242
Dad, Dad, we're gonna
get you out, okay?

667
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,486
Uh, we just... We
need to do something.

668
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:04,156
- Jim, we're gonna get you out.
- Hey. I got someone!

669
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,340
Who else is down there with you?

670
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,435
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

671
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,567
- Hey, man, you alright?
- Yeah.

672
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:10,311
- Yeah, he's okay.
- Get him down here.

673
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:12,046
- I'm coming.
- Easy. Stand up.

674
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:13,423
Hey, hey, hey.

675
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:14,808
- Kristi, can you grab him?
- Yeah.

676
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,071
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

677
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,283
- I got you. I got you.
- Hold me. Yeah, good.

678
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:19,549
- I can't see anyone.
- Whoa, whoa!

679
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:21,340
Watch your step,
guys. Come on.

680
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:22,480
- Easy, easy.
- Whoa! Whoa!

681
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:23,657
- You got him? Alright.
- Nice and slow.

682
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:25,011
- You're good.
- Alright, Kristi.

683
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:26,234
- Make sure he's okay.
- Okay. You're good.

684
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,772
- Whoa, whoa! Okay sit.
- I wanna sit down.

685
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,947
We're gonna get you
outta there, alright?

686
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,010
- Any pain when I touch at all?
- No.

687
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:39,660
- Down your back here? No?
- No, no.

688
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,760
What is this?

689
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,543
It's okay, Victor.

690
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,318
It's okay. It's okay.

691
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:41,522
You shouldn't have done that.

692
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,156
- Okay.
- We have to go.

693
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,282
Hey, wait. Where's
the water coming from?

694
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:51,717
They're waking up.

695
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:53,276
What?

696
00:36:56,316 --> 00:37:00,499
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God!

697
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:06,060
Victor, Victor, Victor.

698
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:08,535
No, no, no! There's a tunnel.

699
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,280
Please, follow it all
the way up. Go, go, go!

700
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,014
Go, go, go. Go, go, go!

701
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,325
Look up. Good. Any blurriness?

702
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,720
Trouble seeing at all? No?

703
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:19,200
- No.
- You're good?

704
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:22,484
Okay. Squeeze my
hand. Squeeze. Good.

705
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:24,945
Are you feeling okay?
How are you feeling?

706
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,094
You guys still good?

707
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,734
- Here's some water.
- Stay with him.

708
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,058
Wait. Where are you
going? I have to...

709
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,870
Gotta get something
from the bus.

710
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,072
Take it easy.

711
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,073
Okay.

712
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,440
It's okay now.

713
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,750
What?

714
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,670
What?

715
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,340
Dad?

716
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,910
Dad?

717
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,310
It's getting dark. You said
we'd take the boat out.

718
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,115
You okay down there?

719
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,190
Yeah.

720
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,310
Great.

721
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:33,533
Go.

722
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,770
Victor, okay. Go, go, go.

723
00:39:36,795 --> 00:39:39,052
Go, go, go. Go, Victor, go!

724
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:44,103
Victor?

725
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:48,852
Victor, Victor?
Victor, which way?

726
00:39:48,877 --> 00:39:50,126
What? I don't know.

727
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,837
Which way, Victor? Which way?

728
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:54,957
We have to... We have to go.

729
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:56,471
This way.

730
00:40:03,883 --> 00:40:06,853
Alright, everybody,
back on the bus.

731
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,938
No, there are people
trapped in there.

732
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:11,614
That's right, and we need
emergency crews here,

733
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,511
and when we get to the next
town, we'll send some help.

734
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,199
Let's go!

735
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:18,352
Mattias, keep an eye on her.

736
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:21,655
- Yeah. Got it.
- Let's try... Let's try again.

737
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,220
Hey. Let's clear this piece.

738
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:24,988
Okay. Let's see
if we can pull it.

739
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:25,978
Yeah.

740
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,093
Slide this over
and give me a hand.

741
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:29,069
- Good. You got it.
- Watch out.

742
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,838
Aah! Whoa. Wait. Wait,
wait, wait! Stop, stop.

743
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:35,162
Wait, wait, wait. Guys, stop.

744
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,467
- Hold the work.
- Everyone stop.

745
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:40,665
Don't move anything else.

746
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,320
Everything here is
resting on something else.

747
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,500
If you move anything
too quickly,

748
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,590
all the rest of it
could come down.

749
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,135
Jim, we don't have
time to be delicate.

750
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,935
Yeah. We can't just stop.

751
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,420
In order to get us
all three out safely,

752
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:59,035
you have to do it slowly,

753
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,550
and you gotta do it right.

754
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:03,498
Dad, the sun is
about to go down.

755
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:04,623
I know.

756
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,697
That's why you're
gonna leave us here.

757
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:17,361
What? What? No. No, no,
no. We're not doing that.

758
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:18,981
- Okay? We're not.
- Yes, yes.

759
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:20,825
If we cover them
up, leave right now,

760
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,986
those things might not
know they're down there.

761
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,628
We have to give them a
talisman or something.

762
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,053
It won't work.

763
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,705
You can't just wear
them around your neck.

764
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:31,229
They have to be
inside something...

765
00:41:31,254 --> 00:41:33,581
A house, a car. There's
nothing down there.

766
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:35,346
Listen, Julie.

767
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,290
I survived here
for almost a year

768
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:40,205
before Boyd found
those talismans.

769
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:41,640
If these guys stay quiet,

770
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,318
there's a really
good chance that...

771
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,730
Oh, for fuck's sake!

772
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:47,641
Fuck. Kenny?

773
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:50,995
Yeah. Can you please go into
the diner, grab some tarps?

774
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,510
Yeah, okay.

775
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,190
All right. Everyone
on, right now.

776
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,235
We're leaving. Come on.

777
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,950
Hold on!

778
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:03,750
Turn off that goddamn bus.

779
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:05,293
You stay away from us.

780
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:07,495
You're gonna get people
killed, you realize that?

781
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:11,223
If you want to stay, you
can make arrangements

782
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,451
with emergency services
once they arrive.

783
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:15,806
There are no emergency services.

784
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,261
If you're still outside
when the sun goes down,

785
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,086
you and everyone else on this
little death trap are gonna die.

786
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:23,177
Whoa, whoa. What the hell
is she talking about?

787
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:25,075
I'm gonna say this once.

788
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,940
None of you are safe here.

789
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,075
Things are gonna get
really fucking scary

790
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,820
when the sun goes down,

791
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:34,165
and if you're outside,
you are going to die.

792
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,483
If you want more
of an explanation,

793
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,811
then I'm happy to give it to
you when things settle down.

794
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:39,513
But meanwhile, if you want
to live through the night,

795
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:42,269
you need to get your ass
back inside that diner.

796
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:44,278
Everybody on board.

797
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:46,641
What does she mean,
"Everybody's gonna die"?

798
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,136
Calm down. Calm
down for a second.

799
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:50,232
- Fuck this!
- Everyone needs to calm down.

800
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:51,257
Calm down for...

801
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:52,512
Are we supposed
to buy that shit?

802
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,792
Calm down.

803
00:42:56,638 --> 00:43:00,655
- I gotta be in...
- You don't understand!

804
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,310
Start the fucking
bus. Start the...

805
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:04,814
Donna, no!

806
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:06,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

807
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,160
- Stop!
- Wait!

808
00:43:12,185 --> 00:43:15,344
- Oh, my God.
- Fatima, get back here!

809
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:17,559
We can't just leave them!

810
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,103
Hey, come back!

811
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:20,883
- Fatima.
- Fatima!

812
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:23,655
- Stop!
- Fatima!

813
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,830
Inside the diner, now!

814
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:28,225
Get inside. Get inside.

815
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:29,586
Get inside!

816
00:43:29,611 --> 00:43:32,895
- Julie?
- Dad? Dad, I'm here.

817
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Oh.

818
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,100
I, uh, I heard gunshots?

819
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:39,283
Yeah. They just...

820
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:41,598
They needed to get
everybody into the diner.

821
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:44,815
Julie, there's, uh...
there's a cavern,

822
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,555
or some kind of space,
underneath the basement.

823
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,380
What?

824
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:52,795
I saw it when we were
clearing the debris.

825
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:56,035
If your mother
made it down there,

826
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,004
then that means she's okay.

827
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,680
You hear me?

828
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:07,982
So, if you could just
wait for her to get back,

829
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:10,539
then you'll be okay.

830
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,291
- We're gonna get you out, Dad.
- I know, sweetie. I know.

831
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:17,797
You just be strong, okay?

832
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:19,985
Julie? Julie, the
sun's almost down.

833
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,489
- We have to get inside.
- No.

834
00:44:21,514 --> 00:44:22,748
He's right.

835
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:25,540
The longer you stay out there,

836
00:44:25,565 --> 00:44:27,935
the more chance they
realize we're down here.

837
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,984
Come on.

838
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:31,499
You've got to go.

839
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,020
It's okay, honey.

840
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,868
I love you.

841
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,220
I love you, too.

842
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:47,396
Come on. Let's go.

843
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:51,144
You two guys, too. Come
on. You have to trust me.

844
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:53,472
We have to get inside.
Let's go. Come on. Please?

845
00:44:53,512 --> 00:44:55,962
Let's go. Inside. Inside!

846
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:15,329
Got it.

847
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,205
You made it.

848
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,330
What the...

849
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:27,347
I wasn't sure you would.

850
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:29,457
It's such a long climb.

851
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:34,616
We don't have much time.

852
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:40,043
Is that a gun?

853
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:42,893
Yeah.

854
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:45,419
Oh.

855
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:48,183
My eyes, they're not
what they used to be.

856
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,630
It's good that you have a gun.

857
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,840
That'll make it easy.

858
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,580
Make what easy?

859
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,540
I need you to kill me.
