in cobalt.

176
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,876
The hero, the every man, mentor,
the mystic

177
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,127
- the lover.
- Mom.

178
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,255
And there's Jungian archetypes.

179
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,674
Why didn't you tell me
that you Airbnb'd your house?

180
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,175
I did, didn't I?

181
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,344
I drove around two campgrounds
looking for you.

182
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,055
If you don't check-in with me,
that's on you.

183
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,890
I called you 14 times.

184
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,017
[Basil] Is that Alexandra? Bloody hell.

185
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,895
You disturbed the Airbnb people?

They're gonna leave a shit review now,
you fair dinkum monster.

187
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,818
I can't deal with him
and his fake Australian accent.

188
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,362
It's not fake. I was born in Perth, so...

189
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,157
- I'm sure you were, Cilantro.
- Don't call Basil Cilantro, Alex.

190
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,034
Our identity is subjective.

191
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,911
He's Australian, I'm French-Italian.

192
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,664
In reality, we're both
100 percent Icelandic fairy.

193
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,166
Can I talk to you in private?
I'm in a rush, Mom.

194
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,253
No. Whatever you can say to me,
you can say in front of him.

195
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,339
Because he is my life
and business partner.

196
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,716
What business?

197
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,303
Renting your house out,
or making you sleep in an RV?

You're a malignant tumor.

- All right. Enough.

You want something from me,
so just ask. What is it?

Can you watch Maddy?
I have a job interview. One hour, two max.

204
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,285
Of course. She's my granddaughter.

205
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,414
She is always welcome to experience me
and be a part of my life.

Okay, Mom?

208
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,005
- Nod that you hear me.
- Nod.

209
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,759
Don't drive her anywhere. Do you have
food here? Can you give her lunch?

210
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,470
- We're a pub now, are we?
- Anything goes wrong, call me.

211
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,055
Don't call Sean. Call me.

If this is another summons,
shove it up your ass.

No, I'm Alex. Jody sent me.

Oh, one of Jody's girls.

227

Poor thing. Not you. Jody.
Being a social worker sucks.

228
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,443
So you're on parole?

229
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,403
Um, no.

230
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,864
- Got any priors?
- No.

231
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,199
I'll check. Got a problem
with a background check?

232
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,412
- No.
- We pay that, no exceptions.

233
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,874
Bump you up 50 cents once the background
check clears and you go full-time.

234
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,710
Full-time, great.

235
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,921
Yes, but full-time ain't a 40-hour week.

236
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,632
Company policy is you can't work
more than six hours a day.

237
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,343
More than six hours,
bitches start throwing their backs out,

238
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,263
which breaks my heart, it does,
but I can't be paying benefits.

239
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,933
So it's capped. Six hours a day, max.

240
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,479
Okay.

241
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,692
And tourist season's over,
so I really only have one shift open.

242
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,862
It's a weekly three-hour clean
over on Fisher Island.

243
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,240
One shift. Okay.

244
00:17:55,324 --> 00:18:00,120
So uniform is 25 bucks.

basically everything else
except the Dyson.

253

If you don't return the Dyson to me
directly after the shift,

254
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,903
- you don't get paid. Understand?
- Yes, I do.

<i>Your call has been forwarded

346
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,428
Maddy?

347
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,723
Maddy, are you in here? Maddy?

348
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,480
[banging noise]

349
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,734
Mom, can't you hear me calling?
What the fuck?

350
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:42,947
Calling me? It was me
that was calling you many, many times.

351
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,909
- Okay. Where is Maddy?
- I have a life of my own, you know?

352
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:51,122
I can't be watching children all day.
I have work to do. My own work, okay?

353
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,541
Basil, are you in here? Open the door!

354
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,879
I bet you'd like to get in there with him.
I see how you act around him.

355
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,590
Always flirting with him,
sticking your little titties out.

356
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,009
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where is Maddy?

357
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,971
- I'm taking a nap. Jesus.
- Why can't you be happy for me?

358
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,056
She's not here.

359
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,309
That I can still attract
a quality man like him.

360
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,561
- Okay, where is she?
- We couldn't reach you

361
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,815
and your mom got tired,
so we called Sean to get her.

362
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:25,031
You have never seen my potential.
I am soaring on the cliff.

363
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:30,662
The sun beams towards me.
It fills me with light!

364
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,518
She's fine. She's all right. She's asleep.

365
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,942
We did bath time.

366
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,736
She had buttered noodles.

367
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,037
You hungry?

368
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,082
Dinner's almost ready.

369
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,417
Irish stew.

370
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,960
[screams] Fuck!

371
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,010
I haven't had a drink today. Come on.

372
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,012
Alex.

373
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,347
I'm trying here.

374
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,141
Hey.

375
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,144
I'm not staying for dinner.
I'm getting Maddy and I'm leaving.

376
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,815
I went to a meeting today.

377
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,985
Ethan took me.

378
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,530
Okay. That's...

379
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,574
Could you please sit?

380
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,994
- All right. Let's make a fucking mess!
- [Maddy crying]

381
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,622
Fuck!

382
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,840
You need to eat.

383
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,095
Come on.

384
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,369
I'm surprised Maddy was at your mom's.

385
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,872
Is Paula finally on meds, or...?

386
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,503
She was only supposed to be there
a couple of hours.

387
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,255
You know how much I love Paula.

388
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,635
I do, but... leaving Maddy with her?

389
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,430
I thought we had an agreement.

390
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,230
My mom's good with her
for short periods of time.

391
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,025
They, um... dance around
or do art projects.

392
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,696
She was alone when I got there.

393
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:15,618
Playing with a vape
and watching a cage match on TV.

394
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,123
Mm.

395
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,542
Where were you? Nobody could find you.

396
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,546
I got a job on Fisher Island,
and I didn't have service.

397
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,422
A job?

398
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,845
How are you gonna work?
Who's gonna watch Maddy?

399
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,304
Not your mom.

400
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,349
I'll figure it out.
It's my business, Sean, okay?

401
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,976
[Sean] Hmm.

402
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,524
Could you eat a little?

403
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,029
You're hurting my feelings.

404
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,916
I'm not eating your fucking stew, okay?

405
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,627
Stop asking.

406
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,505
All right.

407
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,342
You're officially freaking me out.

408
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,095
Going AWOL in the middle of the night?

409
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,975
Leaving my child in a dangerous
situation with a batshit crazy person?

410
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,852
I mean, are you feeling okay?

411
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,940
- That's not funny. Don't do that.
- What?

412
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,653
I'm not insane. You're the one
that woke me up in a rage

413
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,156
over some dirty dishes
and punched a hole in the wall.

414
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,325
I drank too much. I went too far.

415
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
I went too far, I'm sorry.

416
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,456
I picked glass
out of Maddy's hair last night.

417
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,084
I didn't mean for it to be
that close to her.

418
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,587
Hey, I would never hurt her,
you know that.

419
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,881
I don't know that.

420
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,966
You serious right now?

421
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,552
Okay, what's the plan here?

422
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,681
Where are you gonna go? Hmm?

423
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,226
I pay all the bills.

424
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,771
Let you hang out with my friends,

425
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:11,067
I let you move into my trailer,
you drink my beer, eat my food.

426
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,985
I let you mooch off me.

427
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,155
I do everything for you.

428
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,200
If you walk out of here,
you'll have no one.

429
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,163
I know. I'm well aware of how
completely alone and fucked I am.

430
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,250
But I won't pick glass out of Maddy's
hair again. Not gonna happen.

431
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,919
Hey, where are you going?

432
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,673
- Hey. Hey, Maddy, sweetie.
- Daddy.

433
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,258
Daddy's right here, okay?

434
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,926
Where are you going, Alex?

435
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,553
What's the plan here?

436
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,472
Okay, why don't you think
for just one second?

437
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,851
Would you please look at me? Alex?

438
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,435
Why don't you come back inside?

439
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,105
- We can talk about this.
- There you go, honey. It's okay.

440
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,565
Where are you gonna go?

441
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,400
Hey, you can't steal my kid!

442
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,112
Sweetie, Daddy's right here, okay?
Where are you gonna go?

443
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,238
[engine starting]

444
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,531
Hey! Alex!

445
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,407
Alex!

446
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,039
[dramatic music playing]

447
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,467
[Maddy] "Shoop."

448
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,970
"Shoop," Mommy.

449
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,224
["Shoop" playing over stereo]

450
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,228
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. I need a second, all right?

451
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,064
- Home.
- We can't go home right now, okay?

452
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,816
[cell phone ringing]

453
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,944
Look, Mommy, look.

454
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,238
I'm gonna take this real quick.

455
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,074
Yolanda, the Dyson, I know.

456
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,870
- Regina's not happy with your cleaning.
- What?

457
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,498
She called and said you did a crap job
on the furniture, left streaks.

458
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,251
<i>- Go back, and do it right.</i>
- Window, Mommy!

459
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,378
- Yes, honey.
- Mommy.

460
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,505
Okay, okay, hold on. I'm gonna...

461
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,052
Nope, I can't. I'm in Port Hampstead,
and I have my daughter with me.

462
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,056
Not my problem. You want this job?
You wanna get paid? Go back.

463
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,476
- It's a 45-minute ferry each way.
- Then you better get cracking.

464
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,686
You're flying. [giggling]

465
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,772
- Hold on, all right?
- Look, Mommy.

466
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,066
We don't have time for this, Maddy.

467
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,404
Schmariel! [screaming]

468
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,283
We'll go back and get Schmariel.
We're gonna get Schmariel later.

469
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,202
- I'm getting Schmariel now.
- Schmariel!

470
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,871
I'm getting her right now.
Okay. All right.

471
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,206
Okay.

472
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,835
[horns honking]

473
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,359
[laughing]

[screaming]

476
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,045
Are you okay?

477
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,345
You okay? You okay?

478
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,639
You're okay. You're okay.

479
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,518
Jesus Christ! She was in there?

480
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,023
Yes, my daughter was fucking in the car!
She was in there, you fucking moron!

481
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,902
You hit my fucking car.
You could have killed my daughter.

482
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,448
Get the fuck away from me!

483
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,199
We live in here, you dipshit!

484
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,951
[siren wailing]

485
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,085
Oh, you're so good.

486
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,338
And then shine the light.

487
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,590
Yeah.

488
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,554
Here you go, ma'am.

489
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,356
- You're giving me a ticket?
- Parking in the meridian is illegal.

490
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,027
I can't pay for this.

491
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,072
If you have any personal items
you'd like to retrieve from the car

492
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,366
before the tow truck gets here,
now is your time.

493
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,619
And who pays for the tow truck?

494
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,332
You have someone who can pick you up?

495
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,341
If you don't have anybody to call,
we can drop you at home.

496
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,594
Um, no, no, no. I've got...
I've got somebody. Thank you so much.

497
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,347
Can you make the call now?
I gotta clear the meridian.

498
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,808
- You can't stay here. All right.
- Got it.

499
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,770
[pensive music playing]

500
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,066
Were you speeding at the time?

501
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,005
[line ringing]

502
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,281
Hey.

503
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,558
[Hank] She's out like a light.

504
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,274
Last time I saw her,
she was still in diapers.

505
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,611
I would like to see her
more than I get to.

506
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,326
So where to? Port Hampstead?

507
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,079
Sean still in that single-wide?

508
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,748
No, we're, um...

509
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,668
We're not gonna go home.

510
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,631
Oh. Okay.

511
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,341
Where to, then?

512
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,639
I mean, I'd invite you back to my house...

513
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,518
but it's a school night,
and Charlene and the kids...

514
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,811
No, yeah. Of course.

515
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,311
Maybe, um...

516
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,941
Would you mind just dropping us
at the ferry station?

517
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,401
I'll have my friend pick us up.

518
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,784
What were you thinking
pulled over like that?

519
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,246
It's just that's...
a reckless thing to do.

520
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,708
Reminds me of your mother.

521
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,467
Can we just not talk?

522
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,846
Okay.

523
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,651
Would you mind pulling over real quick
and let me run to the dollar store?

524
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,947
[bell chimes]

525
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,596
[pensive music playing]

526
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,062
Thanks.

527
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,011
Let's put you down. There you go.

528
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,307
You, uh... You need anything else

529
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,433
from your old pop?

530
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,519
We're all set, thanks again.

531
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,771
Bye-bye, honey bee.

532
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,371
Boat.

533
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,793
No, not tonight.
We're just gonna get a little rest in.

534
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,800
Wait, wait. Come here, baby girl.

535
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,161
- This was in my shoe.
- What's in your shoe?

536
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,455
- This was in my shoe.
- What the heck?

537
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,706
What the heck?

538
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:54,835
Okay.

539
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,423
I put it in my shoe.

540
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,135
You're fixing my earrings, all right?

541
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,308
How do we unclip this?

542
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,100
Well...

543
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,316
Okey-dokey. I got you a surprise.
You wanna see a surprise?

544
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,110
[growls playfully]

545
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,570
Okay.

546
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,742
Ta-da!

547
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,203
We got Schmariel.

548
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,455
All better.

549
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,713
[humming]

550
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,321
