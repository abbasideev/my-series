I'm a survivor of domestic violence.

21
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,021
[all] Hi, Denise.

22
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,148
Hi, Denise.

23
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:52,320
Does anyone want to share anything today
before we start with our special activity?

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,408
Okay. Then I'll turn this over to Alex.

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,701
Let's give her a warm welcome.

00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,995

Thanks, guys.

28
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,626
I'm Alex and I am a survivor
of domestic violence.

29
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,878
[all] Hi, Alex.

30
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,966
I asked Denise
if I could do some volunteer work and...

31
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,094
I meant cleaning the toilets, but...

32
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,138
Denise said that I should do this instead

33
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,351
and I said "no," and she said "yes,"
and here we are.

34
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,645
Show them your serial-killer notebook.

35
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,398
She says my writing looks like
a serial killer's, so...

36
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,191
Damn, you wrote all that?

37
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,320
I did. Yes. I wrote this just
since I've been at McMullen House.

38
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,617
Do any of you guys write for fun?

39
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,914
Brandi, you do not need
to raise your hand.

40
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,711
I had a diary in 5th grade.
It was furry and pink.

41
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,046
It had a little lock on it.

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,591
- Yeah. Me too. I had one of those.
- Mm.

43
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,719
[Alex] Here's the hard question.

44
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,222
Who were you writing to when you wrote?

45
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,850
Nobody. Just myself.

46
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,268
Yeah, same.

47
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,273
Writing is where I go to be honest
about how I feel.

48
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,861
Sometimes it's really the only way for me
to know what it is that I'm feeling.

49
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,364
Like I have to write
in order to see what I'm gonna write.

50
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,241
If that makes any sense.

51
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,075
But...

52
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,498
I find that it's a lot easier to write
the truth than it is to say it out loud.

53
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,628
Nobody can take writing away from you.

54
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:36,633
Nobody can tell you that you're wrong,
or your words are wrong.

55
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,051
Because they're not.

56
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,845
You're right,
and your words are fucking right.

57
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,932
Because they're yours.

58
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,062
Anyway, we all have notebooks and pens.

59
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,607
Are we gonna read this out loud?

60
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,194
You can if you want to, but you definitely
don't have to if you don't want to.

61
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,948
Okay, so I brought some writing prompts

62
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,534
that I got from a real professor
from the Internet

63
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,412
that is qualified to be teaching things.

64
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,166
Okay. Describe a day in your life
that you were really happy.

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,127
It can be a real day
that actually happened.

66
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,422
Or an imagined day
that you wish would happen.

67
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,386
I'm gonna put ten minutes on...

68
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,846
the clock.

69
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,767
There's no pressure, we're just
writing for the sake of writing.

70
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,149
[Denise] <i>That was great.</i>

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,236
- Can I ask something? You have a minute?
- Of course.

72
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,571
I know the answer to this already,

73
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,658
but we're not allowed to have
any visitors at the shelter, are we?

74
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,119
No. I'm sorry, baby girl.

75
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,289
We can only have individual victims
and their children in shelter.

76
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,582
- Figured.
- Why?

77
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,879
Um, I just found out
that my mom's living in a car.

78
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,298
Sorry to hear that.

79
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,590
Thanks.

80
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,134
Is she a victim of DV?

81
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,931
She's a chronic victim of DV,
but she's also in complete denial

82
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,851
and delusional and unmedicated, so...

83
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,562
Is she over 55?

84
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,896
Mm-hm.

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,525
They have a program called SHARE that
puts homeless folks at senior centers,

86
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,777
but she has to enroll.

87
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,571
Yeah. Ah...

88
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,782
She really hates
everything government-oriented

89
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,995
and she's on the lam from a psych ward,
so that's not gonna work out.

90
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,495
Thank you.

91
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,291
Is there anyone else that
can look after your mom?

92
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,003
No, I've been taking care of her
since I was 6.

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,299
What would happen if you didn't?

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,269
[Paula] I think I'll do something,
I don't know,

95
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,313
something spectacular when I walk in.

96
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:06,699
They come in really strong. [laughs]
Yeah, that's a good idea, so...

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,578
Oh, shit, man.

98
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,289
- Hey, Mom.
- Alex, hey.

99
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:18,711
I thought that was you, I was just driving
home from a clean and I saw your car.

100
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,421
She's hard to miss.

101
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,967
- What are you up to out here?
- Oh, well, look at Her Majesty.

102
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,844
Spring has sprung.

103
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,722
It's gonna be a cotton-candy sunset,

104
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,309
and I'm gonna watch
every sugar-coated moment of her.

105
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,020
Looks like you were talking to the birds.

106
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,772
Oh, no, honey.

107
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:43,903
I downloaded that
dictation app onto my phone.

108
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:48,825
Because I'm giving a lecture
on the Neolithic concept

109
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,743
of the solar barge to the collective.

110
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,914
And, um,
I would write this one, but I can't.

111
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,833
Because my fucking arm's killing me.

112
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,168
Oh, where's your cast, Mom?

113
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,629
Where did your cast go?

114
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,381
Oh. [chuckles]

115
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,175
It was plastered to your wrist.
Where did it go?

116
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
Uh...

117
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,222
I had a terrible itch,
so I had Micah saw it off.

118
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,308
I have to say, it was oddly erotic.

119
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,645
Are you kidding me?
The cast has to be on for six more weeks.

120
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,689
- It's fine.
- No, that's not fine.

121
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,692
You have a severed tendon and now
your tendon is not gonna heal.

122
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:27,238
If you're gonna ruin
the cotton candy, you're gonna have to go.

123
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,285
I'm, um...

124
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,913
I'm glad that I ran into you.

125
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,543
I know that you have a great
living situation in your loft

126
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,045
with your collective, but, um...

127
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,341
I told you I'm moving to Montana.

128
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,928
What if you came with me?

129
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,141
I've got a place on campus.

130
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,934
You could hang with Maddy

131
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,647
and you could go on walks
and you could paint all day.

132
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,400
Watch Maddy start kindergarten.

133
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,822
Oh, babe, that's not me.

134
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,117
Why not?

135
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,619
Because I'm not boring.

136
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,873
I've got a big life.

137
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,751
I can't be galloping off behind you,
being a tag along.

138
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,004
No, Mom. I'm really serious.
I'm inviting you.

139
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,424
My blood's here, honey.

140
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,344
My mama's buried here.
Her mama's buried here.

141
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,262
The Langley women are here.

142
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,184
I am a Langley woman and I am going.

143
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,603
I know, baby, and that's you.

144
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,437
But, uh...

145
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,067
I can't leave.

146
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,529
Okay.

147
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,368
Go to some appointments before I leave.

148
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,204
- Like the wrist doctor.
- Hard pass.

149
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,123
I'm making you an appointment
for tomorrow, okay?

150
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,085
You're gonna meet me there.
Nod that you hear me.

151
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,175
I don't wanna have to worry
about you when I'm gone, Mom.

152
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,766
[Paula] Look at that. Cotton candy.

153
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,605
We're starting here, and then
we're gonna go over some mountains.

154
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,484
We're gonna go to Spokane,
which is a really big city.

155
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,028
Then we're gonna go over more mountains.

156
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,531
Then over some more mountains.

157
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,492
All the way to Missoula.

158
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,995
- Mm-hm.
- Right there.

159
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,621
Missoula.

160
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,705
Missoula.

161
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,668

00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,460
Honestly...

343
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,422
We've got the Flores family over here,
in the van.

344
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,966
Billy and Anna. I just love them.

345
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,845
You know, we look out for each other
and it's like a...

346
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,350
I don't know, a big sleep-out
or a drive-in movie theater.

347
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,935
We just need popcorn.

348
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,271
Why can't you take care of yourself?

349
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,359
What do you mean?
You know, I've got my cooler in here.

350
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,819
I've got my vitamins, baby.

351
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,197
Cozy blanket and my fucking good weed.

352
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,074
- I'm fine.
- You're homeless.

353
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,700
You're living in your car.

354
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,036
- Would you just stop?
- No. Please.

355
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,622
I love my car!

356
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,375
She's my cobalt bitch.

357
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,460
- We're like family.
- You're homeless, mom.

358
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,588
- Would you please just stop!
- You're homeless.

359
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,882
I'm under the stars. I'm independent.

360
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,679
And it's not all the time. I mean...

361
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,265
sometimes I stay with Micah.

362
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,309
When Alaina-May's not there.

363
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,981
- Who the fuck is Alaina-May?
- I told you. His wife.

364
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:19,820
They broke up, but she still stays there
because she's a feral dumpster fire.

365
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,822
The point is, honey, I...

366
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,370
You know, I like being a gypsy.
I like being mobile. Okay?

367
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,955
You know me. I'm scrappy.

368
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,917
I don't know. I can't afford to put you
in a motel or bring you to the shelter.

369
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,168
I don't know.

370
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,838
I am not your problem, Alexandra.

371
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,257
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not.

372
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,092
- I'm your mother.
- You're not.

373
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,260
Yes, I am!

374
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,721
I am!

375
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,849
You said you needed my help.

376
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:49,766
I do.

377
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,893
So how can I help you, madam?

378
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,980
Can you supervise a playdate
between Sean and Maddy?

379
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:58,150
He gets visitation
and a third party needs to be present.

380
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,526
Can you do that?

381
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,278
Yes, I can.

382
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,240
- At what time should I be there?
- 12:30.

383
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,783
Don't you worry.

384
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,202
I will take care of your girl.

385
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,792
- You're going to the doctor.
- Over my dead body.

386
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,753
You're going. Everything isn't all right.

387
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,214
Everything is fucking shit
and you need to be a goddamn adult.

388
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,675
Your hand looks terrible. You're going!

389
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,888
Do I get a lollipop?

390
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,934
[Maddy giggling]

391
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,776
Jesus Christ! [laughs]

392
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,820
What's that smell coming from your car?

393
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,490
- It smells like burnt turds.
- You went to the doctor.

394
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,284
Yeah, look. My finger still works.

395
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,452
Hey, pumpkin pie.

396
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,538
You ready for a playdate
with me and your daddy?

397
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,457
We're gonna have fun.

398
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,835
I've packed a snack and a change
of clothes and she's had lunch already.

399
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,546
We've got this. Hi, pumpkin.

400
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,675
Oh, I know.

401
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,637
I guess I'll wait here, because I have to.

402
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,099
Okay, Maddy. So you're gonna be
with Dad for four hours.

403
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,184
Thanks for sending the cops!

404
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,267
Very classy!

405
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,811
And then...

406
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,108
[whispering] we'll go and get an
ice cream together. Does that sound good?

407
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,318
Do you want to get ice cream? Okay.

408
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,405
- I love you so much.
- Oh!

409
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,575
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah, we're gonna have fun.

410
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,209
Get your Mad-dog.
You're about to see your daddy.

411
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,127
Hey!

412
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,131
Sean-y, you've got your Mad-dog girl here.
[laughs]

413
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,174
- [Sean] Oh!
- [Paula] Hey, Sean-y boy.

414
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,552
- She's heavy.
- [Sean] You're getting big.

415
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,137
[Paula] She's getting so big.

416
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,016
We've been swinging
and she can go so high.

417
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Mad-dog!

418
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,854
[pensive music playing]

419
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,316
Thank you for coming.

420
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,942
Of course.

421
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:10,365
I was worried about you falling
off the face of the earth like you did.

422
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,117
You look okay.

423
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,204
I am okay.

424
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,542
Good. Where's Maddy?

425
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,752
I thought maybe I'd get to see her.

426
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:29,259
She is at the domestic violence shelter
where I'm living.

427
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,637
They have a daycare
for their victims, so...

428
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,930
Oh, okay.

429
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:38,018
Well, did you, um...?
Did you order anything yet?

430
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,524
This is my second time at an emergency
shelter for abused women this year.

431
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,031
It's the second time
that Sean sent me there.

432
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,578
[clears throat]

433
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,499
Do you hear the words
coming out of my mouth?

434
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,460
Yes, I hear them.

435
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,755
And?

436
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,386
I wish you would have reached out to me.

437
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,307
Before taking my granddaughter
to a place like that.

438
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,184
You guys have a place to live.

439
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,104
I would do anything to help,
you know that.

440
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,191
I'd give you the shirt off my back,
all right?

441
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,692
But instead you make me worry.

442
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,612
You make Sean worry.

443
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,866
I've been searching
the ferry station floor

444
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,117
for you guys, Alex.

445
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,952
Okay.

446
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,580
Maybe you can help me now.

447
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,084
Because I do. I need your help.

448
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,335
Okay.

449
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,591
I filed for full custody of Maddy

450
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,885
so that I can take her
to Missoula with me.

451
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,929
And Sean is objecting to it.

452
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,806
Yeah, I know.

453
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,849
Sean told me.

454
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,767
You know...

455
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,938
Sean's not doing too good right now.

456
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,815
I don't care how Sean's doing, Dad.

457
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:12,070
My lawyer is building a case to prove
that Sean emotionally abused me.

458
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:18,451
And I have to provide evidence,
testimony from people that have seen it.

459
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,329
Dad...

460
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,210
will you testify that you saw Sean
emotionally abuse me?

461
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,006
- When would I have seen that?
- At the trailer.

462
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,551
- No. That's not what I saw.
- I saw you see it.

463
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,846
- No, Alex, that's not what I saw.
- You sat there and didn't do a thing.

464
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,849
If I saw anything,
what I saw was a young couple

465
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,684
going through a rough patch.

466
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,688
Sean is struggling
with his sobriety right now,

467
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,190
and what he needs is empathy.

468
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,444
You're walking away from him
at the exact wrong moment.

469
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,571
I can't be responsible
for Sean any more, Dad.

470
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,534
I have to do what's best for me,
and I have to do what's best for Maddy.

471
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,786
He's an alcoholic.

472
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,247
Okay? He's...

473
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,877
He's got a disease
that turns him into a monster.

474
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,047
It's the booze that's the enemy, not him.

475
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,090
Okay, is it the booze that hit Mom, then?

476
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,055
- Okay.
- Don't walk out.

477
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,556
Are you fucking kidding me? No!

478
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,600
Alex, what do you want me to say?

479
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,185
I want you to say, "Yes."

480
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,355
I want you to say,
"Yes, I did hit Mom. I'm sorry."

481
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,316
I don't remember that.

482
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,739
You've never been here for me
once in my entire life.

483
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,202
But I'm asking for you to be, right now.

484
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,712
I'm always there for you.
For you and Maddy.

485
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,796
It's just it's...

486
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,132
Then do this for me.

487
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,510
Stand up for me.

488
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,471
Help me protect Maddy.

489
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,851
Write a testimonial.

490
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,569
I can't do that.

491
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,532
[emotional music playing]

492
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,672
Then I guess we don't have much
to say to each other.

493
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,175
Can you just...?

494
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,105
[Denise] "My happiest day is the day
my daughter touched me for the first time.

495
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,941
I remember it like it was yesterday.

496
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,235
She was nine weeks old.

497
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,863
She didn't know I was in hell,

498
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,949
terrorized day and night by her father.

499
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,496
To her, I was just the warm,
nice milk lady.

500
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,042
But this one morning,
when she was nine weeks old,

501
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,172
we were napping on the floor and I woke up

502
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,257
because someone was touching me.

503
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
It was her.

504
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,389
This tiny baby hand
was holding onto my arm.

505
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,975
She was looking at me,

506
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,396
expressing unfiltered affection for me.

507
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,733
This look of trust on her face...

508
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,946
she saw me and loved me.

509
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,910
It was the happiest moment of my life.

510
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,456
That I could be that for someone."

511
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,966
[all snapping fingers]

512
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,726
Thank you, Denise.

513
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,189
You guys want to say
what images stood out to you?

514
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,107
"Unfiltered affection."

515
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,860
"Warm, nice milk lady."

516
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,281
"Terrorized day and night."

517
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,788
"Tiny hands."

518
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,002
Does anybody else want to share?

519
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,840
Trina.

520
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,968
Mine's about a girl's night out.
Is that weird?

521
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,303
- It's... No.
- [all laughing]

522
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,223
I didn't write about my kids
like you guys did.

523
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,059
It's your happy day.
You can write about whatever you want.

524
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,685
Okay.

525
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,941
"I was at the bar
with my usual wrecking crew.

526

[all laughing]

527
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,070
Liv, Amanda and Davina.

528
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,407
We were slamming drinks,
celebrating something,

529
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,950
I can't remember what.

530
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,122
But I'll admit it, I wasn't mad about
how I was looking that night.

531
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,586
Then this incredibly hot man
came up from behind. His..."

532
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,921
I'm sorry, I just have
to step out for a second.

533
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,005
- Keep reading. Thank you so much.
- [Denise] Okay.

534
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,135
[Trina] "His name was Neil.
He was dressed very nice..."

535
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,888
It's okay. It's okay.

536
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,931
Are you okay? What's going on?

537
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,392
She just got a little upset, that's all.

538
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:38,313
She had a little meltdown
and couldn't recover.

539
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,939
Isn't that right, pumpkin?

540
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,275
She just really wanted her mommy.

541
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:48,281
Um, Alex, Sean-y dropped us off,
and he wants to talk to you.

542
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,495
I'm in the middle of class.

543
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,332
Honey, you need to go talk to him.

544
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,125
Things did not go well.

545
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,714
What happened?

546
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,470
When I told her to get off the swing,
she had a tantrum. She was screaming.

547
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,559
- She never wants to get off the swings.
- I know, but I fucking couldn't handle it.

548
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,938
I... I lost my temper, and I yelled at her.

549
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,490
I haven't had a drink in 24 hours.

550
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,826
I was trying to be straight
for Maddy, and, uh...

551
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,332
I'm irritable.

552
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,085
My skin fucking crawls.

553
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,587
The sun hurts.

554
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,547
I'm just rubbed raw.

555
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,638
I was pushing Maddy on the swings.
She kept saying, "Higher, Daddy, higher."

556
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,225
And it was nice.

557
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,978
She was giggling.

558
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,524
But even then, I was still planning
my next fucking drink.

559
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,194
I was trying to find some... relief.

560
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,615
And she had the tantrum,
and I knew that if Paula wasn't there,

561
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,201
I'd have found a drink with Maddy in tow.

562
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,415
Just like my fucking mom.

563
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,089
I don't wanna do that to Maddy.

564
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,971
I'm signing over full custody to you.

565
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,641
I just called my lawyer.

566
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,568
Sorry I'm such a piece of shit.

567
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,239
You're doing right by her.

568
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,246
You can come whenever you want,
and get her stuff. I'll box it up for you.

569
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:04,959
Thanks.

570
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,045
[emotional music playing]

571
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,475
Do I have the DTs, or are you sparkly?

572
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,729
I'm sparkly.

573
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,411
[cell phone buzzing]

574
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,215
[Denise] Nice. Thanks for sharing.

575
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,466
[all snapping fingers]

576
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,305
That was so awesome.

577
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,183
"Fuck Murphy's Law." I like that line.

578
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,687
"Punched him like a boxer."
That stood out to me.

[Kyla] "The cracked nightlight."

580
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,983
Black, not blue.

581
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,902
I just loved the whole thing.

582
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,363
You're a great writer, Edith.

583
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,031
- Esther.
- [Paula] Oh. Yeah.

584
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,450
Well, I'm next, right?

585
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,369
Mom, you didn't write anything.

586
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,954
Well, I can recite it.

587
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,706
I'm a great... I'm just great at oration.

588
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,790
Mother.

589
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,376
Aww...

590
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,629
Oh, well. Okay.

591
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,509
- Will you wait outside? I'm almost done.
- Okay.

592
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,137
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.

593
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,181
- Peace out.
- You're welcome back any time, Paula.

594
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,766
Oh, thank you so much.

00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,394
[Paula] Oh! [chuckling]

597
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,477
Yeah.

598
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,731
[Paula] <i>Oh, man.</i>

599
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,151
Here's to getting out of Dodge.

600
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,485
[Paula chuckles]

601
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,072
My man Sean-y looked like shit.

602
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,869
Your dad shook a lot like that.

603
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,875
Do you want to tell me your happiest day?

604
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
What?

605
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,255
The thing we were doing in group.

606
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,800
You have a day
you remember where you were happy?

607
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,760
Oh.

608
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,766
Hands down, our first morning in Alaska.

609
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,437
We got into Anchorage
in the middle of the night,

610
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,566
and you were freezing
because I forgot your coat.

611
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,737
We left your dad's in such a panic.

612
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,118
I had this cabin for us,
and it didn't have any furniture.

613
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,078
So, uh...

614
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,333
I just dumped all the clothes
from the suitcase

615
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,377
in the middle of the floor
and made us a bed.

616
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,672
And we slept there, snuggled up.

617
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,762
The next morning,
while you were still sleeping,

618
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,722
I tiptoed outside,

619
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,016
and I just dove into the snow.

620
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,393
And I lay there,

621
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,147
and made a snow angel. [chuckles]

622
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,275
Because nobody was there
to tell me I was crazy

623
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,195
or suddenly explode on me.

624
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,656
It was just me...

625
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,784
the sun and the snow.

626
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,000
Anyway, in less than a year,
we were back here,

627
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,419
and I was broke as shit.

628
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,172
The whole trip was just dumb.

629
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,174
No, it wasn't.

630
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,550
It wasn't dumb.

631
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,012
You got me away from Dad,
and you never went back to him.

632
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,530
Uh...

633
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,864
So, uh...

634
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,539
So am I still invited to Montana?

635
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,292
You want to come?

636
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,918
Yeah.

637
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,507
Hell yeah, why not?

638
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,970
I can get a job painting murals,

639
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,514
find me a mountain man.

640
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,349
[Paula laughing]

641
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,934
Plus, Maddy needs me.

642
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,853
She's an artist like me.

643
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,980
Can you be ready by Monday?

644
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,941
[laughing] I'm ready.

645
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,526
I'm packed, baby.

646
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,404
That's the nice thing about living
in your car, you're packed.

647
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,740
I don't know if she's going
to make it to Montana,

648
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,075
I might have to sell her for parts...

649
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,330
but I could hitch a ride with you, yeah?

650
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,248
Yeah.

651
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,833
- Yeah?
- Yes.

652
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,501
- Really?
- Of course.

653
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,462
Oh, my gosh. Yes?

Come on in.

I can't, I've got Maddy back there.

696

I just wanted to come say goodbye.

697

I also have been meaning to give you this.

698

I'm not sure if I stole it
or what happened, but I had it, so...

I saw you had it on. Thanksgiving, right?

700
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,125
I'm really sorry.

701
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,794
Nah, can't blame a girl

- You too.

705

- Keep the sweater.
- No, no, I'm going to buy my own one day.

- I was. I mean...

I am. But, baby, honey,

715
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:21,093
I just have the most incredible news.

716
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,971
What?

717
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,016
Micah threw Alaina-May out.

718
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,811
He threw that feral bitch
to the curb for me.

719
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,231
And I slept in his bed
last night, in his arms.

720
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,025
And I'm telling you, honey,
there's sex and then there's...

721
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,736
Oh, my God, this was on a whole new level.

00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,284
Are you not coming?

724
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,662
Sweetie, you know, just not right now.

725
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:51,540
I mean, I... I can't leave Micah right now,

726
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,959
I mean, what's going on

it's just so powerful and...

728
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,296
It's just really...

729
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,717
I can't wait on you, Mom.

730
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,428
No, you're not.
Of course you're not going to wait on me.

731
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,721
This is your moment.

732
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:10,350
You go, baby doll, and I'll tell you what,
give me the address,

733
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,061

- I know.

Isn't it funny how these things work out?

737
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,198
I mean, as soon as I told Micah
I was leaving,

738
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,366
he realized he had feelings for me.

739
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,202
I mean, baby, it was, "Boom!"

740
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,497
And he told Alaina-May
about me and everything.

741
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,123
Just...

742
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,126

743
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,673
I'm gonna go without you.

744

Yes, you're going to go.
Of course you're going to go.

It's not mine.

You going to be okay?

- I do love you.
