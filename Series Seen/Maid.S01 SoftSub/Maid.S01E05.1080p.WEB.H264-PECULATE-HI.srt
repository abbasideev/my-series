00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,920
Will you grab my shit, please?

175
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,171
[engine starting]

176
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,257
[pensive music playing]

177
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,654
She's fine. Fever broke.

178
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,991
I'm so sorry.

179
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,950
Don't be.

180
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,579
She's asleep in the twins' room.

181
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,183
[Sharlene] There you go.

182
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,270
Thank you so much.

183
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,397
It's a peppermint mocha-chino.

184
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,399
Yeah. Uh...

185
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,444
Next time I'm gonna make sure
I put my phone on vibrate.

186
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,237
I'm really sorry about this.

187
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,698
Hey, we're happy to help. Right?

188
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,783
So happy.

189
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,535
If you want,
we can watch her again tomorrow?

190
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,164
Daycare said she couldn't come back
for another 24 hours.

191
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,834
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
put you guys out, thank you, but...

192
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,962
me and Sean will figure it out.

193
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,548
I should go ahead and get her now.

194
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,885
You know what?
She just went down like half an hour ago.

195
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,137
Just let the little lamb sleep.

196
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,642
Know what?
What are the twins doing, anyway?

197
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,436
- Rude of them not to say hi.
- No, don't worry about it.

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,981
Addison! Abigail!

199
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,608
[Hank] Hey!

200
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,152
You guys remember
your half-sister, Alex, right?

201
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,029
This is Maddy's mom.

202
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,573
Hey, guys.

203
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,494
Nice weapons.

204
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,331
Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Go on and play.

205
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,172
They're just a little shy
around strangers.

206
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,757
Not that you're a...

207
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,177
It's just... You don't come around much.

208
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,261
Yeah.

209
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,681
Not for lack of invitations.

210
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,979
Uh, when was I invited?

211
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,441
You have an open invite, you know that.

212
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,156
I guess I didn't really know that.
Yeah. Uh...

213
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,492
Thought I was unwelcome.

214
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,747
Who told you that? Your mother?

215
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,751
Yeah.

216
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,799
Yeah, yeah, I, uh... I'm misremembering.

217
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,676
I'm gonna go ahead and get Maddy,

218
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,262
but thank you guys so much for everything.

219
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,141
[woman] Yeah, no, we're out of them...

220
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,352
Hi, how many?

221
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,067
Uh, no, sorry.
This is Sean's daughter, Maddy.

222
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,736
Hi. I'm Frankie.

223
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,821
Is Sean around?

224
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,240
Yeah. In the kitchen.

225
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,324
Hold on.

226
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,545
Hey.

227
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,881
Why did you tell the daycare
to call my dad?

228
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,884
You and your mom were AWOL.

229
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,805
- How are you feeling, Mad-dog?
- So why didn't you pick her up, Sean?

230
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,059
Because I was alone behind the bar.
And we were slammed.

231
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,143
It was lunch.

232
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,772
Besides, she loves Grandpa.
Don't you, Mad?

233
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,275
- I don't want my dad watching Maddy.
- [Frankie] Behind you.

234
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,281
I don't know
why you're so weird about him.

235
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,868
Like, he seems like
a nice enough guy to me.

236
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,412
- You don't know my dad.
- Neither do you.

237
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,208
You and your mom left
when you were, what, 5?

238
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,548
Okay, Maddy needs to stay home
from daycare tomorrow and I'm working.

239
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,592
- Can you watch her?
- I can't, I'm working a double.

240
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,013
Okay, can you get somebody
to switch with you?

241
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,391
Can't she cover for you?

242
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,353
Frankie's a server,
not a bartender, and, uh...

243
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,649
Look, it's off-season.
I can't afford to miss another shift.

244
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,485
I'm gonna get fired
if I call in sick again.

245
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,404
But it's okay for me to get fired?

246
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,240
Nobody asked you to get a job.

247
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,284
Can we at least split the day?

248
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,954
- You take her until 3...
- I'm working a double.

249
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,831
Could you come in late until I...

250
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,667
I'm working a double.

251
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,378
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you working a double?

252
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,965
Just take her to your dad's.

253
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,176
A nice house, a nice wife,

254
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,346
and he wants to be a part
of Maddy's life. I don't see the big deal!

255
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,932
Okay, bye, Mad-dog, Daddy loves you!

256
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,559
Feel better.

257
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,611
Mom!

258
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,075
I don't think she's here,
'cause the car's not here.

259
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,578
Why does she always go "poof"
when we need her?

260
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,580
[giggles]

261
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,750
Hey, shall we go home,
get some cuddles in?

262
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,841
All right, let's get these mittens on.
What do you say?

263
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,010
Come here, kitty.

264
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,471
Please.

265
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,768
Very cold in here, and we've got to get
that moldy air out

266
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,144
and fresh air in.

267
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,775
[Maddy coughing]

268
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,949
Mommy.

269
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,243
Honey.

270
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,993
I know.

271
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,955
You're freezing, I'm so sorry.

when he escapes from his final foster home

281
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,275
and the young fugitive

282

[pensive music playing]

[Paula] Alex!

- [Alex] Mom?
- Alex!

289
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,115
[Baig] This one's infected.

290
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,200
Again?

291
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,869
I'll call in another round
of antibiotics for you.

292
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,914
What are your living conditions like?

293
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,919
Uh, we are in a temporary
housing apartment with a mold problem.

294
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,462
This one's infected too.

295
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,674
Why aren't the antibiotics working?

296
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,968
Because they can only do so much.

297
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,763
Are you keeping her out of daycare?

298
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,431
I have to work.

299
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,851
She needs rest, Ms. Russell.
Somewhere warm and dry.

300
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,189
Your landlord is required by law
to do everything to remove the mold.

301
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,943
I've asked, yeah.
I don't think they're gonna do anything.

302
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,654
Then you need to move.

303
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,698
I can't afford anything else.

304
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,993
Well, she needs you to do better.

305
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,372
[door opens]

306
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,048
Hello, ladies. Come on in.

307
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,428
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this.

308
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,680
Russell Family Inn. We love it, don't we?

309
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,933
- We love it.
- Hopefully just a couple of nights.

310
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,935
I'm waiting to hear back from my super.

311
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,479
You can't stay in a place with black mold.
It's toxic.

312
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,064
[Sharlene] Oh, you...

313
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,859
Give me that little dolly. Hey.

314
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,152
Oh!

315
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,530
We have got a whole sick bay
set up, do you know that?

316
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,617
We've got <i>Toy Story 2.</i>
And we've got star soup.

317
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,371
- And how about a rainbow popsicle?
- [gasps]

318
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,331
Oh, that sounds good.

319
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,041
You want to say, "Bye, Mom"?

320
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,586
I love you so much, Mad.
I'm gonna be back soon, okay?

321
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,296
[Sharlene] Say, "Bye, bye, bye."

322
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,425
I should be back around 3,
if that's okay with you.

323
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,011
Hang out for a bit. I want to talk to you.

324
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,346
Kids, let's go! Time for youth group.

325
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,267
- I do have to get to...
- One minute... for your old man.

326
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,934
Okay?

327
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,271
Go and have a seat.

328
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,065
Okay.

329
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,667
Okay. Ready?

330
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,633
- Amen.
- Amen.

331
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,716
[Hank] All right.

332
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,094
You guys have a great day.

333
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,560
The mold you see?

334
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,980
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

335
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,233
They'll have to rip out insulation,

336
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,193
pull up the carpets. The whole deal.

337
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:35,158
Uh, I... can't even wrap my mind
around that right now.

338
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,284
Look...

339
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,498
I've been thinking about you... a lot.

340
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,295
Ever since I dropped you off
at the ferry station that night. I, um...

341
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,839
should have insisted you come stay here.

342
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
That's okay.

343
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,637
Been bugging me I didn't do that.

344
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,597
Point is...

345
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,601
you can stay as long as you want.

[pensive music playing]

522
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,879
Your bed not comfortable?

523
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,089
Just getting some water.

524
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,675
And a snack.

525
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,928
Go ahead. Help yourself
to anything you want in there.

526
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,012
Don't be shy.

527
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,599
Grab me the peanut butter, will you?

528
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,439
Still eat it out of the jar?

529
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,901
What, am I supposed to put it in a dish?

530
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,116
Can I ask you a question?

531
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,161
Shoot.

532
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,498
Did I use to hide in that cupboard?

533
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,876
What cupboard?

534
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,420
That one.

535
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,924
Uh...

536
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,093
No, you couldn't have,
because I put those in when we renovated.

537
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,845
After the twins were born.

538
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,726
Was there a cupboard there before that?

539
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
No.

540
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,744
- Can I ask you another question?
- Mm-hm.

541
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,789
When Mom left...

542
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,708
why didn't I stay here with you?

543
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,923
I didn't have much choice in the matter.

544
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,301
She split with you
in the middle of the night.

545
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,763
Did you try to get me back?

546
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,561
I was afraid of your mother back then.

547
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,025
She'd have these sudden mood swings...

548
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,905
and I was really young, and she was just
a lot more than I could handle.

549
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,622
Did you worry about me?

550
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,628
Off in a sketchy commune
with Mom in Alaska?

551
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,050
Yeah. I did.

552
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,432
I should have done something about that.

553
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,267
But...

554
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,106
I think I have awesome grandpa potential.

555
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,153
If you'll let me get it right with Maddy.

556
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,499
[Luis] You were right. It's in the walls.
Black mold. Floor to ceiling.

557
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,003
We're going to take all this out.
Go down to the studs.

558
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,963
Replace it all.

559
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,047
[Alex] Okay.

560
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,051
So how long is that gonna take?

561
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,221
Weeks?

562
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,848
Or months, or...?

563
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,185
At least. Gotta go to County, get permits.

564
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,145
You've gotta get all your stuff out.

565
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,483
Is there another unit
open in this building?

566
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,905
So...?

567
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,783
Where do I live now, uh...?

568
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:23,868
Nowhere.

569
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,414
Ask your case worker. Sorry, mama.

570
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,500
You gotta move out.

571
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,678
[Alex] Are you sure?

572
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,761

575
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,227
Thank you, Dad.

576
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,647
I'll see you after work.

577
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,567
You guys did a decent job,
got rid of all that clutter.

578
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,651
Yep.

579
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,245
You took all the racks out
and scrubbed out the bottom?

580
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,664
- [Alex] Mm-hm.
- What's with the locks on the cabinets?

581
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,750
Uh, figured we could just let
the Realtor deal with that.

582
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,794
[Yolanda] Mm. Not bad, ladies!

583
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,547
All right, let's get
the Rug Doctor back in the van.

584
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,428
Don't forget to lock up.

Look at that. Put a ring on it, baby.

698
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:18,964
What?

699
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,299
We decided in Joshua Tree.

700
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,804
Oh, baby, we went on this fucking hike,
and I forgot to bring any water.

701
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,306
And the only shade that we could find

702
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:34,271
was underneath these two, entangled,
500-year-old Joshua trees

703
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:39,901
that were just growing together,
you know, reaching for each other.

704
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:45,407
And, baby, I started to cry.

705
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,869
I want to take root
with someone like that.

706
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,581
And so does he. So...

707
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,044
we stopped in Reno!

708
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,880
Like a couple of kids!

709
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,216
Howled at the moon!

710
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,594
Yeah.

711
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,725
[Paula laughing]

712
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,563
See? There.

713
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,151
I don't know what to say.

714
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,612
What do you say?

715
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:29,784
"Congratulations, Mama,
you found happiness and you deserve it."

716
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,953
Congratulations, Mom.

717
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,081
Yeah.

718
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,375
Yay, yay! Tequila!

719
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:41,212
Oh, hey. Hey. Maddy's sleeping,
so can we do quiet tequila?

720
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,922
Quiet tequila.

721
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,301
Yeah.

722
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,386
