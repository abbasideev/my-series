I fixed things by leaving.

180
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,229
[Brady] Maddy, wait up.

181
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,693
[Nate] I could, like,
talk to Brady's pre-school

182
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,988
and just see if they have
an extra spot open for Maddy.

183
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,242
- Oh, that's all right, thank you, though.
- No, honestly. They are great.

184
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,747
They do ceramics with the kids, and...

185
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,919
uh, they grow herbs,
and other pretentious things.

186
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,087
Sounds awesome.

187
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,214
No, that sounds awesome, but I, uh...

188
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,301
I get my government grant
to supplement my daycare payments.

189
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,221
And it's an intense pain in the ass,

190
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,058
so really just the most garbage
daycares want to deal with that.

191
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,141
Yeah.

192
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,023
I'll still talk to the owner of our place,
explain the situation.

193
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,401
She's a sweet old hippie, you know.

194
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,986
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:41,575
Look at us. You know, we're finally
on a playdate with our toddlers.

196
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,413
[pensive music playing]

197
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,419
Well, it was getting kind of weird
how many times you asked.

198
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,713
[Nate chuckles]

199
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,298
Oh.

200
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,553
- Ready to see your daddy?
- Yes!

201
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,808
We're meeting him at this diner,
which is wildly inconvenient for Mommy.

202
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,854
But Mommy is so accommodating
and flexible, don't you think so, Mad?

203
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,937
[Maddy] Yep.

204
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,150
Hey, how old are you about to be? Sixteen?

205
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,985
No. Three.

206
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,237
- Twenty-two?
- No. Three.

207
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,740
- Nine years old? You're turning 9.
- No!

208
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,033
- Three.
- You're turning 3?

209
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,869
Oh, my God!

210
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,787
There you go.

211
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,081
[Sean] Maddy!

212
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,542
Hey!

213
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,753
Mad-dog, hi.

214
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,630
- Look who's here.
- [Hank] How are you, buddy?

215
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,382
Got a high-five for Grandpa?

216
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,511
I got this. Stay safe.

217
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,100
You look tired, Alexandra.

218
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,270
What are you doing with Sean?

219
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,648
We go to the same meeting.

220
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,152
Sometimes we get pie afterwards.

221
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,739
Sometimes? So this is a regular thing.

222
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,910
Look, he's just going through
a tough time right now.

223
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,664
And the program's all about service,
just lending a hand.

224
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,251
I wish you'd let me help you.

225
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,673
Heard you and Maddy are staying in a van,
with your mom and her sketchy boyfriend.

226
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,634
He's her husband now, actually.

227
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,928
Yeah.

228
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,765
That sounds about right. Bye.

229
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,603
What was my dad saying to you?

230
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,147
Nice to see you too.

231
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,151
I don't like you having pie with my dad.

232
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,531
Well, sometimes we mix it up, you know.

233
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,950
We get Jell-O, pudding.

234
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,619
The occasional breakfast pastry. Hmm?

235
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,541
Will you relax?

236
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,417
All right.

237
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,338
- He was just checking on me.
- Why?

238
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,927
Part of getting sober
is talking about why you drink.

239
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,430
- And that's me?
- No, Alex.

240
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,350
Not everything in my life is about you.

241
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,189
I happen to be figuring out
some stuff with my family right now.

242
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,526
What stuff?

243
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,906
Fucked-up stuff
that I didn't remember until just now.

244
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,450
AA just shakes it all loose.

245
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,453
Tell me.

246
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,122
Okay.

247
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,957
Like, um...

248
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,088
I'd used Narcan on my mom before I was 12.

249
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,341
That my step-dad beat me with a tire iron.

250
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,136
That I dropped out of high school
and got a job

251
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,471
because my brother
was legitimately starving.

252
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,642
That, um... I've been a drunk
since I was nine.

253
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,478
Nine?

254
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,649
I'm being honest.

255
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,527
Wow.

256
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,737
Yeah.

257
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,949
Well, Hank says it's a breakthrough.

258
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,411
My dad is not the authority on reality.

259
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,249
Okay.

260
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,169
Whoa!

261
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,129
Come on, Mad-dog, let's get out of here.

262
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,464
What?

263
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,090
I just shared something with you.

264
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,807
Where am I dropping her tomorrow?

265
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,935
Are you still at your mom's?

266
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,812
Yeah, I'm looking at new places today.

267
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,734
Hey, I'm sorry.

268
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,820
I fucked up in there.

269
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,950
What you're going through
is really tough, and I get it.

270
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,244
I should have said
that you're doing great, because you are.

271
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,996
- You're doing great.
- Thanks.

272
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,710
Must be a small part of you that's,
like, "Fuck you, motherfucker.

273
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,463
For not getting sober sooner."

274
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,470
You're sober now,
and it's really great for Maddy.

275
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,266
Would have been great for us,
though, you know.

276
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,228
Just wish I'd done it sooner.

277
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,896
Me too.

278
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,695
See you Saturday.

279
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,327
[cell phone beeps]

280
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,206
Let me ask you a question.
Are you familiar with Home TBRA?

281
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,541
TBRA, can I...?

282
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,377
I'm super nice. Please help me.

283
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,462
Am I poor? Yes. Do I do drugs?

284
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,215
No.

285
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,470
[Basil] I said pass me a wrench,
not manhandle me.

286
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:58,267
[Paula] I can't help it, babe.
You've got your hands underneath my hood.

287
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,811
- [Basil] I love what's under your hood.
- [Paula laughing]

288
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,229
[Basil] Ah, look who's here.

289
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,524
- Hey, guys.
- [Paula] Ah, shit.

290
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,692
[Basil] Yeah.

291
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,527
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey.

292
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,363
- Did you get an apartment?
- Not yet.

293
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,574
But I have some really solid leads.

294
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,910
Leads? Oh, that's great.
You should get back out there.

295
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,830
- Just pound that pavement.
- What's going on with your car?

296
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,373
Fucked if I know.

297
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,752
Ran some errands and it...
The engine just backfired on me.

298
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,921
[Basil] Yeah, I think the old carbie
is out of whack.

299
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,798
The carbie?

300
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,844
Yeah, the, uh, carburetor.

301
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,347
I think that's the radiator.

302
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,891
Oh, come on, you two.

303
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,809
It's a godsend that the car broke down,

304
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:46,356
because time spent in town running errands
is time away from my husband,

305
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,901
my smoking-hot husband.

306
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,569
Hey, um...

307
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,571
Uh, uh...

308
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:58,452
Listen, honey, we've kind of got
something going on here, you know?

309
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,454
I have to dry these for work.

310
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,041
Look, babe, it's honeymoon time.

311
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,168
And every second of these first few weeks

312
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,713
are essential
to a sexually positive marriage.

313
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,508
I've got you and a kid around here.

314
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,969
You know, sometimes I just need
this to be a fuckpad.

315
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,960
- [Alex] Hi.
- [Melody] Melody.

316
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,504
- Alex, nice to meet you.
- You too, come on in.

317
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,171
Thanks.

318
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,678
It's a perfect time to tour the place.
The kids are at the farm,

319
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,305
at our sister site,
meeting a new litter of puppies.

320
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,765
[Alex] You have a sister site?

321
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,225
Well, two, actually.

322
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,311
One at the farm, and one
in residence at the Seattle Aquarium.

323
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,481
And over here, this is our gallery.

324
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,195
Every student has their own space to
display whatever it is they're working on.

325
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,656
This could be Maddy's.

326
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,368
You know, we put their art on display
as a reminder

327
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,787
that their interests
are important in this world.

328
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,039
You know, that she is important.

329
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,292
So, what do you think?

330
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,045
I, um...

331
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,967
I think that Maddy would absolutely
pee herself to come here.

332
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,012
- But I'm...
- Nate told me.

333
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,598
You have a WCCC grant, right?

334
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,225
Well, we accept WCCC on occasion.

335
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,103
Wow, you do?

336
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,983
But it only covers
half of our tuition, unfortunately.

337
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,110
So how much can you cover for a co-pay?

338
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,989
Or we have a needs-based scholarship
that we could explore.

339
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,157
To cover the rest?

340
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,409
You are a resident
of Fisher Island, right?

341
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,411
Oh, uh, no.

342
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,246
Hmm.

343
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,376
Is... Is it a deal breaker?

344
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,253
Not living in Fisher Island?

345
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,341
Well, you have to have proof of residency
of this township to receive aid, yeah.

346
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,843
Right. Um...

347
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,597
I am actually
in the process of moving, right now.

348
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,768
Could I have a few days
to see if there's any way I could get a...

349
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,269
a rental here?

350
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,522
We can hold her spot for 72 hours.

351
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,325

to commit mail fraud?

00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,111
It's perfect, Vivian.

525
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,696
Yeah, I'll take it.

526
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,196
Great.

527
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,575
You accept TBRA vouchers, right?

528
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,246
Oh, you poor thing.

529
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:00,209
- You have to navigate that program.
- You know about TBRA?

530
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,923
Yeah, I do some volunteer work
at a homeless shelter downtown,

531
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,426
and I have heard how broken the system is.

532
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,219
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:16,351
It's like having a full-time job
on top of my actual full-time job.

534
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,353
Oh, honey, I can't even imagine.

535
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,106
But I can't take TBRA vouchers.

536

We're not zoned
for an apartment back here,

537
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,488
so we actually have to
keep this... under the table.

Don't tell Uncle Sam.

539
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:37,914
I can knock... maybe 100
off the security deposit?

540
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,667
Um...

541
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,671
What about a barter?

542
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,424
I could clean for half and pay half.

543
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,718
I'm a professional maid.

544
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,641
You know, we already have Marta,
and she is like family to us.

545
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,061
So, yeah.

546
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,939
I heard you say that you're behind
in winterizing your garden,

547
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,317
and I'm also an experienced landscaper.

548
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,784
I really want my daughter to live here.

549

00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:54,058
[whispering] mermaid bath toys.
I hope she doesn't have them.

693
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,851
- She does not.
- [in normal voice] Good.

694
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,520
Great. Well, then, here.

695
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,188
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

696
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,314
She'll love that.

697
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,068
And this one, remember, Brady?

698
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,153
- Remember we got these...
- [Brady] Hats!

699
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,781
Mermaid birthday hats!

700
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,010
- Should I put one on Mommy?
- [Maddy] Yes.

701
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,412
- Yes, please.
- Okay, here we go.

702
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,747
- Here.
- Thank you.

703
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,501
- Thank you very much.
- Hold on one second. All right.

704
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,878
And how about me?

705
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,465
- That is a good look. There you go.
- Good for you? Yeah?

706
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,677
- Really good. Super strong look.
- With the beard? Well...

707
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,220
- Stop it, please.
- Yeah.

708
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,684
Uh, Maddy, do you want to play
Brady's favorite game?

709
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,729
It's Dinosaur, where you guys chase me
because you're dinosaurs.

710
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,647
[Maddy] Yes!

711
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,357
[Nate] Let's go! Come on!

712
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,275
[Alex] Get him!

713
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,443
[both laughing]

714
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,695
[Nate] Where am I going? Hey!

715
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,905
Where do I...? I don't know where to go!

716
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,032
Which way is it? Is it this way? Yeah.

717
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,702
- No!
- [Brady growls]

718
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,455
[Nate] I can't get away!

719
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,961
Are you kidding me?
I'm sitting at a table, waiting for Sean.

720
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,713
[pop music playing over speakers]

721
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,715
[Nate] Go, Brady.

722
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,634
Yeah. Cool.

723
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,803
That's so cool.

724
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,684
Can I get you some more juice?

725
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,527
[Tania] Drink your juice and be quiet.

726
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,989
Juice?

727
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,491
Where the fuck is Sean?

728
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,911
Uh, I don't know, I said 1:00.

729
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,121
- So 2:00 at the earliest.
- Thanks.

730
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,831
Can you scratch my neck, please?

731
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,167
Right there.

732
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,545
What's been going on with you guys?
It's been forever.

733
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,964
- [Ethan] Not much, just chilling.
- [Tania] And?

734
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,634
We got engaged, dick.

735
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,843
That too.

736
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,971
What? Congratulations, that's...
How did I miss that?

737
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,182
We didn't post it on social media.

738
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,644
I think it's tacky, the whole ring shot.

739
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,395
I'll do it live, for sure.

740
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,148
- Very pretty.
- Yeah.

741
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,067
He did a good job.

742
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,194
It hurt too.
I'm gonna be paying that off for years.

743
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,863
Aww. But it was worth it.

744
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,324
There he is.

745
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,076
Hey, birthday girl.

746
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,537
- Happy birthday.
- Hi.

747
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,620
Whoa!

748
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,916
That's the girl from The Swan?

749
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,418
Frankie? Yeah.

750
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,586
She's a server.

751
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,718
Sean brought a date to Maddy's birthday?

752
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,638
I don't know, Alex.

753
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,684
I gotta stay out of whatever this is
with you and Sean.

754
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,688
You know what this is with me and Sean.

755
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,024
You told me your version, okay,
and he has his.

756
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,943
I'm Switzerland.

757
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,865
No, you're not.
I see you guys hanging out all the time.

758
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,409
- You post it on Instagram.
- Yeah.

759
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,079
Sean's been Ethan's best friend
since second grade, Alex.

760
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,373
- Okay.
- I don't...

761
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,962
- Hi, how are you?
- [Nate] Who's behind there? It's Maddy.

762
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,547
[Tania] You look amazing.

763
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,264
[Nate] Hey!

764
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,142
- Hey.
- You okay?

765
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,438
Yeah, no. I was just texting my mom.
I don't know where the fuck she is.

766
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,107
No, don't worry about it.
We're having a lot of fun, so...

767
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,190
Thank you.

768
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:35,738
I was really counting on an hour
of face-painting entertainment, but...

769
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,698
Don't worry about it. They're, uh...

770
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,783
They're plenty entertained.

771
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,410
- So come join us.
- Thanks to you.

772
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,745
Well, whatever.

773
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,371
[Alex] I'll clean this up a bit.

774
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,250
- [Nate] Who's making more bubbles than me?
- I got more bubbles.

775
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,961
[Nate] You got more bubbles?
Look, there's more juice over there.

776
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,840
- Is he your new boyfriend?
- No.

777
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,843
I would never bring a date
to my child's birthday.

778
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,056
I know him. Right?

779
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,267
He's that herb that used to
bus tables at The Neptune.

780
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,271
All right. He is an engineer now,
and he's my friend.

781
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,606
He's not your friend.

782
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,650
Yes, he is.

783
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,986
He wanted to fuck you then and now.

784
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,198
Look at you blush.

785
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,451
You have no right to bring
your 9-year-old girlfriend

786
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,745
- without talking to me about it first.
- She's 20.

787
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,082
It's important who our daughter is around,

788
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,377
and these are the things I expect
to have conversations with you about.

789
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,339
- I don't remember you asking me about him.
- He's not my boyfriend.

790
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,590
[Paula laughs]

791
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,883
- Hey, Mom.
- He wants to be.

792
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,259
[Paula] I know, I'm late.

793
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,261
I missed the ferry.

794
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,932
But Grammy's here now
for the birthday girl.

795
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,477
Oh, my God,
can you believe she's 3, Sean-y?

796
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,896
Oh, shit, man, you're just adorable.

797
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,107
- Hey, Paula, come here.
- Look at this.

798
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,609
- You got some pomade going on.
- Yeah.

799
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,319
Whoo!

800
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,322
Okay. Where's the wine?

801
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,657
I need some wine.

802
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,617
Did you bring the face paint?

803
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:08,247
Can I just have a minute
to catch my breath before I clock in?

804
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,874
There's only 20 minutes left,
and it was your idea.

805
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,712
I'm sorry. Basil and I got in a fight,
and he took off.

806
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,005
What do you mean, Basil took off?

807
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:21,218
Honey, don't you have any wine?
What kind of a party doesn't have wine?

808
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,972
A child's birthday in the afternoon,
thrown by food stamps.

809
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,726
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.

810
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,227
Whatever happened is your fault

811
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,522
because you planted those ideas
in my head about him renting my house.

812
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,567
He said he couldn't even look at me

813
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,194
if I thought he was capable
of doing something like that.

814
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,696
Then, my God, he just...

815
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:46,618
He shoved me out of the RV
and drove off the lot with all my stuff.

816
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,204
That RV is your home.

817
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,249
So you're homeless now?

818
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,419
No, no, he's just blowing off some steam.

819
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,171
He'll be back in a few days. [laughs]

820
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,673
Oh, God.

821
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,966
- Sean-y, baby.
- [Sean] Yeah?

822
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,176
[Paula] I need booze.

823
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,761
[Alex] He's sober, Mom.

824
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,221
Well, he's a bartender.

825
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,099
He still knows
how to get someone booze, right?

826
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,269
Why don't I invite my girls over?
They can bring us whatever we want.

827
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,812
- No. Don't do that.
- Good idea.

828
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,732
- Yeah, Chardonnay. Chardonnay.
- I'm on it.

829
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,066
Wow.

830
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:20,985

No, you can't have your weed guy
come to my child's birthday.

about some face paint?
