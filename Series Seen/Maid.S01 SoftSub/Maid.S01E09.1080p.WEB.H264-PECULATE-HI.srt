Do I need to notify anybody

The boutique isn't open to the public.

weeks to remember my favorite color.

a cash register if everything's free?

00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,580

00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,314
[Tara] <i>You do not.
You just inform him that you're leaving.</i>

539
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,985
We'll draft up something called a notice
of relocation and serve it to him.

540
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:55,030
Once he agrees, you amend
your parenting plan. Then you're free.

541
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,866
Um, what happens if he doesn't agree?

542
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,369
[Tara] Technically he has
30 days to object to the notice.

543
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,330
If he does,
we have to go duke it out in court.

544
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,707
Okay.

545
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,294
Um, I don't exactly have 30 days,

546
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,171
because I'm supposed
to move out of the shelter on the 6th,

547
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,424
and I was hoping to go straight to Montana

548
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:17,303
because that way, I wouldn't have
to pay for an apartment here in between.

549
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,306
So I went ahead and enrolled
in a summer session

550
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,975
and put a deposit down
on housing and everything.

551
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,561
Do you anticipate Sean objecting
to the notice?

552
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,644
Yes.

553
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,982
[clears throat] Okay. Well, if he objects,

554
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,109
we drop a legal A-bomb on him.

555
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:36,280
We slap him with a no-contact order.
That's a restraining order.

556
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,990
And we move for you

557
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,118
to get immediate emergency custody
of Maddy because he's an abuser.

558
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,703
This is a safety issue.

559
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,581
- I can do that?
- Oh, yeah.

560
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,458
We can keep going.

561
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:52,421
We can file a police report, maybe even
get a child-endangerment charge.

562
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,757
We can sue him
for emotional distress and damages.

563
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,343
We can crush his soul. It just takes time.

564
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,971
The fastest way for you
to get to Missoula for the summer

565
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,349
is for him to just sign
the notice of relocation.

Well, you're wrong.

I used Basil to break me out of the jail

687
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:35,193
Plus, uh, he still lives with his ex-wife
for a bunch of fucked-up reasons.

688
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:40,156
Could we get some more
of those free chips, please? [chuckles]

689
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,493
Anyway...

690
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,288
did I tell you about the collective?

691
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,624
- No.
- I am part of this, you know,

692
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:54,337
cutting-edge group of artists, and, um...

693
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,090
- Thanks.
- Uh, you know...

694
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,635
They were all Micah's friends,
but now they're my friends too.

695
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,472
They're all painters and sculptors,

696
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,392
and we live together, we eat together...

697
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,354
- Where do you live?
- Um, they got a...

698
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,649
A loft down by the water, at Port Renfrew.

699
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,735
And they set me up in a corner unit.

700
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,362
Got a great view.
You should come check it out.

701
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:25,243
But anyway, hon, what I'm trying
to tell you is I could not be better.

702
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:29,664
Uh, you know, I do my art all day.
And I stay up late.

703
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,709
Looking at the stars.
Talking to my fellow artists.

704
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,462
- You seem really happy, Mom.
- Oh, I am, honey.

705
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:40,508
I am. I mean, this whole thing with Basil
has been a real turning point for me.

706
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,470
I'm kind of, uh...

707
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,184
I'm kind of having
one of those moments myself right now.

708
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,768
Oh, yeah?

709
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,730
Yeah. [chuckles]

710
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,899
I...

711
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,193
I think I told you this, but, um...

712
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,031
It's what I was kind of saying
about Montana.

713
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,114
Right.

714
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,284
You left Sean-y again.

715
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,497
I did. Yeah. I'm moving to Missoula.

716
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,499
Next week.

717
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,167
And...

718
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,253
I'm going to college.

719
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,841
Oh. [chuckles]

720
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:22,925
Wow.

721
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,601
Can you afford that?

722
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,604
No. [laughs]

723
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,482
Uh, no, I can't. But I, uh...

724
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:41,987
I took out a student loan. I'm still gonna
be cleaning houses when I'm not in school.

725
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,072
And I got family housing.

726
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:48,201
And then I found a day-care program
for Maddy, so...

727
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,706
Just like that.

728
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,083
Out of Dodge.

729
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,801
What do you think?

730
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,012
God, I...

731
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,681
I just couldn't be prouder.

732
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,974
Well...

733
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,020
[Paula chuckles]

734
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,230
Hey.

735
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:23,403
I get credit for teaching you
how to bend towards the light, huh?

736
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,156
I get bragging rights, okay?

737
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,868
- I get bragging rights.
- Thanks, Mom.

738
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,203
Hey. Hey, everybody.

739
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,748
- My daughter's going to college.
- Okay, Mom...

740
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,833
[laughing]

741
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:39,918
Oh, my God.

742
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,378
[Alex] <i>Where you parked?
I'll walk you to your car.</i>

743
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,799
No. I'm fine. I'm way over there, honey.

744
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,260
It's gonna be good for me.
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

745
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:51,389
- I'm fine. Just kiss Maddy for me.
- Mom, I'll walk you to your car.

746
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,808
Why are you being so damn dramatic?

747
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,147
- Can we do this again before I leave?
- Sure thing, kiddo. All right.

748
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,733
- Good night.
- Okay, weirdo.

749
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,322
What's all this in the back?

750
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,407
Just a bunch of flea-market shit,
you know?

751
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,494
Hey, that was really nice,
and thanks for the beer.

752
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,579
Tell Maddy I love her. Night.

753
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,083
