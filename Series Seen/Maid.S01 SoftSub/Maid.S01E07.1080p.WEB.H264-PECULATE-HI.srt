Value Maids! Hello!

00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,265
<i>Of course I'm at work.
I show up to work on time.</i>

00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,516
[Yolanda] <i>Which girl is this?</i>

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,853
Alex. 3450 Ardmore.

8
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,273
Okay, keep your pants on.
I'll check my phone.

9
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,490
Yep. She forgot we were coming.
Happens sometimes.

10
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,742
Okay, well, is she gonna pay me for today?

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,828
Why would she do that?
She ain't getting her house cleaned.

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,331
You're not returning my Dyson
like that, are you?

13
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,584
Yolanda, I can't afford
to get stiffed today. I can't.

14
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,169
Showing up for this cost me

15
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,463
because I had to pay for gas,
and for daycare.

16
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>- I'm not taking a loss on today.</i>
- Calm your tits.

17
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,051
Let me see what I got.

18
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,678
All right.

19
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,681
19 Glastonbury, 12 noon.

20
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,351
That's Catalina's clean, but that girl
don't wanna work.

21
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,434
Great.

22
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,687
<i>Wait. Never mind.</i>

23
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,816
<i>That's a five-hour clean.
That's gonna take you over your 30 hours.</i>

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,735
So put me over 30 hours.

25
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,863
- No, you know the rules.
<i>- So let me get this straight.</i>

26
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,324
You cap us at 30 hours,
but if a client stands us up,

27
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,661
you're not gonna compensate us
for the time and money that we've wasted?

28
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>Sorry. Rules are rules.</i>

29
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,875
Yolanda, this is bullshit! I showed up
for work and you owe me work. Fuck!

30
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,795
- Okay. Thanks for calling, mama.

Hi, can I help you?

34
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,891
Hi, ma'am, I can see that you're on
your way out, so I'm gonna be super quick.

35
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,935
You use Value Maids
cleaning service, right?

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,021
Yeah, they're coming this afternoon. Why?

37
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,899
My name is Alex, and I would
like to clean your house instead.

38
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,194
- Yeah, no thanks.
- I'll do it for $10 an hour, cash.

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,031
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

40
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,825
You get a much better clean
at a much cheaper rate,

41
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,785
and I'm gonna get some cash in hand.

42
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,997
Just call Value Maids, cancel your clean,
and I'll start right away.

43
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,876
- Okay.
- Thank you.

Hey. You don't have to knock.

61
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,472
Okay.

62
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,019
Do you want some coffee?
I just made a fresh pot.

63
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,980
- I'm gonna be in and out.
- Okay.

64
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,526
What are you looking for?

65
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,823
There's a folder my mom said she gave me
with her bank and mortgage papers in it.

66
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,869
What do you need that for?
Something wrong with your mom's house?

67
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,414
Yes. There's tenants
that are paying rent to Basil,

68
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,292
and I can't kick them out
without proof that she owns it.

69
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,836
- Can I help?
- Oh, you wanna help me, Sean?

70
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,631
Yeah. I do. And... I'm sorry.

71
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,217
I don't know how many times
I have to apologize.

72
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,386
I lost my apartment because of you.

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,140
I know.

74
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,394
It was a slip. Okay? It happens.

75
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,441
- I was in a meeting later that same day.
- I was homeless later that same day.

- And this time, my mom was too.
- I meant what I said.

You take the trailer.
I'll sleep in the car.

78
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,490
I will never live here again.

Alex, can you stop a minute? Hmm?

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,580
Hey, can we talk?

81
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,459
I worked so hard
to get a Fisher Island address,

82
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,795
so that Maddy could go to that preschool.

83
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,963
We almost lost everything because of you.

84
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,966
I'm sure that Nate was eager
to stick his address on your forms.

85
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,719
- Okay.
- I don't want her living with that guy.

86
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,390
- It's gonna confuse her.
- About what a nice guy acts like?

87

[chuckles]

88
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,103
You know, you wanted me sober.
Well, this is me sober, baby!

89
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,523
I'm a fucked-up person,
and it's gonna be messy,

90
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,983
but I'm doing this for you and Maddy.

91
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,611
- I should not have broken...
- Just do it for Maddy.

92
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,073
...into that house looking for you,
but I was looking for you.

93
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,574
- Okay.
- Alex!

94
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,912
- Look, I can't do this without you.
- Stop, just stop. Stop! Stop!

00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,871
[engine starting]

96
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,332
Okay? Otherwise, what's the fucking point?

97
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:01,254
You're the only person that really
knows me, that knows what I come from.

98
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,048
Okay? That's why we work!

99
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,757
Alex!

100
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,845
- That's why we work. Okay?
- Stop.

101
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,972
- I'm leaving.
- We're damaged the same way.

102
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,056
We're family!

103
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,919
All right, Mom, let's do this.

104
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,003
Mm.

105
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,549
Give me a second.
These places make me nauseous.

106
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,551
Mm.

107
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,970
I think you're good.

108
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,307
How did a daughter of mine
end up so square?

109
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,350
You're basically a trapezoid.

110
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,771
- A trapezoid is not a square.
- Only a square would know that.

111
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,984
This is a Chinese food menu.

112
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,111
I am sorry about that.

113
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,491
This is a lab report.

114
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,076
Urinalysis.

115
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,372
You said this was your bank
and important documents.

116
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,960
I think... this is a different folder.

117
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,926
I've got an acceptance letter
from Montana College of Fine Arts here.

118
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,555
- You kept my acceptance letter?
- [Paula] I'm your mother.

119
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,892
You were gonna be the first Langley
to go to college.

120
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,070
I'm sorry. There's nothing in here
pertaining to a mortgage.

121
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,990
Uh, she's refinanced her house
probably 40 times.

122
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,952
Is there any way that you could
just look her up in your system?

123
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,538
Do you have a license
or state-issued ID, Miss Langley?

124
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,038
[Paula] Nope.

125
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,376
- No license?
- They pull you over.

126
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,628
They look you up in that machine.

127
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,711
No.

128
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,547
No.

129
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,051
[Singh] How about a passport?
A social security card?

130
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,595
Birth certificate?

131
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,433
Her wallet and most of her stuff
is actually in an RV with her husband,

132
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,851
and he's gone missing.

133
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,939
He's just blowing off some steam.
He'll be back in a few days.

134
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,942
We just need to get a copy
of her mortgage so that we can prove

135
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,653
to the tenants in her house
that she owns her house.

136
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,531
Could you please help us out with that?

137
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:37,243
Without identification,
I can't really do anything.

138
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,326
[scoffs]

139
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:44,333
Okay, listen up here, um, Sin... Singe...

140
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,417
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,795
Singh.

142
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,964
- Singh! Hmm.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:55,845
You know, I think we can both agree
that I'm a real person sitting here.

144
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,849
I've got real skin and real hair and...

145
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,062
I don't wanna embarrass you,
but these babies are real.

146
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,564
[Paula chuckles]

147
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,610
I think you can vouch for my identity,

148
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,739
and, you know, just type
into your little screen over there

149
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,867
and pull my mortgage up. [chuckles]

150
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,493
Can't you, sweetheart?

151
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,872
[Singh] Hmm.

152
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,752
- Last four digits of your social?
- Attaboy. 5382. Whoo!

153
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,711
[Paula chuckles]

154
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,234
[keys clacking, then computer beeps]

155
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,258
- Are you sure your mortgage is with us?
- Yes.

156
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,345
- What bank is this?
- JSMB.

157
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,222
[laughing]

158
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,433
Sorry, this is not my bank!

159
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,812
Oh, Singhy, baby,
you sure are a sweetheart.

160
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,606
Thank you for your help.

161
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,358
You have a good day!

162
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,441
You too.

163
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:59,241
You act like it's my fault
that all my shit's in Basil's RV.

164
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,327
It is your fault.

165
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,872
You married an idiot that rented your
house out and now we can't live in it.

166
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,046
Well, I'll deal with it when he gets back.

167
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,925
He's not coming back, Mom.
Will you button up?

168
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,969
You know what sucks? It's your attitude.

169
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,181
I mean, look at this amazing house
that we get to live in.

170

Look, Mommy. Pie.

175
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,025
Wow.

176
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,988
This looks amazing.
Is this shepherd's pie?

177
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,072
Yeah.

178
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,575
Mm. Smells fabulous.

179
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,786
- Is this homemade?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,455
I cook on Sundays
and just freeze it for the week.

181
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,624
Throw it in after work, easy-peasy.

182
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,794
Incredible. Thank you
for picking her up, by the way.

183
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,424
Absolutely, I was already picking up
Brady, right? Sit. I'll make you a plate.

184
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,094
Salad?

185
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,221
[Alex] Yes, please.

I didn't wanna dress it yet because
I didn't want it to be wet.

188
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,985
- Do you like your salad wet?
- Yes.

189
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,989
This stuff is the best. Want some?

190
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,992
You know, balsamic vinaigrettes
are too vinegar-y.

191
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,328
But this one's just got
the perfect balance. I made it myself.

192
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,331
- Thanks.
- And I was thinking.

193
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,584
- Maybe tomorrow we'd do...

- Well, I've got to get back to work.

197
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,471
I'm doing something truly extraordinary
back there, Nathaniel,

198
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,308

is taking my brush so well.

200

201

Uh, you're aware of this?

202
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,734
Yeah. She was looking for something to do.

203
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,237
I figured, sure, make the back
of the garage more cheerful.

204
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,906
Cheerful adjacent.

205
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,329

to have a real-life artist with us here,

Yeah, sure. Thanks.

wanna go to the stables?

Brady and I will visit our pony tomorrow,

- Sure you do.

00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,024
<i>A life ending prematurely.</i>

340
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>And me? Just here
to dust the debris off both.</i>

341
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,992
<i>- For minimum wage, I get to...</i>
- [Nate] Maddy down?

342
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,579
Yep. Is Brady down?

343
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,164
Yeah.

344
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,247
Paula down?

345
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,754
No. She is night painting.

346
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,174
- Night painting.
- Which means that she has your work light

347
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,051
and she's raided your pretzels.

348
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,385
All right, Paula.

349
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,263
Oh, is she...?

350
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,642
Okay, because,
and I don't wanna pry, but...

351
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,938
I overheard that maybe there's an issue
with her house.

352
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,567
Oh, no, yeah, I sorted it out.

353
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,279
You're sure? Because,
if I can help, I'm happy to.

354
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,698
I sorted it all out, thank you.

355
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,035
Are you the only person
looking after your mom?

356
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,119
Like is your dad...?

357
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,829
My dad isn't.

358
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,124
All right. And no siblings?

359
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,335
Nope. Just me.

360
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,424
That must be tough.
I mean, being all alone with her.

361
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,096
What? No. He told me everything.
We're gonna have a blast, Sean-y.

362
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,724
Okay. That's... Oh.

363
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,646
Like, what, are your parents
happily married and normal?

364
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,439
Well, now I can't tell you.

365
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,484
Your parents are
happily married and normal.

366
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,737
Yeah, they're retired, and they live
in Newport Beach most of the year.

367
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,155
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

368
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,869
You know, I wish...
that you would let me help you.

369
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,040
You are helping me.

370
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,334
- You're helping me so much.
- Okay.

371
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:44,714
Well, let me get a sitter for Brady
and Maddy and take you out to dinner.

372
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,886
- You wanna take me to dinner?
- I do.

373
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,558
I wanna take you to a movie.
I wanna get you a corsage.

374
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,942
Nate, you're...

375
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,025
Aw...

376
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,778
Sorry.

377
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,616
You're a really, really good guy.
I mean that.

378
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,118
You are.

379
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,123
But I'm your charity case.

380
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,417
It's not charity.

381
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,171
Right? You're... You're my guest.

382
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,009
I am charity.

383
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:34,848
I am. I mean, you feed me, house me,
board me, hot-water me.

384
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,225
You are the only difference

385
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,313
between us sleeping in a bed
and sleeping on the street tonight.

386
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,569
Yeah, I just don't know
how I could go to dinner with you

387
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,906
and sit across the table from you
and share an appetizer,

388
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,617
because it's not equal between us.

389
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,997
I don't really care about that stuff.
I just...

390
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,958
I think you like me,

391
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,296
and I know I like you.

392
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,007
That's equal.

393
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,549
Right?

394
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,306
I don't think I can
be with anybody right now.

395
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,558
[vehicle approaching]

396
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,488
- Sorry, give me a second.
- You want me to come with you?

397
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,571
[Alex] That's okay.

398
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,910
[Sean] Hey!

399
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,997
I gave you this address
because I was legally obligated to.

400
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,417
- In no way was this an invitation.
- I need to talk to you. Okay?

401
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,753
- About what?
- Everything okay out here?

402
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,922
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll just be a minute.

403
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,258
Hi, sorry to disturb, man. I'm Sean.

404
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,720
Nate. We've met a number of times,
actually, most recently at Maddy's party.

405
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,348
I don't... Are you usually memorable?

406
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,933
- Sean.
- [Sean] What?

407
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,520
Um, you can go inside.
I won't be long. Thank you.

408
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,981
- I'm fine.
- Give me a holler if you need anything.

409
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,234
Oh, yeah, just give a holler,
on your trusty steed.

410
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,194
What the fuck is your problem? Stop.

411
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,988
It's great to meet you. Sean.

412
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,532
Yeah, you too, buddy. Love the tech vest.

413
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,615
What the fuck?

414
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,785
I'm so sorry.

415
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,246
Sean. Stop.

416
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,539
Jesus Christ.

417
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,125
- What are you doing? Um...
- Where's your mom?

418
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,336
She's in the back painting.
You can't come here without an invitation.

419
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,880
Okay, I think we should
show her this together.

420
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,340
Show her what?

421
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,551
This most recent activity on her mortgage.

422
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,512
I found the folder you were looking for.

423
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,097
With her mortgage stuff in it.

424
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,016
I had her PIN, so I logged on,

425
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,227
and I was gonna print it for you,
but then I saw that.

426
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,771
Paula!

427
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,275
- You back here?
- Not now!

428
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,861
- Yes, now, it's very important.
- I'm in it.

429
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,987
Mom! Mom!

430
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,074
Hey, this is pretty cool, Paula,
what are you working on?

431
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,702
It is. I'm turning
a real corner here, baby.

432
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,621
I'm going global with my ideas.

433
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,748
Yeah, lots going on. A lot of color.

434
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,625
Shit. [chuckles]

435
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,461
It's very heady stuff, Sean-y.
I don't expect you to know it.

436
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,921
But basically it's deconstructed Arachne

437
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:16,760
from Ovid's "Metamorphosis." You see?
Arachne wasn't always a spider.

438
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:21,723
She was born a human,
but a very gifted weaver.

439
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,807
Right, Sean-y?

440
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,975
I dig it.

441
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,394
It's very profound.

442
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,896
Okay. Mom.

443
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,358
Your mortgage is in default.

444
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,402
So that means that your house
is about to be in foreclosure.

445
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,697
I need to pee.

446
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,451
Is that what all those
fucking 800 calls were about?

447
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:45,330
I thought they were trying to
sign me up for some new phone plan.

448
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,667
Paula, foreclosure means the bank
takes your house away.

449
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,587
[Paula] I will deal with this later.
I'm sure it's just a big mistake.

450
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,340
[Alex] No, it's not. Your mortgage
hasn't been paid in six months.

451
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,549
[Paula] Yes, it has.

452
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,636
Basil does it.
He collects the rent from the tenants

453
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,012
and he pays the mortgage.

454
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,598
- I've seen him do it.
- I don't think that's true, Paula.

455
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,351
[Paula] It is true. I see him
write the checks for the mortgage,

456
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,687
and I see him walk to the mailbox.

457
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,774
Uh, yeah, I'm sure that he has written
some checks and walked to the mailbox,

458
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,276
but I don't think that they were
to pay your mortgage.

459
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,612
[Paula] I think this whole thing
is a big mistake.

460
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,240
I mean, maybe he doesn't use
enough postage.

461
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,659
Use enough postage?
Are you fucking kidding me?

462
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,036
- He's stealing from you.
- Okay, that's not helpful.

463
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,333
Paula, all we need to do is find Basil.
Do you have any idea where he is?

464
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:35,296
He needs to clear his head sometimes.
He goes off the grid. He is a searcher.

465
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,382
What do you know about this guy?

466
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,720
- He's not Australian.
- [Paula] Yes, he is Australian.

467
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,556
He's Australian! He's from fucking Perth!

468
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,058
- Maddy's asleep.
- Okay, you think he's from Perth.

469
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,519
Yep, but what else do we know about him?

470
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,816
This whole thing is her fault.
She has been picking on him since day one.

471
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,820
Calling him "Cilantro,"
doubting his business intentions!

472
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,364
Don't you know what that does
to a man's psyche?

473
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,616
Yes, I've been doubting
his business intentions.

474
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,618
He's getting your house
foreclosed on, Mom!

475
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,620
[Sean] Wait. Paula, where's your phone?

476
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,291
Fuck if I know, Sean!
I don't know! What are you...?

477
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,587
Do you have a family plan with him?
You can use Find My Phone.

478
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,756
God. I don't know, Sean-y, I just...

479
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,841
- I don't know...
- [Sean] You do.

480
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,010
- And there he is.
- Where?

481
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,680
Skagit, Caribou Casino.
Our boy's a gambler.

482
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,100
- I have never seen him gamble. Never.
- This isn't a good thing.

483
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,771
- Uh-uh.
- No, well, he's gambling right now.

484
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,482
Actually, my buddy Jordan works there.
I'll drive.

485
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,441
Hell yeah!

486
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,651
- Now you're talking, road trip!
- Yeah?

487
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,779
Let me get my good weed, baby. Hold on!

488
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,407
No! We're not gonna go to a casino
to confront a con man. No!

489
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,284
I feel like we're going to Burning Man,

490
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,412
but instead of Burning Man,
we're going to Basil Man!

491
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,498
[laughing]

492
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,756
He's gonna be so surprised to see me.

493
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,840
Mm.

494
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,426
Sean-y boy. Want some?

495
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,970
- Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, Paula.
- Mom, he's sober.

496
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,096
It's just pot.

497
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,974
So, kiddos, what's the plan?

498
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,645
I think I should make
some kind of grand entrance, huh?

499
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,148
Oh, no, actually,
Jordan's just gonna bring him out to us.

500
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,817
- Who's she?
- He.

501
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,444
Oh, yeah, my buddy Jordan. He works there.

502
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,323
This is all starting to make sense to me,
why I haven't heard from Basil.

503
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,785
Because, you know, they have
terrible service out there at the rez.

504
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,121
And they pump those rooms full of oxygen

505
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,958
because they want you
to lose track of time.

506
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,626
Jordan has service.

507
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,379
Oh. But I have gum.

508
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:43,925
I've got strawberry, I've got bubblegum,
I've got spearmint, lemon.

509
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,009
I'll try lemon.

510
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,053
Why do you have so much gum, Mom?

511
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,136
Oh.

512
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,682
I met the nicest guy

513
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:55,812
down by the ferry the other day,
selling gum out of the trunk of his car.

514
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,189
This is trunk gum!

515
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,900
Yeah, best kind.

516
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,360
He was a vet.

517
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,573
I think he was just so grateful

518
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,409
to have somebody sit and talk with him.

519
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,704
- And I guided him right to the light.
- How much longer?

520
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,332
- I said, "Ricardo, baby...
- Nineteen miles.

521
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,086
- ...you have to bend towards the sun."
- Nineteen miles.

522
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,589
What do you mean by that, Paula?

523
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,260
Well, you know, baby,
that's where you get your fire from,

524
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,389
is you bend towards the sun
and it lights you up inside.

525
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,057
[Sean] I never thought of it that way.

526
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,477
- Can you text him? Tell him we're here.
- [Alex] Yep.

527
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,523
Mom, remember, we don't know exactly
what we're walking into,

528
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,526
so let's stay real calm, okay?

529
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,653
Hey... [laughing]

530
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,239
Oh, my God, he's here! Look!

531
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,576
There's his RV! He is here!

532
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,046
[Sean] All right. Jordan's gonna
bring him out those doors any minute now.

533
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,256
You guys should stay put.

534
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,342
[pensive music playing]

535
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,055
Hey, Mom, Mom, what are you doing? Mom!

536
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,699
[in American accent] Fuck off! Fuck you!

537
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,099
[Paula] Stop! Don't hurt him.

538
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,161
- [Basil] What the hell, asshole?
- [Alex] Hey, Mom.

539
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,825
[Basil] I'm doing nothing wrong in there!

540
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,772
That dealer's
got no fucking sense of humor.

541
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,609
I tell one fucking off-color joke.
I've still got fucking chips on the table.

542
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,819
- Get the fuck off me!
- Hey!

543
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,075
[in Australian accent]
Paula, what are you doing here?

544
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,620
You didn't have an accent just now.
You didn't...

545
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,958
- Where's your Australian accent, Basil?
- Yeah, yeah.

546
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,876
I'm scared. That's why my voice is off.

547
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,129
These fucking ogres are terrifying me,
babe, I'm so glad you're here.

548
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,673
Are you not Australian?

549
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,594
Of course I am. I'm born in Perth, right?

550
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,722
- We've been over this a million times.
- Wait, now.

551
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,015
Okay.

552
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,478
Just tell me the truth. Please.

553
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,356
Okay? Just tell me the truth.

554
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,198
[in American accent]
I was born there, yeah. I just...

555
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:16,494
I just exaggerate the accent a little bit,
you know. I just bung it on.

556
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,289
You were so charmed by it.
And I just wanted you...

557
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,084
- Hey, where's her mortgage money?
- What money?

558
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,922
The money you collected from the tenants.
You didn't pay her mortgage.

559
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,676
Oh. [scoffs]

560
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,305
Is that what this is about?
No, no, no, that's a huge mistake.

561
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,392
Yeah, I paid it. I called the bank today
and spoke to them about...

562
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:43,604
Hey. Stop. We know you didn't pay it.
So where is it?

563
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,034
Okay, okay.

564
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,746
Okay. I can explain, all right?

565
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,624
I have a bit of a gambling problem.

566
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,336
Okay, and I've been struggling
to stay off the tables.

567
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,922
And I ran up a bit of a debt.

568
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,510
- Is the money all gone?
- See, that's why I'm back here, you know?

569
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,221
I'm trying to make this right.
I'm trying to win it back.

570
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,057
The money's all gone?

571
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,227
Yeah.

572
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,316
- I'm gonna lose my house.
- I'm so sorry, baby.

573
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,735
That house was my mother's house.

574
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,529
It is the only thing

575
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,698
anyone has ever given me

576
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,242
in my entire life.

577
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,454
I made it art.

578
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,790
Every room,

579
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,083
every wall,

580
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,375
was my art gallery.

581
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,798
It is my life.

582
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,134
It is where...

583
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,013
my best self lives.

584
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,974
You motherfucker.

585
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,728
You motherfucker!

586
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,563
I have a problem and I'll get help.

587
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,857
- Please don't leave me.
- Oh, fuck you.

588
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,694
Just get my shit out of the RV.
You get the fuck away!

589
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,654
Baby!

590
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,241
Baby, we're married, okay?
I know I'm a piece of shit, but I love...

591
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
Get the fuck off me!

592
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,576
I love you!

593
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,036
Fuck you!

594
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,579
Fuck you!

595
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,300
You okay back there, Mom?

596
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,177
Told you so.

597
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,431
- Told me what?
- No, you.

598
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,937
You're dying to say it, so just...
go ahead and say it.

599
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,649
This isn't a victory for me, Mom.

600
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,775
Yes, it is.

601
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,943
[cell phone buzzing]

602
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,909
- Hey, Nate.
- [Nate] <i>Hey.</i>

603
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,745
<i>Uh, hope you don't mind me
checking on you.</i>

604
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,873
That's very sweet of you, thank you.

605
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,000
Maddy didn't wake up, did she?

606
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,711
<i>No, she hasn't made a peep. You okay?</i>

607
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:15,506
No, yeah, we're okay.
I'll be back. I'll be back soon.

608
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,924
<i>Okay. See you soon.</i>

609
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,427
Thank you. All right, bye.

610
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,053
Must be nice.

611
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,892
- What?
- Being you.

612
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:31,772
Having a bunch of doobies all lined up
to please you all hours of the day.

613
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,316
Must be nice.

614
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:39,572
You don't even have to spread your legs.
They just pant around you anyway.

615
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,157
Stop it, Mom.

616
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,328
- You're not mad at me.
- No, I am fucking mad at you!

617
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,623
You're taking pleasure in this,
I know you are.

618
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,375
You're doing a little dance
in your heart right now.

619
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,378
Just about how fucking right
you were about Basil!

620
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,256
You're gonna go home
and write about it in your journal.

621
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,092
"I was right, I was right, I was right."

622
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,762
Well, congratulations, baby!

623
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,847
You were fucking right!

624
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,474
Fuck you!

625
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,684
Whoa, Paula, pump the brakes.

626
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,019
I wanna go home!

627
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,729
- All right.
- [Paula sobbing]

628
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,651
Give me that.

629
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,696
[Sean] Are you okay?

630
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,615
[yelling] She's fucking fine!

631
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,368
I'm fine! We're all fine!

632
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,247
I wanna go home!

633
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,791
I think I got everything.

634
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,210
The wallet is
the most important thing, right?

635
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,419
Thanks.

636
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,088
[Paula] I just wanna go home.

637
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,384
[pensive music playing]

638
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,894
It's all right, Mom.

639
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,749
Can you look up...?

640
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,168
- Sorry?
- Can you look up a gas station?

641
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,512
[Alex] There's one in a couple of miles.

642
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,519
[clears throat]

643
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,603
Sorry.

644
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,689
[Alex] Hmm?

645
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,067
I'll just make a quick stop.

646
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,653
Hey, do you have any cash?

647
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,572
No.

648
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,578
Paula, you don't have cash, do you?

649
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,204
She doesn't. Are we short?

650
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,292
No, it's fine, I'll just put
five bucks, ought to get us home.

651
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,793
I'll put it on the card.

652
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,881
I've got to pee.

653
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,947
She doesn't mean it, you know,
when she goes for your jugular like that.

654
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:32,787
My mom does the exact same thing to me,
and she goes right in with her teeth.

655
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,206
They just know how to do it.

656
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,750
[pump clicks]

657
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,346
Neither of us do that to Maddy.

658
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,185
No, we don't.

659
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,230
Nobody bites our girl.

660
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,194
[emotional music playing]

661
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,782
What the fuck am I gonna do with her?

662
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,122
She has no savings.

663
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,041
No retirement plan.

664
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,334
No insurance.

665
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,503
No job.

666
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,712
No house.

667
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,799
No way to refinance her house,

668
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,094
which has been her only source of income
for the past ten years.

669
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,849
She just became my full-time problem.

670
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
Our problem.

671
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,102
Okay?

672
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,730
We'll figure it out.

673
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,691
She's my mom, Sean.

674
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,277
We are not a "we."

675
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,029
She's Maddy's grandma.

676
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,949
We are a "we" on this.

677
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,035
We'll figure it out.

678
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,371
Okay?

679
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,042
You're not alone.

680
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,136
Let go of my hand.

681
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,138
Yep.

682
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,978
You should...

683
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,316
You should go check on your mom.

684
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,288
Hey, Mom?

685
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,751
Mom, you all right in there?

686
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,173
[toilet flushes]

687
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,117
- She's gone. She wasn't in there.
- What do you mean?

688
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,788
- I don't know where the fuck she went.
- Think she hitchhiked?

689
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:27,294
Hey. Hey, man, did you see a lady walk
by here? With like a fur coat? No?

690
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,299
[cell phone ringing]

691
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,099
Fuck.

692
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,059
Shit.

693
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,729
I know where she is. Okay.

694
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,148
- Right, you know?
- Fuck me. Yeah.

695
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,570
[tires screeching]

696
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,675
[Sean] Alex. Alex!

697
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,469
- [Paula] Motherfucker!
- [glass breaking]

698
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,888
It's my house!

699
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,849
- Mom!
- [Paula] It's my house, you...

700
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,101
- Mom, what the fuck?
- He changed the locks!

701
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,645
- Take your hand off.
- He changed the locks.

702
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,564
He's a fucking... It's my house!

703
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,609
- He moved my spare key!
- Paula, I need you to...

704
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,986
- He moved my spare key!
- [man] What the fuck?

705
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,988
Stay inside, man! Stay inside!

706
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,449
- My birdbath, Sean-y!
- [Sean] Paula, I got this.

707
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,825
[Paula] It's my...

708
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,869
[discordant dramatic music playing]

709
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,747
- This was my mama's house.
- I'm gonna put some pressure on it.

710
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,832
This is my grandmama's house.

711
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,961
- Alex, Alex! Call 911! Call 911!
- You can't do this! It's my house!

712
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,382
It's my house.

713
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,677
[voices echoing]

714
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,893
- It's my house!
- Put pressure on it. Put pressure on it.

715
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,938
[Paula] It could have been your house.

716
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,436
[doctor] We have her stabilized.

717
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,993
She cut her flexor tendon,
which caused a lot of blood loss.

718
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,914
So we're gonna prep her up
for surgery and admit her overnight.

719
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,667
Okay.

720
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,378
Is there any reason
we need to stick around?

721
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,630
[doctor] No, we're just gonna monitor...

722
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,759
Did you get any of that?
She lost a lot of blood,

723
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:43,138
and she cut something
called a flexor tendon in her wrist.

724
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:48,018
Cut it in half, so they're gonna have
to do surgery and stitches.

725
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,689
Nod that you hear me.

726
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,741
Alex.

727
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,707
They're gonna keep her overnight.

728
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,751
And there's really not anything more
we can do.

729
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,264
Nate can watch Maddy, right?

730
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,474
Alex?

731
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,189
All right. I'm gonna take you home, okay?

732
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,622
[Sean] If you want to get cleaned up.

733
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,784
[music fades]

734
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:58,982
Ladies first.

735
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,304
Maddy rode a pony today.

736
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,392
What?

737
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,482
This morning.

738
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,945
Maddy rode a real, live pony.

739
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,242
She was really, really happy.

740
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,464
[sobbing] My mom's so fucked up.

741
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,385
Hey.

742
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:11,762
Hey.

743
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,851
Hey, it's all right.

744
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,351
It's all right.

745
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,895
It's okay.

746
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,358
We knew that.

747
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,861
[Alex] Not like this.

748
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,407
She's covered in blood
and she's in a psych ward.

749
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,828
[Sean] She was scary.

750
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,292
The whole thing was really scary.

751
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,472
- Do you think that's gonna be me one day?
- No.

752
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,599
Do you think
I'm gonna scare Maddy like that?

753
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,476
No. No.

754
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,896
Alex, not a chance.

755
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,112
I'm sorry.

756
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,196
Don't be.

757
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,034
- Sorry.
- No. Don't be. It's okay.

758
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,577
I'm sorry.

759
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,829
It's all... Look, if it was my mom...

760
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,416
I'd probably be crying all over you.

761
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,753
As a matter of fact,

762
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,757
I think I snarfed all over you
when my mom relapsed.

763
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,018
[moaning]

764
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,919
- Alex.
- Please.

765
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,839
[panting]

766
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,065
- Is this what you want?
- Yes.

767
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,775
Yes.

768
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,611
Yes.
