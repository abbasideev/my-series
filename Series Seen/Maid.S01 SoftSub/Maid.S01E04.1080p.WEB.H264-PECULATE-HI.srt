00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,401
Hopefully not the triangle.

340
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,324
No, yeah, I think, uh, the vacation part.

341
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,451
[chuckling]

342
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:42,082
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm really nervous,
like, my fingernails are sweating.

343
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,502
You're so pretty.

344
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,211
Um...

345
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,131
Hi. I'm Wayne.

346
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,677
- Alex.
- The writer.

347
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,804
Yeah.

348
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,767
You smell good. I just smelled you.

349
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,811
Not on purpose.

350
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,273
Um...

351
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,861
- Do you want a drink?
- Please, God.

352
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,785
Hmm.

353
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,373
Do you want to give me a tour?

354
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,335
Uh...

355
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,254
I think you get it. Uh...

356
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,507
This is the kitchen.

357
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,302
Yes. Clean.

358
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,763
We have a really good maid.

359
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,318
So how do you like Missoula?

360
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,279
It's good.

361
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,449
Teachers are really good.

362
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,826
I just wanna write, so...

363
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,746
You know who has
a great fiction writing program?

364
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,456
The New School.

365
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,668
- You ever thought about New York?
- It's expensive.

366
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,881
Your dad can't help you out?

367
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,759
I don't take money from him.

368
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:22,932
He, uh, divorced my mom when I was 6
and became a born-again Christian,

369
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,728
and started a whole new family
that I'm not a part of.

370
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,232
What about mom? Are you close with her?

371
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,738
She's undiagnosed bipolar, so no.

372
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,532
Damn, I'm sorry.

373
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,826
I feel like a dick now.

374
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,915
My biggest complaint about my parents is,
like, they send me too many e-mails, so...

375
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,754
- Your parents pay for your school?
- No. Not my school, just my apartment.

376
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,590
They bought it for me as an investment.

377
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,802
Your parents bought you an apartment?
In Manhattan?

378
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,095
Yeah.

379
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,974
But I don't like taking money from them.

380
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,437
Being around them makes me feel...
It makes me feel lonely.

381
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:14,150
We get together twice a year, maybe,
and we just sit around on our phones,

382
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,486
waiting for the day to end.

383
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,490
How about you? Where were you today?

384
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,498
Honestly, I've spent the past few
Thanksgivings with my boyfriend.

385
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,587
He has this little niece
that comes over and, uh...

386
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,675
It's usually just the three of us.

387
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,221
But we broke up, so...

388
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,100
This is my first holiday without them.

389
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,061
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,148
Don't be.

391
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,650
This is what I wanted.

392
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,704
So, what do you...
What do you write about?

393
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,290
What do you make films about?

394
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,669
Nope, we're done talking about me.
Tell me what you're working on.

395
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:24,179
It's new, so I don't really know
how to talk about it yet.

396
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,396
It's a story about a woman.

397
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,983
I love female protagonists.

398
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,573
She lives in a big, beautiful house.

399
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,328
The kind of house
that's on the cover of magazines.

400
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,084
She has a personal trainer
and a financial adviser.

401
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,505
And an IRA.

402
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,215
[pensive music playing]

403
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,842
She's been to the Louvre more than once.

404
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,973
She spends entire Saturdays...

405
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,644
getting hot-stone massages.

406
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,898
And reading her first-edition books.

407
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,570
She has a cashmere sweater
that makes her feel like...

408
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:29,369
she's being hugged by 1000 baby lambs.

409
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:36,668
She wakes up every morning
to a view of the ocean.

410
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,088
Like it exists just for her.

411
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,381
Nice detail.

412
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,426
She has the luxury of time.

413
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,432
No long lines to stand in.

414
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,103
No time cards to punch.

415
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,861
She has time to bake
seven pies from scratch, if she wants to.

416
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,908
What's the conflict?

417
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,911
There isn't one.

418
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,378
- People with money have everything.
- That's not true.

419
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,716
I mean, I have a Peloton,
and I'm miserable.

420
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,261
- You have a Peloton?
- Do I look like I have a Peloton?

421
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,389
You look like you use it as a chair.

422
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,432
Ouch.

423
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,364
[car approaching]

424
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,448
Fuck.

425
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,076
- What?
- Fuck. Fuck!

426
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,162
- You gotta go. You gotta go.
- What?

427
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,830
Come on. Put your coat on.

428
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,250
My stepmom's here,
she hates having strangers in the house.

429
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,796
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

430
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,008
- Sheesh.
- Around there. Side of the house.

431
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,677
- Can we hang again before I...?
- No. Go! Faster, go!

432
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,803
[door closes]

433
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,437
I'm so sorry.
I was just getting out of here.

434
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,817
Oh.

435
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,236
I was here because of the grout.

436
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,089
You want another glass?

437
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,424
I'm so sorry.

438
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,592
Don't be.

439
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,304
How about some pie?

440
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,098
Want some pie?

441
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,433
No, no, no.

442
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,353
So how was your Thanksgiving?

443
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,276
It was good. I cleaned.

444
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:14,367
We eat at this table... once a year?

445
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,203
Eight grand.

446
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,208
I paid for it.
I paid for everything in this house.

447
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,003
I work so much

448
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,964
that I don't have time
to sit at this table.

449
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,635
That was always important to me,
that I kept working.

450
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,015
I was already a partner when I met James.

451
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,310
My girlfriends all said,
"Quit! Enjoy your life."

452
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,355
He wanted me to quit too.

453
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,109
But I said, "Absolutely not."

454
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,945
I wanted to respect myself.

455
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,656
I wanted him to respect me.

456
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:09,547
It's the people you think you know.
That's who you have to worry about.

457
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,050
Because you don't actually know them.

458
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,345
You know the story
you tell yourself about who they are.

459
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,390
So you can get out of bed in the morning.

460
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,146
The last few years...

461
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,108
sometimes I look at my husband...

462
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,029
he's just sitting there.

463
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,657
And he's so beautiful.

464
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,702
And it's not fair.

465
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,248
And it's maybe
what Alzheimer's feels like.

466
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,045
He's familiar, but he's a stranger.

467
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,506
And I know I love him.

468
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,593
But I don't recognize him.

469
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:05,728
And I just want this alien
to get the fuck out of my house.

470
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,484
I want the real him to come back.

471
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,957
Do you wanna know what's funny?

472
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,754
He left his wife for me
because I was young,

473
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,842
and he'd never had a good relationship
with his kids, and he wanted a do-over.

474
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:43,558
But unbeknownst to me, I had the
ovarian reserve of a 50-year-old woman.

475
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,311
You probably got pregnant
without even trying, didn't you?

476
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,980
Do you want me to respond?

477
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,775
Sure. Respond.

478
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
I got pregnant easy.

479
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,660
But I've had to bust my ass
for everything else.

480
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,495
I'm sure you have.

481
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,540
Let's see now, after...

482
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,544
five years and six rounds of IVF,

483
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,047
one of which
actually made it to nine weeks...

484
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,842
and had a heartbeat, that was thrilling.

485
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,927
After all that,

486
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,557
then there were the meditation retreats,

487
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:31,397
and even a trip to Mexico
for a Mayan uterus massage.

488
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:36,152
Three hundred thousand dollars later...

489
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,488
and now...

490
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,870
there is a woman named Joanna in Oregon...

491
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,333
who is five months pregnant with our son.

492
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
My son.

493
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:57,632
And I say that lightly
because we used a donor egg.

494
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,886
All in all,
it took three women to make this baby.

495
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,516
One with the egg, one with the womb,
and one with the money.

496
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,435
Me.

497
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,360
But she does send me pictures.

498
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,572
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

499
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,951
What am I looking at?

500
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,251
Yeah, I think that's his foot.

501
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:46,055
So then why don't I feel anything?

502
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,058
Being a mother
looks like all kinds of things.

503
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,398
I can understand
how for some women they can accept...

504
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,318
that the baby is theirs, no matter what.

505
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,281
And I really thought
I could be that woman, I...

506
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:11,289
But after all this time
and all this money...

507
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,083
when I look at that...

508
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,836
I don't feel love.

509
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,798
I don't feel loved.

510
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,303
I just feel desperate.

511
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,893
I never thought I'd do this part alone.

512
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Alone?

513
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,860
James wants a divorce.

514
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,156
I'm sorry.

00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,616
He told me
on the way to Thanksgiving dinner.

516
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:54,206
Which has got to be
some sort of record for asshole-ness.

517
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,793
It was not like I didn't see it coming.

518
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:05,092
With every miscarriage we had,
he just slipped further and further away.

519
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,011
Jesus, what am I doing?

520
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,575
- For the grout.
- No, no. Mm-mm. No.

521
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,119
It's fucking sparkling in here, Alex.

522
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,540
Don't ever let anybody
take advantage of you.

523
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:42,838
Make you feel "less than"
for all of your hard work.

524
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Work.

525
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,136
It's the one thing you can count on.

526
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,391
Everything else is fragile.

527
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,434
Okay?

528
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,647
Okay.

529
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,527
Take the pies too.

530
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,945
No.

531
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,321
Please.

532
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,287
Can I see a picture of your daughter?

533
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,455
Of course.

534
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,212
How old is she?

535
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,588
[Alex] She's almost 3.

536
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,135
And you're doing it alone?

537
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,764
Do you like being a mom?

538
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,809
I live for my daughter.

539
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,313
You can go.

540
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,611
Close the gate on your way out.

541
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,195
Okay.

542
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,823
Okay.

547
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,319
<i>And I could list them all here.</i>

548
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,323
<i>But instead, here's what I'll confess.</i>

549
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,783
<i>Cleaning people's houses means</i>

550
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,787
<i>I spend hours dusting credenzas
that could put me through college,</i>

551
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,833
<i>washing floors made of wood
that could buy me a house.</i>

552
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,339
<i>It's hard not to want
their things, their lives.</i>

553
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,300
<i>No, "want" is too soft a word. Covet.</i>

554
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,178
<i>It's hard not to covet
these lives that you ache for,</i>

555
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,681

<i>with marbled bathrooms
and floor-to-ceiling views of the sea,</i>

560

<i>their lives are still lacking.</i>

561
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,791
<i>Maybe all those long hallways and
walk-in closets are just hiding places.</i>

562
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,254
<i>Maybe all that glass
just shows you your own loneliness.</i>

563
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:36,220

you lose yourself in it.</i>

How was your Turkey Day?

574
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,118
It was good, we had cranberry sauce.
Not a fan.

575
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,079
Oh, my goodness, I missed you.
I missed you. I missed you.

576
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,414
We missed you too.

577
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:49,209
I thought maybe
you'd change your mind and come by.

578
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,756
I don't wanna confuse her
about where Mommy lives.

579

- Did she eat yet?
- Yep, scrambled eggs.

580
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,306
Thanks.

581
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:09,396
- So how was your lonely Thanksgiving?
- It was okay. Kind of nice, actually.

582

I saw you on Tinder.

- Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

Okay. Thanks.

Why don't you give your daddy
a big kiss goodbye?

See you Friday.

Bye, Maddy! Bye, Mad-dog!

- You guys have fun.

Guess what. Do you like pie? Are you sure?

591
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,182
Good news for you.

592
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,853
I have seven whole pies at home.

- [Maddy] Seven?
- Seven whole pies.
