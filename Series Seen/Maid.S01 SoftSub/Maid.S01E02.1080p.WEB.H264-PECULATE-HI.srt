[Alex] <i>I died when I was 11.</i>

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,110
My mom and I were living in Alaska
at the time.

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,822
One of her many failed attempts
at reinvention.

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,200
I fell through the ice.

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,828
I heard it crack

7
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
and watched as the water
started to pool around my ladybug boots.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,586
I remember thinking rather calmly:

9
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,797
"I'm about to disappear."

10
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,720
"There are many...

11
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,639
There are a lot of theories
about who rescued me.

12
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,641
Not that I know.

13
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,018
I blocked it all out.

14
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:05,440
Some say that it was the dog next door
who barked.

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,820
Some say my mom finally came home
and remembered that she had a daughter.

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,362
[Alex chuckles]

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,284
Some say that it was me.

18
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,370
That I punched my way through the ice.

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,663
Crawled my way out.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,876
But I'm not sure.

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,296
Maybe I never made it out of there at all.

22
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,967
Maybe I've been a ghost
all of these years."

23
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,896
And that would make sense.

24
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,191
Because none of you guys
seem to hear me at all.

25
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,946
Thank you so much for...

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,532
Uh, it's something I've been working on.

Reading sad words up there.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,542
Thank you for covering for me.

31
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,629
[chuckles] Thirteen wants another
pitcher of Bud. Six wants cheesecake.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,965
Uh, I have a question.

33
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,759
Who is that guy right there.
Do you know him?

34
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,344
Sean.

35
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,349
You don't know Sean?

36
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,976
Bartends at the Swan.

37
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,355
Would you mind going
and seeing what he's reading?

38
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,274
Are you serious?

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,449
- Can I get a pitcher of Bud for 13?
- Sure.

45
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,393
Nate.

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,355
From Neptune. From brunch?

47
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,152
Nate.

48
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,654
Uh, Nate. Right. Of course.

49
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,531
Hi. Of course I run into you.

50
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,449
Hey. Yeah.

51
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,578
I was just catching the ferry
going into work early and I was like:

52
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,873
"Whoa. That girl looks like Alex."

53
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,124
And it is.

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,210
- This must be Maddy.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,961
Recognize her from Facebook.

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,297
What are you guys doing
camped out on the floor?

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,174
- What are you, stranded?
- Ah, no.

58
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:41,179
We just got to the ferry a little early,
so we're taking a little catnap.

59
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:46,017
- What time do you have? My phone died.
- 6:05.

60
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,145
Why do you have a vacuum?

61
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,108
I'm just really
into vacuums right now, Nate.

62
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,861
Like to keep one close.

63
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,031
Okay. Well, the ferry's here,

64
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,701
so why don't I just help you out
with your stuff?

65
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,413
That's okay.
We're taking a different ferry.

66
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,665
Thank you, though.

67
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,124
It was good to see you.

68
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,835
What other ferry?

69
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,298
I'm gonna let her sleep, is all.
She's just, uh...

70
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,220
That's all I meant. She's sleepy.
I'm gonna let her sleep a little.

71
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,813
Listen, I don't have to go
into work this early.

72
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,191
Um, can I give you a ride somewhere?

73
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,110
Maybe buy us breakfast?

74
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,364
Oh. Uh, no. I'm... We're good. Yeah.

75
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,706
Come on. I got a phone charger in the car.
We'll hit Starbucks.

76
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,750
Let me help you out.

Hey, Maddy. You wanna watch <i>Frozen?</i>

79
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,345
I got it on a continuous loop
back there for my son.

80
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,306
- No.
- [Alex] Mm.

81
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,642
She's very afraid of the snow creature.
No <i>Frozen,</i> sorry.

82
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,811
Oh. Okay. Um...

83
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,857
Ah. Brady loves that part
because he's a psychopath.

84
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,945
Is he your only one?

85
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,196
Yes.

86
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,743
And his mom and I just got divorced,
so that's a hard yes.

87
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,287
I'm sorry to hear that.

88
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,871
Don't be.

89
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
It was amicable.

90
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,336
She really looks like Sean.

91
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,380
You think?

92
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,341
Yeah, I mean, that's a good thing, right?

93
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,925
Look like the great...

94
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,595

Hi.

00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,393
So you're still writing?

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Oh, yeah.

All the time.

100
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,654
Because you're so talented, I mean...

101
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,909
- You still working at Neptune?
- No, no.

102
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,244
I'm a structural engineer now.

103
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,372
Remember, I was in grad school at U-Dub?

104
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,832
Honestly, I can't even swim.
I'm just boned.

105

I would've just sunk.

106
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,295
Yeah, I joined this small firm in Seattle.

107
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,674
I mean, maybe not that small.
We just opened a second office in L.A.

Wanna say thank you?

you can shove it up your ass.

Oh. You. The Dyson thief.
Don't bring that kid in here.

- Sure you did.

No, I really did.

142
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,822
I got into a car accident on Route 20
and I totaled my car.

- Got a photo right here.
- Jesus Christ, that's your car?

I stand corrected.

145
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,413
But I still can't pay you,
if that's why you're here.

I did that cleaning, Yolanda.
I busted my ass for three hours.

I didn't stop to pee.

00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,967
I bought the supplies, paid for the gas.

152
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,304
I lost two hours of my life
going back and forth to Regina's house.

Hey, sucks for me too.

any other shift that you have left open?

- I'll take anything.
- I'll keep you in mind.

I really need this pay stub.

Ms. Russell.

349

- I'm sorry, judge, I don't understand...
- Commissioner.

350
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,814
I'm not a judge. I'm a court commissioner.
And I asked you what your plan is.

351
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,358
My plan?

352
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,822
To provide for Maddy, you removed her
from her home in the middle of the night,

353
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,242
have withheld and concealed
her whereabouts from Mr. Boyd

354
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,371
for more than 72 hours,
and have neither a home nor income.

355
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,455
What's your plan?

356
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,085
I'm figuring that out.

357
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,546
- Do you have a roof over her head?
- Yes.

358
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,215
We're currently at McMullin House.

359
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,343
That's the DV shelter.

360
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,767
Yes. We were referred there
by Social Services

361
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,644
after I told them how unsafe we were.

362
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,771
Your Honor, this is out of left field.

363
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,400
My client has never laid a hand
on this woman or his child.

364
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,528
[Jennings] Ms. Russell, did you file
a police report on the night you left?

365
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,405
No.

366
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,159
Do you have third-party witnesses
to confirm this allegation?

367
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,535
No.

368
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,371
[Jennings] Have you ever filed
a police report at any time

369
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,207
documenting the domestic abuse
of Mr. Boyd?

370
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,506
- No.
- May I throw some more legal at you?

371
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,716
Oh, yes, legal me.

372
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,553
[John] She failed to legal, legal,
which is legally legal per legal.

373
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,180
Ms. Russell, is this true?

374
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,061
You were in a car accident with Mr. Boyd's
child in the back seat unattended?

375
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,691
Yes. I was looking for her mermaid.

376
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,445
Mr. Boyd, the court grants your emergency
petition for an ex parte order

377
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,572
to return Maddy to your custody.

378
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,658
We will reconvene in seven days.
Adjourned.

380
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,248
I'm sorry. What did you decide?

381
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,835
You have seven days
until the temporary custody hearing.

382
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,670
Use that time to obtain employment

383
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,298
and create a cogent plan
to provide for Maddy.

384
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,966
Maddy stays with Sean until then?

385
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,306
You can still see her with a third-party
neutral supervisor present.

- Daddy tell you where you're going?
- Home.

392
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,206
You're gonna go home,
but just for a week, okay?

393
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,333
And then we're going back
to the pony house.

394
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,712
And I'm gonna come and do bath time
with you every single night.

395

Are you okay?

401
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,590
Those fuckers.
How long did the court say he gets her?

402
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,510
- How long?
- A week.

403
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,094
Seven days?

404
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,057
Girl, that's not bad.
I heard so much worse than that.

405
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,228
Seven... You could do seven days.
That's like seven sleeps.

406
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,451
Do you get to see her?

407

That's good, Mama.
They don't always do that, you know.

409
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,295

the first time I left Carl.

But you are a great mom.

- He didn't abuse me.

417
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,991
He punched a wall beside my head,
and I didn't do anything about it,

418
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,536
and I didn't file a report,
and I didn't call the cops.

Fuck the police report.

420
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,831
Punching a wall next to you
is emotional abuse.

Before they bite, they bark.
Before they hit you, they hit near you.

Someday I'm gonna strangle you, girl"?

00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,161
Well, damn, girl.

515
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,123
This house is clean. You're good.

516
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,544
- Thank you. Can we get out?
- Okay.

517
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,214
So you distract him, and I'll look around.

518
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,138
[woman] It's gorgeous.

519
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,397
Hello.

520
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,530
Do you have any questions?

521
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,743
Uh, it's a beautiful property.

522
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,746
Yes. So much light.

523
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,129
- These walls look solid.
- They're earthquake retro-fitted.

524
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,799
The roof goes over the whole house.

525
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,055
It doesn't cover the backyard,
if that's what you mean.

526
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,309
Well, honey,

527
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,605
it's lovely, but we're gonna have
to think it over, so...

528
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,614
Okay, so don't be mad.

529
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,326
But I saw something in her office
I had to take for you.

530
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,661
No. No.

531
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,876
- Her business card.
- No, that's not it.

532
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,630
That's just so we have her number,
so we can text her. The item's in my bag.

533
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,299
Take a look.

534
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,928
- You stole her dog.
- No.

535
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,223
She came to me, okay? She was
just chilling there in her kennel.

536
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,018
- "Hey, buddy." "Hello, friend."
- No. You can't steal the woman's dog.

537
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,730
We're not stealing her. Just showing her
the sights. We're gonna give her treats,

538
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,358
then I'll text that bitch
to bring 37.50 or we cut a paw.

539
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,652
Turn around. I'll throw him over the gate.

540
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,529
Him? Oh, no.

541
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,448
- Are you a boy? [laughs]
- It's not funny.

542
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,035
I was already in court once today.
I'm not getting in trouble for a dog.

543
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,539
- Okay, okay.
- Pull over, and I'll call this number.

544
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,500
I'll call her, and I'll say
I found your dog on the street.

545
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,961
- It's not funny.
- Sorry. It's funny.

546
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,136
Regina's on her way.
She's gonna be here in five minutes.

547
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,892
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin your dog fun.

548
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,270
I just can't get arrested right now.

549
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,647
- No. It's not that. I...
- [cell phone buzzing]

550
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,944
This is the second call.
The first was when I was in line.

551
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,446
Can you hold it?

552
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,489
- I don't want it in my hand.
- Yes.

553
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,784
- Can you press Ignore?
- Mm-hm.

554
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,370
Ignored. Done. Done.

555
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,250
It's just... His face, you know.

556
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,379
- Why don't you turn it off?
- This is what he does.

557
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,382
He says, "I love you. I wanna see my boy."

558
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,095
He's just gonna call again. Fuck it.

559
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,726
You know what the fucked-up part is?
I want him to see Max.

560
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,728
It's his son.

561

00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,778

The fuck are you calling me for, huh?

564
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,657
Oh, yeah?

565
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,499
Mr. Darcy.

Oh! Oh, thank God.

567
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,344
I don't know how he got out of his kennel.
How did you get out of your kennel?

568
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,513
Oh. Where did you find him?

569
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,100
Uh, the street. Yeah.

570
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,602
How did he get all the way over here?

571

572

But your legs are so short,
Mr. Darcy, yes.

573
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,573
- I'm glad I was able to help you.
- Oh, yes.

574

Thank you so much, truly.

575

I'm sorry?

577

Uh... I'm your maid.

578
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,174
I cleaned your house.

579
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,261
Right. You, um...

580
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,722
You passed out in the nursery.

581
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,806
You stiffed me.

Did you steal my dog?

586
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,617
My slightly insane friend borrowed your
dog for a potential hostage situation.

587
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,202
But I'm returning him to you.

588
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:07,081

Call the police, yeah. Call the police,
and I'll tell them that you're a thief.

592
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,636
You owe me $37.50.

593
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,806
Unbelievable.
I do not negotiate with criminals.

594
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,016
Pay me what you owe me.

595
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,936
I am not paying you one dime.
You didn't even come back to finish.

596
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,356
No, I did. I came back to your house.
I was on my way back to your house.

597
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,692
I got into
a horrible car accident on Route 20.

598
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,278
And my daughter and I,
we've been living in that car.

599
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,405
So we became homeless.

600
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,200
And then,
because you're a cheap motherfucker,

601
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,577
I couldn't feed her, I couldn't house her,

602
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,873
and I couldn't get her off of the floor
of the ferry station, so then...

603
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,959
this morning,
the court took her away from me.

604
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:53,961

Denise, hey, where's Danielle?

694
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,186
- Let's meet in my office to speak.
- Uh...

695
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,231
- Did you kick her out? What happened?
- No.

696
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,775
Okay, well, she's gone.
All her stuff. She's gone.

697
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,153
I apologize, baby girl.

698
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,740
Can you go on down to apartment 23,
and I'll meet you there in a sec?

699
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,823
[woman] Let's go, guys.

700
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,000
Danielle checked out. She left.

701
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,376
What do you mean?

702
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,088
She left shelter, early this morning.
That's all I can say.

703
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,465
Okay. Where'd she go?

704
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,223
Uh...

705
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,063
Denise, he strangled her.

706
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,941
This happens.

707
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,361
They go back more often than not.

708
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,909
It takes most women seven tries
before they finally leave.

709
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,911
This was Danielle's third time here.

710
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,416
It took me five tries.

of our trailer belongs to me.</i>

but it's pink velvet.</i>

714
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,615
<i>And when I moved in to Sean's,
it came with me.</i>

715
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,580
And when I told him I was pregnant...

716
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,916
he sat me down on that chair...

717
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:02,045
and he brought me a cup of mint tea...

718
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,092
and he told me that he would
hold my hand every step of the way.

719
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,430
All tenderness.

720
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,978
But then...

721
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:24,026
when I told him
that I wasn't gonna get an abortion...

722
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,740
he took the chair...

723
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:35,704
and all the rest of my belongings,
and he threw them out into the rain.

724
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:43,420
And he screamed at me,
and he told me that I was a fucking whore.

725
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:48,467
And he said that
I was ruining his bike trip

726
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,761
and that I was also ruining his life.

727
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,475
And he also said that, uh...

728
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,271
he would never forgive me.

729
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,486
And he hasn't.

730
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,114
What the fuck are you thinking?
Fucking bitch!

731
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,242
Think for a fucking second, Alex!
For a fucking second!

732
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,748
And I've been afraid of him
every day since.

733
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:25,878
Anyway...

734
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,384
Just something I'm working on right now.
