00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,345
[Sean breathing heavily]

2
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,018
Hey, no.

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,272
- I've got to get home to Maddy.
- No. Come back to bed. It's so early.

4
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,361
It's barely light out.

5
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,156
I wanna take the next ferry.
Can you drive me?

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,201
Can I cook you breakfast?

7
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,663
I'll wait in the car.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,502
[pensive music playing]

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,481
[Sean] Hey.

10
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,195
Want coffee?

11
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,909
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

12
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,537
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,257
I'll wait here.

14
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,842
For what?

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,471
You. I was gonna
take you back to the hospital.

16
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,430
That's okay.

17
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,351
There's no way I'm letting you
deal with your mom on your own.

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,273
- Grab Maddy. We'll go as a family.
- Can we meet you at the hospital?

19
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,652
That makes no sense.
I'm here now. We could take one car.

20
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,779
I need a minute, Sean.

21
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,536
You don't owe that dork anything, Alex.
You slept at home, in your bed.

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,579
Can I just...?

23
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,685
You're awake.

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,317
Well, you said
you'd be home soon, ten hours ago.

25
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,485
So yes.

26
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm sorry. I had a really weird night.

27
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,452
I saw Sean.
How hard is it to just send a text,

28
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,622
"Hey, I'm not coming home.
I'm gonna fuck my ex"?

29
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,665
Uh...

30
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,921
Something happened with my mom, actually.

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,343
She was manic, and she put her hand
through a window and severed a tendon.

32
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,011
She's in the hospital now.

33
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,431
And I'm accusing you
of being on a walk of shame.

34
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,018
- I'm really sorry.
- No, uh... I did sleep with Sean.

35
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm not gonna lie to you, and I'm sorry.

36
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,398
Oh. Uh...

37
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,780
No, you don't have to apologize to me.
It's not like we're a couple.

38
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:04,661
It's not like you sat here yesterday
and told me you couldn't be with anyone.

39
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,997
I really can't. I meant what I said.

40
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,791
- Unless it's Sean.
- No.

41
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,170
What is it about this guy?
Fucking peach fuzz.

42
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,005
Okay, he can make a drink.

43
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,967
I can make a skyscraper,
but you're going back to him.

44
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,552
I'm not, though.
No, I'm not going back to Sean.

45
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,762
You are.

46
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,847
- No, I'm not.
- Of course you are.

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,644
You were hurt, and you went to him.
You cried on him.

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,605
I just provided daycare.

49
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,779
That's really not what happened, Nate.
That's not what happened.

50
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,367
I don't wanna watch your kid for you
while you fuck Sean.

51
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,411
So...

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,082
I'm gonna have to ask you to move out.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,295
I'm not trying to be a dick.

54
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,506
I care about you.

55
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,594
I just can't do a front-row seat.

56
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,763
No.

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,767
I understand.

58
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,482
I'm gonna get Maddy,
and we'll get out of here.

59
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,861
- Alex.
- Yeah?

60
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,823
Um, keep the car.

61
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,743
No. I mean...

62
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,830
You need a car, so keep the car.

63
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,587
Thank you for being so kind.

64
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,215
That's me.

65
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,926
Mr. Kind.

66
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
[pensive music playing]

67
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
- [Alex] <i>Schmariel?</i>
- [Maddy] <i>Check.</i>

68
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,905
- Mommy's stuff?
- Check.

69
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,282
- Grammy's stuff?
- Check.

70
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,116
Kisses.

71
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,079
Check.

72
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,499
Check.

73
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,471
[Paula] What you mean to do
and what you intend to do

74
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,972
are not the same thing!

75
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,227
I cannot be held accountable
for someone else's false intention!

76
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,146
Miss Langley,
whatever you say can and will be...

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,276
[Paula] Oh, my God! You're reading me
my rights over a motherfucking scratch!

78
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,363
- Excuse me, what's happening here?
- Get that child out of here!

79
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,866
- [Sean] Okay. I'll take her outside.
- Get her out of here! I can't do her.

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,247
- Uh, I'm sorry, who are you? Sorry.
- She's a fucking bitch.

81
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,835
I'm the DCR, Designated Crisis Responder.
It might be best if you waited outside.

82
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,672
This is about intent! Intent! Intent!
She's my daughter, she'll tell you!

83
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,634
All I need is my good weed
and a fucking hairbrush.

84
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,469
I'll be right with you.

85
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,595
[groans]

86
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,603
All right, Miss Langley,
I need to ask you a couple of questions.

87
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,064
Are you taking any current medication?

88
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,870
Is she under arrest?

89
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,706
No, no,
the tenant is not pressing charges.

90
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,169
- Why were you reading her her rights?
- I'm a court-appointed DCR.

91
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,422
I was evaluating whether or not
your mother meets the criteria

92
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,091
to be placed
on an involuntary hold or not.

93
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,260
You mean, commit her?

94
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,014
She had a severe manic episode.
She's still symptomatic.

95
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,683
Pressured speech,
delusions, irrational thought.

96
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,228
She told me she thought she owned
the house that she was breaking into.

97
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,355
Oh, she does, or she did.

98
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,484
Ah, well, she also told me
that she's the goddess Aphrodite

99
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,235
and she fucks the sun.

100
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,070
She just says that stuff.

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,657
Well, your mother
has refused voluntary treatment,

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,161
so I am filing a petition to detain her.

103
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,206
She's a danger to herself and to others.

104
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,042
She would never hurt anybody.
She's harmless.

105
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,461
Well, she hurt herself, seriously.

106
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,297
Unless you wish
to provide collateral information

107
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,093
and take responsibility for her,
then this is just what we have to do.

108
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,970
What's collateral information?

109
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,933
You tell the courts why
you think she's a good-faith volunteer.

110
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,436
You give examples of things she's done
that would make you believe

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
that she would attend
an outpatient program

112
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,900
and take her prescribed medications
while in your care.

113
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,694
In my care?

114
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,446
[Renee] We can discharge her to you,

115
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,074
if you're prepared
to give that collateral.

116
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,035
Is that something you're prepared to do?

117
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,081
I have work today. And a 3-year-old.

118
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,462
She scared me last night.

119
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,300
There is an evaluation
and treatment center in Port Orchard.

120
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,472
- How long would she be there?
- Usually 14 days, sometimes 30.

121
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,933
Do I tell her, or do you?

122
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,604
Generally, we don't inform the patient
until it's actually happening.

123
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,106
More soon.

124
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,610

00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,176

<i>Did you tell them I'll take the medicine?</i>

129
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,807
<i>Because I'll take the medicine.</i>

130
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,269
<i>I'm not saying I won't.
I just wanna choose the medicine.</i>

<i>Purple Kush. And I'll go to a life coach.</i>

132

They're gonna keep you in here
a little longer, keep an eye on your hand.

[Paula] <i>Wow. Just not past dinner, okay?
Because I saw the menu, it's meatloaf.</i>

134
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,830
Whatever happened to Meat Loaf?

135
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,748
The singer.

140
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,481
<i>Took me under.</i>

141
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>Threw me and my board around.</i>

<i>But I'm like the tide, I roll back in.</i>

143
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,661
Look at me. Surf's up.

144
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:09,502
- You did that to your own hand.
- Why are you so blue? It's my hand.

145
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:15,257
<i>Plus, I can paint with this hand.
That's my truth.</i>

146
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:23,307
Baby. They don't know, baby.

Maddy!

Hi, baby girl. How are you?

154
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,121
- You didn't tell me you had people here.
- They just got here.

155

We just...
We swung by uninvited, such a clichÃ©.

156
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,669
I hope you don't mind
that I brought these.

157
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,753
No.

[sighs]

159
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,009
Sorry to hear about your mom. You okay?

160
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,303
Sounds like you saw her
at a ten out of ten.

161
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,264
- Well, she's got a DCR now. That's good.
- Yeah.

162
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,643
- Maybe she'll get the help she needs.
- All right, say goodbye to Grandpa.

163
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,895
[Maddy] Bye, Grandpa.

164
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,190
Okay, guess that's my cue.

165
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,983
Bye-bye, honey bee.

166
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,945
- Let me know how it goes tomorrow.
- I will. Thank you.

167
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,949
And we will be praying for your mom, Alex.

168
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,162
There's decades' worth of blood, sweat,
and popped blisters on those things,

169
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,290
- so take care of them.
- Gross. Will do.

170
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,167
You told him about my mom?

171
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,796
I had to. He was worried
I didn't show up this morning.

172
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,798
And why do you have his tools?

173
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,592
I'll tell you later. Come here.

174
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,678
Should we give Mommy her surprise? Yeah?

177
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,145
Surprise! We made dinner.

178
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,855
Show her, Mad.

179
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,692
- Did you write this?
- All by herself, she wrote that.

180
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:44,031
- M-O-M-M-Y.
- And you did that all by yourself?

181
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:49,411
Chili. Extra bland
and spice free, per the chef's request.

182
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,627
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,801
Hey. Come to bed.

184
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,427
I'm good out here.

185
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,973
[Sean] It's not like I'm gonna make a move
on you, Alex, we'll just sleep.

186
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,725
I like the couch. Good boundaries.

187
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,522
Well, if you're back, be back.

188
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm not back, Sean. I left for a reason.

189
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,113
I'm just staying here
until I get a place for me and Maddy.

190
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,408
- Shouldn't be too long, I've been saving.
- Copy that, commander.

191
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm quitting. That's why
Hank was dropping by with his tools.

192
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,960
- Quitting what?
- Bartending. I will become a carpenter.

193
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,213
Hank knows this guy Dwight
that's agreed to take me on.

194
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,927
- To become a carpenter?
- Yeah. I've been thinking about it a lot.

195
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,389
Talking about it in meetings,
bartending's rough on my sobriety.

196
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,726
I'm up all night,
turning down shots, getting no sleep.

197

Besides, I like working with my hands.
I like being outside.

Why are you saying nothing?

199
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,031
I'm just surprised.

200
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,992
That I don't wanna be
a piece of shit my whole life?

201
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,827
[Alex] I didn't say that.

202
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,168
It's a good gig once you get started.

203
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,005
Once you're done apprenticing,
I'll be bringing home 25 an hour

204
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,174
by the time Maddy's in the first grade.

205
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,678
That's really great, Sean.
It's gonna be good for Maddy.

206
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,181
It'll be good for all three of us.

207
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,184
Please don't factor me in.

208
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,728
Come to bed.

209
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,565
No.

210
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Come to bed.

211
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,742
No. I have three cleans tomorrow.

212
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,370
I have to see my mom during lunch,
and I need my sleep.

213
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,832
All right.

214
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,836
Guess I'll sleep alone, then.

215
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,506
Maybe naked.

216
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,261
Get the light, please.

217
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,192
Good morning, Miss Maddy.
Wanna have some fun?

218
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,780
Now grab some maracas,
and we're ready to rock.

Hi, sweetheart.

235
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,947
Why don't you transfer him to the crib?

236
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,950
That's not a thing. He doesn't transfer.

237
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,871
If I so much as breathe on him...

238
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,835

and he starts screaming like a banshee.

239

Have you tried doing it to music?
Worked great for Maddy. Can I try?

240

No, no, no. You're kidding.

this morning.

- Thank you so much for returning my call.

So departmental scholarships
are for the forthcoming academic year.

I'm afraid the one we offered you
four years ago is no longer available.

How much is the application fee?

277
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,263
No, there's no fee to re-apply.

278
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,849
You'd have to submit

Great. Upload it with your application,
and send me the e-mail confirmation.

- Good.

if you could be my nanny.

- No, probably not. I mean, read the room.

- I love you, Mom.
- No.

340
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,344
Baby, I would...

341
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,182
I would give you the skin off my bones.

342
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,769
I would drink turpentine...

343
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,065
before I would let a bunch of doctors
do this to you.

344
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,567
Mom.

345
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:39,616
Hey, hey, Mom, Mom, we have 23 minutes.
Can I please just talk to you? I love you.

346
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,243
I love you, and Maddy loves you.
So many people.

347
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,705
Please get this bitch out of here.
Just get this bitch out of here.

348
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,248
- Mother. Mom.
- No!

349
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,126
You need to go. No, sorry. Right now.

350
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,671
- Are you fucking kidding me? Mom!
- [door locks]

351
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,676
Hey, Yolanda.

352
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,929
Just swapping out a filter
for 351 Armstrong.

353
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,265
- Swapping out a filter, she says.
- Okay.

354
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,478
- Okay. Is that a problem?
- Of course not. Go ahead.

355
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,522
Help yourself to all my filters.

356
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,361
I'm having a really shitty day. So is
there something that you wanna say to me?

357
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:24,411
Just had a call from my clients
over at 19 Glastonbury.

358
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:30,166
She canceled last-minute last week,
which isn't like her.

359
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,128
And then, this week,
she didn't schedule at all.

360
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,549
So being the good businesswoman
that I am, I called her

361
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,343
and asked her,
why is she ghosting Value Maids

362
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,012
after five years of loyal service?

363
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,472
You know what she said?

364
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,142
I got stood up,
and you weren't gonna pay me.

365
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,396
You stole business from me.
Took money directly from my pocket.

366
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,023
I wasn't gonna be able
to pay for daycare, Yolanda.

367
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,569
- I told you I needed another shift.
- And I told you that I expected loyalty.

368
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,239
You're fired.
Leave your ferry pass. Get out!

369
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:10,206
And if I hear you contacting
a single one of my clients,

370
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,586
I will track you down, beat your ass
and take you to court. You hear me?

371
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,671
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

372
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,138
Can I get my last paycheck?

373
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,221
Not out yet.

374
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,726
Can I leave you my address
for when it is out?

375
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,311
You can go fuck yourself.

376
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,037
[pensive music playing]

377
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,680
[children shouting]

378
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,226
Oh, Miss Russell, your invoice.

379
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,688
I sent it home with Maddy's backpack
last week, but I don't think you saw it.

380
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,942
- I missed it. Thank you.
- Yeah.

381
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,071
There's WCCC paperwork in there too.
We need signatures from your employer.

382
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,154
You got it.

383
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,243
Also, it was ice cream day,
and we didn't want Maddy to go without.

384
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,370
We took it out of the petty cash.

385
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,248
- Oh, thank you. How much do I owe you?
- It's $6.

386
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,000
For ice cream?

387
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,795
Two scoops, and each kid
got three toppings.

388
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,423
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

389
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
- Thanks.
- Okay.

390
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,483
Fuck!

391
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,499
Uh, hi, I'm sorry,

392
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,003
you don't happen to have $3
that I could bum off of you for gas?

393
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,046
I can't get home. Sorry.

394
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,214
Um...

395
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,676
- Here.
- Thank you.

396
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,616
All right. Go.

397
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,951
No more cartoons.

398
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,621
Let's go on a hike like old times,
what do you say?

399
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,124
- We're going on a...
- Bear hunt.

400
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,419
- We're gonna catch a...
- Big one.

401
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,254
What a beautiful day.

402
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,423
- We're not scared.
- We're not scared.

403
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,051
- Oh, no, a forest.
- A forest.

404
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,679
- A big, dark forest.
- A big, dark forest.

405
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,474
Oh, no. What?

406
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,809
- We can't go over it.
- We can't go over it.

407
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,604
- We can't go under it.
- We can't go under it.

408
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,899
- [Maddy laughing]
- We're going on a...

409
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm gonna...

410
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,904
I'm gonna get you.

411
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,618
Let's jump over that one.

412
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,495
You sure can. See any fairies?

413
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,748
So...

414
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,833
[gentle music playing]

415
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,379
- [Alex] Rock.
- Rocks.

416
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,677
[Alex] Here. Right here?

417
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,228
[vehicle approaching]

418
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,902
[car door opens, then closes]

419
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,789
[door opens]

420
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,709
- [Alex] Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,254
- I saved you some ziti. Are you hungry?
- Yes.

422
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,800
So how was carpentry 101?

423
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,926
Pretty cool, actually.

424
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,263
Yeah, Dwight's a cool guy.
He's got a kid Maddy's age.

425
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,934
Hank wasn't kidding
when he said he'd be tough on me.

426
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,271
I literally can't feel my fingers
or my ass right now.

427
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,070
- So it was good.
- Yeah, yeah.

428
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,572
Good.

429
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,246
I got fired today.

430
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,874
- You?
- Yeah.

431
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,459
Oh, my.

432
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,671
Well, you've gotta let me have this.
What did you do?

433
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,341
I stole a shift,
and then I pocketed the cash.

434
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,012
You embezzled? Very juicy.

435
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,139
[Sean laughing]

436
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,350
- You've been saving up, right?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,436
You have enough until you get
something else?

438
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,855
I think so, yeah.

439
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,942
I was thinking, I'm actually gonna
try to get my own cleaning clients

440
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,570
because I still have my supplies
and my car,

441
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,907
- I can probably get a vacuum secondhand.
- Makes sense.

442
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:41,579
I just have to figure out daycare
because Yolanda took my ferry pass.

443
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,332
Oh, shit. That's goodbye, Island Friends.

444
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,795
- We can't afford ferry trips every day.
- I know, but she loves it.

445
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,172
- She loves being with you more.
- Yeah.

446
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,051
But I can't clean houses full-time
and watch Maddy.

447
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,930
Well, I'm with Dwight
Monday through Friday,

448
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,265
so who else is gonna watch her?

449
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:10,858
I need to work, Sean. So I can make
my own money so that I can be independent.

450
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,527
Okay.

451
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,821
Yeah.

452
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,157
Um...

453
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,745
Could you clean on the weekends?
I'll watch Maddy.

454
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,249
That's not gonna be enough money
with you apprenticing all week.

455
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,169
- I could pick up some shifts at the bar.
- And watch Maddy all day?

456
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,674
- You're gonna be exhausted.
- Would you relax?

457
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,093
It's fine.

458
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,303
Worst-case scenario,

459
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,223
- Hank and Sharlene can watch Maddy.
- No.

460
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,184
Hank cannot watch Maddy.
That's not an option.

461
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,355
- What is with you and your dad?
- He's not a good guy.

462
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,777
He got me a job.
He's really sweet with Maddy.

463
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,780
He takes me to meetings.

464
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,576
I need you to listen to me, okay?

465
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,872
Just trust me and promise me
that he won't be near Maddy.

466
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:10,877
Okay. No Hank.
We'll figure it out ourselves.

467
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,547
I think we can.

468
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,426
Okay.

469
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,598
[emotional music playing]

470
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,686
I love these flowers.

471
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,155
[Alex] <i>You look good, Mom.</i>

472
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,201
I brought you a lipstick.

473
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,496
I don't care if you don't talk back.

474
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,292
I'm still gonna come every day
that Sean has Maddy.

475
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,836
- [Alex] We're going on a...
- Bear hunt.

476
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,881
- We're gonna catch a...
- Big one.

477
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,341
She's been asking about you.

478
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,844
- We're going on a...
- Bear hunt.

479
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:08,100
[Alex] <i>They said that she's
artistically gifted, in her preschool.</i>

480
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,188
And I was like, "Yeah, of course."

481
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,858
She's been painting with my mom
since birth.

482
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,660
Blink if you hear me.

483
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,619
Mom.

484
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,415
- [Alex] <i>We're going on a...</i>
- [Maddy] <i>Bear hunt.</i>

485
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,001
- [Alex] <i>We're gonna catch a...</i>
- [Maddy] <i>Big one.</i>

486
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,169
I'll get you.

487
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,383
- Uh-oh, what do you see?
- Trees.

488
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,356
Can I tell you a secret?

489
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,236
<i>I applied to the writing program
in Missoula.</i>

490
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,411
<i>It's a long shot because my writing sample
is about cleaning toilets.</i>

491
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,539
And what if I did get in?

492
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,587
What if we moved there when you get out?

493
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:25,261
<i>You could paint and hang out with Maddy.</i>

494
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,765
<i>Float down that river
with some cold beers.</i>

495
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,526
When you get better,
there's so much light waiting for you.

496
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,696
<i>And so much love.</i>

497
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,623
[footsteps approaching]

498
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,918
Hey.

499
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,588
- I made you a grilled cheese.
- Thanks.

500
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,648
Are you too tired to do this?

501
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,775
[chuckles]

502
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,195
- I don't need to be awake to bartend.
- So, um...

503
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:32,828
My phone's almost out of minutes,
and we're out of milk and snacks.

504
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,414
- I have a coupon, but...
- How much?

505
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,083
Uh...

506
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,213
Well, I also need money
for gas, so, like, $50.

507
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,176
Uh, do we have to keep your phone on?
Can we just share mine?

508
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,390
I've put my number on the cleaning ads.

509
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,601
- People need to be able to call me.
- Yeah, but nobody is.

510
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,771
I mean... Right?

511
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,359
I'm trying.

512
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,948
Nobody wants weekend cleans.
Everybody wants weekdays and referrals.

513
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,077
Well, I'll have cash tonight,
and we'll figure it out. Okay?

514
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,370
[vehicle approaching]

515
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,453
Fuck.

516
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,622
What?

517
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,040
- Nah...
- What?

518
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,626
Your dad's here.

519
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,838
Stay here, okay?

520
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,763
[Hank] Hey, stranger.

521
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,391
You wanna give me a hand?

522
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,351
What's all this?

523
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,149
Oh, this is just some of Alex's stuff
from the apartment with the black mold.

524
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,485
I told her I'd go back for it
with my truck,

525
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,404
and I do what I say I'm going to do.

526
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,406
[Sean] Should have called first, Hank.

527
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,990
[Hank] Right.

528
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,867
Guilty.

529
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,162
Came to get eyes on you too.

530
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,872
Drinking again?

531
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,665
No.

532
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,796
- Haven't seen you in any of the meetings.
- I've been working a lot.

533
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:12,178
- I thought we got you out of bartending.
- I'm doing both for a while now.

534
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:17,266
Well, there's a meeting at the VFW
in half an hour, so...

535
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,479
- Come on, we can go together.
- No, thanks.

536
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,778
I've been where you're at before.
But you can't do it alone.

537
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,155
Okay, you've got to...

538
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,324
You've got to tap into something stronger.

539
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,034
You can't come by here anymore.

540
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,122
Who says? You?

541
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,831
Or her?

542
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,416
Her.

543
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,961
But I'm with her.

544
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,045
Mm.

545
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,547
Is she with you?

546
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,219
Because you're not
going to meetings any more,

547
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,054
she's got you working two jobs.

548
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,222
Doesn't seem like it.

549
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,848
You done?

550
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,311
You need to get yourself to a meeting.

551
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,117
Well, that was fun.

552
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,037
Being an asshole to somebody
without knowing why.

553
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,622
[vehicle pulling away]

554
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,721
Do you wanna wait up for me?

555
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,476
All right, I'll hurry back.

556
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,479
I'm gonna do some fucking
lightning-speed bartending.

557
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,273
Woo-hoo!

558
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,404
We're going on a...

559
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,613
Bear hunt.

560
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,615
We're going on a...

561
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,700
Bear hunt.

562
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,410
We're gonna catch a...

563
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,453
Oh, look, you found one. See it?

564
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,788
[cell phone ringing]

565
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,459
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

566
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,503
<i>Uh, who is this?</i>

567
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,588
Regina.

568
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,550
Some random girl is here from Value Maids.
I got your number from her. Where are you?

569
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,385
I got fired.

570
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,012
<i>So?</i>

571
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>I'm not loyal.</i>

572
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,182
I am home. With a newborn.

573
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,311
And this woman is totally incompetent.

574
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,564
How soon can you be here?

575
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,400
<i>I have Maddy today.</i>

576
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,902
How about tomorrow?

577
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,532
I can't afford the ferry.

578
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,912
I can offer you three shifts a week.

579
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,624
Twenty dollars an hour,
15 hours guaranteed.

580
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,418
<i>You can clean
and help me take care of Leo.</i>

581
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,005
<i>I will provide a ferry pass and supplies.</i>

582
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,088
<i>How's that?</i>

583
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,466
Yes, yes, yes.

584
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,383
Hello?

585
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,676
[call drops]

586
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,971
- Hello?
- Regina?

587
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,808
Okay, Mad.

588
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,894
We're going on a bear hunt.

589
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,480
We're going to get some phone minutes.

590
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,657
[Alex] <i>Yes, I'll be there tomorrow. Yes.</i>

591
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,034
What number is this?

592
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,245
This is Alex, sorry, I'm at a payphone.
My phone ran out of minutes.

593
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,163
What?

594
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,124
<i>I'm at a payphone,</i>

595
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,711
<i>but you can e-mail me the ferry pass
and I can print it out at the library.</i>

596
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,799
What's your e-mail?

597
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,640
Hi, Magda, how's it going?

598
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,808
Sign in here?

599
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,476
Wait here, please.

600
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,604
Miss Langley's daughter is here. Okay.

601
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,110
- Miss Langley's daughter?
- [Alex] Hiya.

602
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,906
We dropped the hold on your mother.
She was discharged at 1:45 today.

603
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,200
- What do you mean?
- The DCR determined

604
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,036
she no longer met the criteria
to be detained.

605
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,081
The DCR can just change their mind?

606
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,918
If collateral information
is given from immediate family.

607
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,504
What family? I'm her only family.

608
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,922
A Basil Desmond.

609
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,925
He gave collateral
and she was discharged into his care.

610
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,804
How the fuck did Basil know she was here?
Was she allowed to call him?

611
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,639
It's not a prison, Miss Russell.

612
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,477
[Sean] Maybe it's good.

613
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,689
You've been responsible for your mom
your entire life.

614
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,775
If she wants to run off with Basil,
what can you do?

615
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,360
I don't feel like doing this.

616
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,948
- I'll just drop you guys off and go home.
- No. Everyone wants to see you.

617
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,451
Tania was your best friend for years.

618
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,329
- I should have given collateral.
- Hey, don't beat yourself up.

619
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,750
She's not your child.
You can't force her to do anything.

620
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,419
And you got a job today.

621
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,132
Island Friends agreed
to let Maddy come part-time

622
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,093
so I can drop her off,
clean Regina's and then pick her back up.

623
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,429
Yeah, see? You rocked it.

624
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,138
For Maddy.

625
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,559
[indistinct chatter]

626
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,188
Can I have your attention, please?

627
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,398
I'm gonna say a few words about Ethan.

628
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,816
[all clamoring]

629
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,490
The man who has done nothing right
since I met him in the second grade.

630
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,366
Including second grade itself,

631
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,868
which he repeated twice.

632
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,829
- Yeah, true story.
- [Ethan] Dick.

633
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,372
Nineteen years I've known this guy.

634
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,917
I thought I knew
what his life would look like,

635
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,835
and I thought I knew exactly who he was.

636
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,671
But what I didn't know
was the power of Tania.

637
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,216
- Thank you.
- [crowd applauding]

638
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,425
Thank you.

639
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:48,263
Yeah. She smoothed his rough edges.
You encouraged him to get an education.

640
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,058
Got him to stop wearing
those lime-green Crocs.

641
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,184
[all laughing]

642
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,062
- Yes.
- [Sean] Well done.

643
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,690
You saw what he could be.
Helped him get there.

644
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,277
So let's all raise a glass to Ethan...

645
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,114
who is doing what we all told him to do
from day one:

646
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,908
Marry this magnificent woman.

647
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,159
Cheers.

648
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,410
[all cheering]

649
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,000
[rock music playing over speakers]

650
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,170
- That was really great.
- Thanks.

651
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,673
You can relax.

652
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,467
Hey, come here.
That's it, come here, sweetie.

653
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,099
Hey. You.

654
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,478
Thanks for coming.

655
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,481
I wasn't sure you would.

656
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:45,070
Me neither, but then I was like,
"There's probably gonna be free food..."

657
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,947
Yeah.

658
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,700
Congratulations.

659
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
I love that you did it at City Hall.
Very cool.

660
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,331
Yeah, with the reception in the bar
I've worked in for six years.

661
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,666
Very romantic.

662
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,001
- Amazing.
- Yeah...

663
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,879
Yeah, we're trying to save money.
I'm, uh...

664
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,338
pregnant.

665
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,341
- Oh, my God, wow!
- Yeah.

666
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,634
Congratulations!

667
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,803
That's amazing. Wow.

668
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,598
Yeah. [laughs]

669
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,852
So you and Sean are back on?

670
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,937
Oh, no. Uh...

671
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,981
No, I'm just staying there
for a little bit.

672
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,320
Oh. Does he know that?
He's been saying the opposite to Ethan.

673
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,280
[Alex] Um...

674
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,490
Um...

675
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,578
Can I use your printer?
I need to print my ferry pass.

676
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,121
At my wedding?

677
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,665
Yep. Sorry, my phone's out of minutes.

678
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,834
Yeah, my iPad's behind the bar.

679
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,271
[laughs]

680
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,655
What are you smiling about?

681
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,239
I...

682
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,950
I got a scholarship to Missoula,

683
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,035
the same as four years ago,
I just found out.

684
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,536
No fucking way.

685
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,455
That's awesome!

686
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,499
Oh, my God.

687
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,334
What's awesome?

688
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,378
Well, this smarty-pants here

689
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,422
just got a scholarship to Missoula, again.

690
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,757
[Ethan] Yeah, get it.

691
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,301
When did you apply?

692
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,389
I reapplied a few weeks ago. It was free.

693
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,641
Why didn't you tell me?

694
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,020
Wasn't anything to tell. I literally
just found out 30 seconds ago.

695
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,147
You didn't think
taking my daughter to Montana

696
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,941
was something that we should discuss?

697
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,026
Um...

698
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,363
Hmm?

00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,623
I don't know why you're acting this way.

701
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,874
How else should I react?

702
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,002
You could be happy for me?

703
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,630
I'm working two jobs, busting my ass
to be a better person for you.

704
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,881
For absolutely no reason.

705
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,634
You had a getaway car
parked outside the entire time.

706
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,554
- That's not what this is.
- Oh, what am I doing any of this for?

707
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,514
I really don't even...

708
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,976
Do you have any idea
how hard it is not to fucking drink!

709
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,352
You're gonna wake up Maddy.

710
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,774
I thought we were building something
together, as a family.

711
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,071
It's a writing program, Sean.

712
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,033
- This has nothing to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me?

713
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,367
Is Nate going with you?

714
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,495
- [laughs] No. No.
- You say that like I should know better.

715
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,290
But I don't know shit.
I don't know what you're applying to,

716
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,544
I don't know what your plan is without me.
This whole thing is fucking fucked!

717
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,629
Get in the car!

718
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,801
Get in the car!

Nate's car.

[clears throat]

732
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,185
- What are you talking about?
- I gave it back to the prick.

733
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,355
I'm sick of looking at another man's car
in my driveway.

734
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,066
You didn't do that. You didn't do that.

735
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,027
- You gave it back to him?
- Yeah.

736
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,571
No. No.

737
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,365
- Look, if he wants to do charity work...
- No, no!

738
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,243
- ...he could donate it to the Red Cross.
- Sean! That's my car!

739
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,913
That is my life. That is my only way
for me to leave here!

740
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,497
Sean, that is the only way

741
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,042
- for me to do anything...
- [yelling] I'm late for work!
