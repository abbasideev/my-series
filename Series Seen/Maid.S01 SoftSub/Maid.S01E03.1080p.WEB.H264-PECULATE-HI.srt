250
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,500
and a day care
that she's very familiar with.

00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,563
Larry taught me in his Bronco.

334
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,149
Weren't you in middle school
when we lived out here?

335
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,528
Nope. I got picked up
for my junior prom out here.

336
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,824
- In my senior year, we went to Craig's.
- Craig?

337
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,287
Yeah. He lived down by the reservoir,
and he had a pet ferret.

338
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,370
Oh.

339
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,541
Craig. Shit, but you know...

340
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,210
Larry was a good guy.

341
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:40,090
Always trying to pin me down. Poor thing.

342
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,890
It might be hard for him
to part with the obelisk,

343
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,934
so let me take the lead on that.

344
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,937
You know, people get
really attached to their art.

345
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,566
We also have to get Grandma's furniture,
which is the reason that we're here.

346
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,402
Yeah, yeah. So how do I look?

347
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,362
Are my girls too out?

348
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,114
You look good.

349
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,115
- [yells]
- [Paula] Oh!

350
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,701
[laughs] Oh, shit!

351
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,830
- Good job, squirt.
- Oh, my God! What the hell!

352
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,001
Sorry about Wicket.
That's the way he says hi.

353
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,585
Hi, Larry.

354
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,587
[Larry] Is that Alex?

355
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,382
Holy shit, sister, you're all grown up!

356
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,550
Hi, Larry.

357
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,720
Paula, would you look at you, huh?

358
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,223
- It's been a minute.
- Cute grandson.

359
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,559
Wicket? Oh, no, that's my son.

360
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,394
Your son?

361
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,231
Yeah, I got a couple of new additions
running around. They're with their mom.

362
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,149
Up there!

363
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,233
Say hi, Petal!

364
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,279
She looks like a fucking bitch.

365
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,822
[Larry laughing]

366
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,906
Oh, Paula.

367
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,786
So you ladies finally want
your old furniture back, huh?

368
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,870
It's in the barn.

369
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:57,876
Hey, look, Lar, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to take the obelisk.

370
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,920
[Larry] What's an obelisk?

371
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,213
[Paula chuckles]

372
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,925
The bronze statue that I made
for you when you turned 45.

373
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,802
Oh.

374
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,387
It's a big, pointy thing.

375
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,598
Oh. Oh. [chuckles]

376
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,601
- You mean the big dick sculpture?
- That's the one.

377
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,773
It's an obelisk. It's the ancient symbol
of the sun god, Ra.

378
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,067
[Larry] Yeah. I got that in the barn too.

379
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,568
You keep it in the barn?

380
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,489
That's a really important
early work of mine.

381
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,367
Well, Petal moved in.
I had to make some space.

382
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,954
Pull the truck up to the barn door,
will you, kiddo?

383
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,166
[Paula] Petal, that's not a name.

384
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,043
Hey, it's my old softball bat.

385
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,963
He told me that he would
never get married again,

386
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,924
that he was too set in his ways.

387
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,593
Why do you care, Mom?
You guys broke up a decade ago.

388
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,429
I don't understand why you're upset.

389
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:55,183
If he was gonna break his stupid
marriage rule, it should have been for me.

390
00:23:55,267 --> 00:24:00,772
- These are all my old journals.
- My ass was completely out in the wind.

391
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,984
Moving my whole art studio into his house.

392
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,902
And your daughter.

393
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,364
- She's so young.
- So is Basil, Mom.

394
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,451
This is great. Mom.

395
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,679
- [Paula] My God.
- I found it.

396
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,665
- I can't believe he left it here.
- Is this gonna fit in the truck?

397
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,292
Wow.

398
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,378
- That dick's bigger than I remember.
- Are you blind?

399
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,714
Nothing about that looks like a penis.

400
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,551
Come on, Alex. You lift by the balls.
I'll take the shaft.

401
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,972
- [Alex] Is this the balls right here?
- [Larry] Yep.

402
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,146
Thanks for the help, Mom.

403
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,482
Can we go now?

404
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,985
- You're being very rude.
- Rude?

405
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,071
What I am is running out of time
to find love, Alex,

406
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,657
because I wasted time on that clown.

407
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,325
Hey, Mom...

408
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,330
we're about to drop your art at a gallery.

409
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,041
You're a working artist.

410
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,336
Life's good. You're good.

411
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,838
You're right.

412
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,508
There she goes.

413
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,719
We're rescuing the obelisk
from the philistines,

414
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,722
and now we're gonna
deliver it to superior people.

415
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,059
Mm-hm.
You're gonna wave goodbye to this nice man

416
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,394
who stored your stuff
for an entire decade, yep?

417
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,401
Put a bra on, bitch. [laughs]

fill out my form now?

00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,169
Write that I'm a good mom,
that I'm stable and able,

Please, this is very important.

Hey.

- What do you want me to say?
- That I'm a good mom.

428
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,314
That I take great care of Maddy.

429
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,401
If you add that Sean is abusive,
that would be helpful.

00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,825
Sean? [laughing]

432
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,202
Emotional abuse is abuse.

433
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,416
What does that even mean?
How can emotions be abused?

434
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,376
Where do people get this stuff?

435
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,422
All right. Did you notice
that we were in a bank earlier?

436
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,924
- Yep.
- Did you notice what I was doing?

437
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,259
Banking.

438
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,429
I was opening a bank account
because I don't have one

439
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,515
because Sean took my ATM card
when I didn't pay the electric bill

440
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,392
and said he would handle all money.

441
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:46,479
Honey, Sean's good with money,
and you're like me, shitty with it.

442
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,610
Or I was isolated in a trailer
for two years without any access to money,

443
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,821
and that's financial abuse,
a form of emotional abuse.

No. I'm getting this
from the DV shelter, Mom.

446
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,622
This is why I don't go to the doctor,

447
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,834
because if you start poking around
because you think something's wrong,

448
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,753
you're gonna find something.

449
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,422
That's an incredibly fucked-up
point of view.

450
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,301
Hey, I'm helping you move.
I'm gonna fill out your form.

451
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,386
I'm obviously supporting you here,

452
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,223
but can I name 450 things
that men have done to me

453
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,809
that are worse than balancing a checkbook?

454
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,227
Yes, I can!

455
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:31,441
Your chickenshit father, for one,
turned against me because I wanted

456
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,485
to be more than a boring townie!

457
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:37,530
- And you've had some moods, I'd say.
- I have passion.

458
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,076
- All that man had was depression.
- Okay, Mother.

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,331
Oh...

00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:51,252
Ask and you shall receive,
my friend, my friend!

462
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,548
- Honey, put it right there!
- Ask and receive?

463
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,258
- It could be the centerpiece.
- Of?

464
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,637
My show! I've got the rest
of the stuff out in the truck.

465
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,141
Some very heady stuff, really cerebral.

466
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:09,896
Ten paintings, four sculptures,
some mixed media. Oh, shit!

467
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:15,819
I said mixed media. I meant mixed metal,
but, babe, I can get you some media.

468
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,404
- There's been some...
- Hey, Mom.

469
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,323
You know what,
we just need to clear that wall...

470
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,784
- Hey, Mom.
- ...and face the obelisk north

471
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,245
- because we don't want any shadows, honey.
- Mom.

472
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,498
- Honey, can't you see I'm talking?
- Yes, I can.

473
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,292
But he's trying to say something to you.
Something's wrong.

474
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,378
Oh! Darling Fey, I'm so sorry.

475
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,297
- What is it?
- Um, we've got our wires crossed.

476
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,383
I didn't offer you a show.

477
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,138
You said that my work
deserved a larger audience

478
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,848
and that I should bring it in.

479
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,224
I meant in a general sense,

480
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,728
like I'd maybe do a show with a group
of local artists in the future.

481
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,813
I didn't mean now.

482
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,191
You said that you were kicking yourself

483
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,486
for not snagging one of my bronzes
when you could have.

484
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,072
That's just a thing people say to be nice.

485
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,614
You know, I...

486
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,745
I'm so sorry, Paula.
You know what a fan I am.

487
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,539
What would this town be
without you and your pizzazz?

488
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,084
Ah.

489
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,130
I understand completely.

490
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,551
Thank you for your interest in my work.

491
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,514
I will be in the car.

492
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,778
- Any chance I can leave this with you?
- Absolutely not.

493
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:56,044
He sounded like he was really serious
about the group show with local artists.

494
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,670
I bet you'd headline that.

495
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,965
And we got the obelisk back, Mom.

496
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,761
Basil's coming over.
He's bringing your paints.

497
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:09,724
You can do the mural for Maddy,
with sunflowers, all those butterflies.

498
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,685
That's gonna cheer you right up.

00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,364
[Basil] You're an extremely rude person,
aren't you?

501
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,007
[Alex] We don't have to talk, Cilantro.

502
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,661
Not even saying thank you to the guy
that gives you a hand.

503
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:33,081
I said thank you right when you got here,
and I meant it. Thank you.

504
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,334
- We both know you were being sarcastic.
- Okay.

505
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,546
What did you say to your mother, anyway?
Why is she in such a state?

506
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,297
[Alex] She's upset about her art show.

507
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,552
- Wait, she had an art show?
- She most certainly did not.

508
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,219
I'm confused.

509
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:53,184
Basil, you're just not gonna be around
long enough for me to explain this to you.

510
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,353
Let me explain something, Alex.

511
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,897
Your mother and I, we're in love.

512
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,944
You're gonna be gone in three months,
and I'm gonna be like, "Bye!"

513
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,697
That's an awful lot of meanness
coming from someone

514
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,699
who scrubs toilets for a living.

515
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,702
[Alex] Meanness?
Is that what they say in fake Australia?

516
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:17,000
- Hey, Paula! Your daughter's being rude.
- I have a genius idea!

517
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,671
How good does a burger and a beer
sound right now, huh?

518
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,754
Yeah.

519
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,676
- Thanks again for all your help.
- Oh, yeah, you bet.

520
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,346
Have a burger and a beer with us, honey.
You haven't eaten all day.

521
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,140
I've got way too much to do.

522
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,060
But sweetheart, I've got to fill
that form out. I can do it there!

523
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,981
- Okay.
- [Paula] Fuck the Hummingbird.

524
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,568
Why is it even called the Hummingbird?
It's stupid.

525
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,195
I'm not going to another one
of their openings ever again.

526
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,114
Free cheese or not.

527
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:53,494
It has taken me my entire life
to become the artist that I am.

528
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,204
[Basil] Baby, you inspire.

529
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,747
Oh.

530
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,165
See?

531
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,420
Basil appreciates me. He values my time.

532
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,089
Unlike Larry.

533
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,842
- Who's Larry?
- I mean, what is it with this town?

534
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,554
They just wanna keep me
imprisoned in mediocrity.

535
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,057
Okay. Hey. Time to get out of here, guys.

536
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,142
- Time to go.
- No, we want another round, so...

537
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,728
No, I've got to get
to the clerk's office by 7 p.m.

538
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,813
Fine.

539
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,568
We'll get the check. <i>Garçon!</i>
Could she get the check, please?

540
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,488
- Why would the check come to me?
- [Basil] You're paying.

541
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,533
We helped you move, the least
you can do is buy us a couple of burgers.

542
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,744
You guys invited me,
so you were gonna pay.

543
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,873
- Babe, we can put this on my credit card.
- No, no, no.

544
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,877
It's the principle.
It's Happy Hour, it's not expensive.

545
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,588
[Paula] It's 36.85!

546
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,423
You can pay for that!

547
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,967
- Can't you?
- No, I can't.

548
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,719
You just got a job, Alex.

549
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,888
You just moved me into a homeless shelter.

550
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,769
Okay, well, you just pay for the burgers,
and we'll pay for the beer!

551
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,355
- That's fair.
- I can't pay for any of it.

552
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,109
- I have exactly six bucks until payday.
- [Basil] Six bucks.

553
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,778
That's not enough to pay for your burger.

554
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,408
- Unbelievable.
- It's not very considerate, Alex.

555
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,491
No.

556
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,743
Okay.

557
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,914
I need the form.

558
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,750
Oh, fuck.

559
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,921
- When was that?
- Now, Mom. It's due right now.

560
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,882
I'm gonna write "not applicable"
because you are not applicable.

561
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,844
You are not my character witness.
You cannot speak on my behalf.

562
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,388
You can't buy me a burger
on the worst week of my life.

563
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,432
You are the shittiest mother
on the planet.

564
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,308
[Paula] I'm not the shittiest.

565
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,520
I never lost custody of you.

566
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,155
I know what you're thinking.
Today we'll be walking the catwalk.

567
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,783
No, not that kind of modeling, moms.

568
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:01,456
Today is about what you're teaching
your child through your own behavior,

569
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,042
what you model to them.

570
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:09,380
Now, it sounds cliché,
but your actions speak louder than words.

571
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:14,510
Your children see how you handle stress,
how you treat other people.

572
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,639
They soak all that info in
like little sponges.

573
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,643
Children follow our example.

574
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:27,982
Kids don't come out of the womb
knowing how to be violent and rude.

575
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,735
They learn it, from you.

576
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,361
Let's take a scenario.

577
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,284
[cell phone beeps]

578
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,374
- What's up, Ethan?
- Hey, Sean's not with you, is he?

579
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,542
<i>No, he's not. Why?</i>

580
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,377
- Okay, cool.
- He's probably at work?

581
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,089
Yeah, he didn't show up.
It's fine. I'm covering for him.

582
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,966
<i>But he'll get fired
if he doesn't show up for the night shift.</i>

583
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,886
- What time was he supposed to be there?
<i>- 11, to open.</i>

584
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,014
But he probably overslept,
let his phone die. We had a late night.

585
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,600
Did you call his mom
and tell her to wake his ass up?

586
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,477
I did. He's not there.

587
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,521
Okay, bye.

588
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,481
[cell phone ringing]

589
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,692
- [Doreen] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, is Maddy with you?

590
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,278
Yes, she's right here. She's fine.

591
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,988
We're having our snack.

592
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,991
- Okay, where is Sean?
- Uh, work, I think.

593
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,160
Bullshit.
Did Sean not come home last night?

594
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,248
- That's my son's business.
- Sean staying out all night isn't unusual,

595
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,334
but he always shows up for work
the next day, so something's wrong.

596
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>When was the last time you heard from him?</i>

597
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,548
<i>- Two days ago.</i>
- Is Maddy good with you a bit longer?

598
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,091
<i>- Yep, she is.</i>
- Okay.

599
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,094
- Bye. Jasmine!
- Yeah?

600
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,179
[pensive music playing]

601
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,276
Okay, I'm gonna jump out here.
This is perfect.

602
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,110
What are you doing down here
getting wrecked by yourself, Sean?

603
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,194
I'm hiding.

604
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,654
Go away.

605
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,114
Can you stand?

606
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,620
I'm fine. I'll be a mess
when the coke wears off, though.

607
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,584
Okay, give me your keys. Give me
your keys. I'm gonna drive you home.

608
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,672
- I'm not my mom.
- Then stop acting like your mom!

609
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,475
You know why there's so much sea glass
on this beach?

610
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,229
It was a dump once.

611
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,313
Way back.

612
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,526
Sea turns trash into treasure over time.

613
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,449
Why don't you like me anymore?

614
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,788
You hired a lawyer and got a judge
to take my kid away from me.

615
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,375
No, before that.
You stopped liking me a long time ago.

616
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,961
Why?

617
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,632
I like you enough to pick you up
when you're drunk.

618
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,634
Why?

619
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,388
Because you're Maddy's dad.

620
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,724
Is that the only reason?

621
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,030
This used to be fun.

622
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,033
We had fun together.

623
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,373
We used to come down here and laugh.

624
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,166
And fuck.

625
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,382
Now, it's just like...

626
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,971
- "You're a piece of shit, Sean."
- It can't be fun all the time.

627
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,181
Maddy's a really big responsibility.

628
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,853
I'm sea glass.

629
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,025
I'm not trash.

630
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,030
Just give me time.

631
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,613
I'm not...

632
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,082
Okay, let's get out of here. Come on.

633
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,926
Make more treasure, waves!

634
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,681
[Sean grunts]

635
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,936
I'm gonna throw up for a quick sec.
I'll meet you at the car.

636
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,333
He just needs to sleep it off.

637
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,213
- Is Maddy asleep?
- [Doreen] Mm-hm.

638
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,175
- Can I give her a kiss on the forehead?
- Yeah, go ahead.

639
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,861
[emotional music playing]

640
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,297
Just like his daddy.

641
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,426
A bird that never flew.

642
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,727
Where's your certificate of completion?
For the PEP class?

643
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,232
- We didn't get one.
- Oh, yes, you did.

644
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,609
Gary gives it out
at the end of the last class.

645
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,656
I stepped out to take a phone call.

646
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,284
Where are your character witness
statements?

647
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,535
I tried. I couldn't get any.

648
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,412
[groans]

649
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,539
Is this really bad?

650
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,168
The court likes to see
those things, so it's not great, no.

651
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,173
But you go in and say how stable
and able you are to care for Maddy.

652
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,844
[Sean]
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

653
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,388
[Alex] Yeah.

654
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,436
[clears throat]

655
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,146
Hi.

656
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,565
Hi.

657
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,155
I just went to a meeting.

658
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,369
Sorry about yesterday.

659
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,080
- Thank you for...
- Sure.

660
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,590
So I'm gonna drop the whole
ex parte, whatever, motion.

661
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,799
Um...

662
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,678
I don't want full custody.

663
00:41:56,138 --> 00:42:01,852
I mean, I do want it, but I can't
do Maddy 24/7 and stay sober.

664
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:08,651
I can't have my fucking mom living
with me, triggering the shit out of me.

665
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,949
And... Maddy misses you.

666
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,370
She does?

667
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:27,378
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy" all the time.
"Where's my mommy? Where's my mommy?"

668
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm like, "Fuck if I know, kid."

669
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,180
But if we're gonna do this,
it's shared custody.

670
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,308
- Okay, she's mine too.
- Yeah.

671
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,397
Yeah. Okay. We can figure that out.

672
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,985
And if you total another car with her
in it, we'll be right back here in court.

673
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:57,032
Okay, yeah. Same here, if you get
drunk again while you're in charge of her.

674
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,869
Okay, then.

675
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,582
Okay, then.

676
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,257
How soon do I get to have her back?

677
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,635
And this is Mommy
and Maddy's new building.

678
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,388
This is Mommy and Maddy's
new favorite tree.

679
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,974
And this is Mommy and Maddy's friend Luis.

680
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,892
You want to say hi to Luis? Hi.

681
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,062
Your mom was here. I let her in.
Next time I won't.

682
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,733
- Okay. Is she still in there?
- No. Came and went.

683
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,901
Thank you. Sorry about that.

684
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,990
And here we have Mommy
and Maddy's new stairs.

685
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,869
And this is Mommy
and Maddy's new apartment.

686
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,456
Mommy and Maddy's new kitchen.

687
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,374
Maddy's new bedroom!
