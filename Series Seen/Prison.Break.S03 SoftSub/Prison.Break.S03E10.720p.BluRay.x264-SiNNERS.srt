1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,778
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:06,906
How does a simple fisherman
know so much about the Company?

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:08,658
- You gonna do this or not?
- Yes.

4
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,952
Once we're out,
I consider you collateral.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,913
Lincoln causes as many problems
as he solves.

6
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:17,333
He needs to get out of his own way,
and I think you can assist him.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,044
I stay one step ahead
and you get 50 grand.

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,088
- What happened?
- She came up to me.

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,590
And offered me a cash
to talk behind your back.

10
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,968
- So we stick to the plan, right?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,846
I found a passport. Who's Gary Miller?

12
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:34,517
- I've been working for us to be together.
- James, how can I believe you?

13
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:36,811
How can I believe anything anymore?

14
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,032
Yeah!

15
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,367
You can dig our way out?

16
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,328
- We'll need support brace for the tunnel.
- Or what?

17
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:57,665
Or the whole thing collapses
and we're buried alive.

18
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:07,133
No more excuses.
Papo's dead because of this Yankee.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,218
I'll kill him myself if I have to.

20
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:11,888
- He survived the box.
- So what?

21
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:17,935
The guards went after Scofield.

22
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,397
Scofield won. He's a folk hero now.

23
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:29,655
Look, I want Scofield dead as much as
you, but not at the cost of an uprising.

24
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:00,061
Mail.

25
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,172
Who's that?

26
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:30,716
That's my son.

27
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,136
Bagwell gave the okay.
The coast is clear.

28
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:36,430
We gotta go.

29
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:42,895
I didn't think I'd see you again.

30
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,856
When someone goes into the box...

31
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,651
There was a misunderstanding.

32
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:51,153
They wanted to talk to you
about the helicopters?

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,614
What helicopters?

34
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,117
Were you really trying to escape?

35
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:59,662
I don't know what you're talking about
and neither do you.

36
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:04,250
Just so you know,
Bagwell's coming with us.

37
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:08,546
You were gone. He had something
we needed, I didn't have a choice.

38
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:17,221
- Fine.
- So, what's the new plan?

39
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,147
- Did you tell them?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:29,567
- I am coming with you.
- Okay by me.

41
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,569
Everyone hear that?
Did you hear that?

42
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:35,030
- But you're staying up here.
- Maybe I didn't enunciate myself.

43
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,367
The work downstairs
requires two hands.

44
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:41,787
Hey.

45
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,790
We need somebody to stay outside
in case Sammy returns.

46
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,479
Whoa.

47
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,565
I thought we couldn't dig
through this.

48
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:10,983
Bracing's gonna be tricky.

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,653
Unless the tunnel gets proper support,
it's gonna come down on our heads.

50
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,739
We should have materials
for the braces.

51
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:20,034
But we'll need a saw
to cut them to size and a hammer.

52
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:24,079
- Can you help us out?
- Yeah, I can do that.

53
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,709
Two days.

54
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:30,961
And if not?

55
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,672
Two days.

56
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,135
Guillermo should have everything
we need.

57
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,137
- Know who he is, right?
- I think it's--

58
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:42,890
It's down this corridor on the left.

59
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:46,143
Halfway down. Cell 40.

60
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,940
Down the corridor on the left, Cell 40.
Okey-doke.

61
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,623
Are you lost already, Teodoro?

62
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,541
No.

63
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,003
But you are.

64
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,704
This is my room now.

65
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,000
You're done in here.

66
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,338
If you'd gone after Scofield today,
all would've been forgiven.

67
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:59,174
- This is suicide, man.
- Shut up, old man.

68
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:01,844
I'll take my chances.

69
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,888
Yeah? You think you run Sona?

70
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:07,766
You couldn't run shipments
from one dock to the other...

71
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,185
...but I still keep you by my side.

72
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:19,403
I'll let you walk out of here
out of respect for what you were.

73
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,739
Come on.

74
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,286
You get the hell out of here.

75
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,919
All of you ready to do this?

76
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:42,759
Until Lechero gets back...

77
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,721
...we should start looking for pieces
about 4 feet in length.

78
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,924
I'm running things now!

79
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:27,262
Anyone got a problem with that...

80
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,224
...come get it.

81
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,859
Good.

82
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,737
First order of business.

83
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:48,241
A case of rum to the man
who brings me Michael Scofield!

84
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,660
Okay? Gracia.

85
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:36,289
Osberto.
That's who you wanna talk to.

86
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:37,749
This guy on the up and up?

87
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,252
The guy I was running things for
arranged this...

88
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,755
...so it's as up as it's gonna get
for this kind of deal, so yes.

89
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:46,800
Osberto doesn't speak English,
so how do you wanna work it?

90
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,385
I need to meet with Susan.

91
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:51,805
I'll take Sofia, she can translate for me.
Don't worry about it.

92
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:55,434
So when I meet with Susan,
what do you want me to tell her?

93
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,811
Tell her whatever you think
she wants to hear.

94
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:01,106
- Buy us enough time to do our thing.
- Home stretch, papi.

95
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:03,191
I wanna thank you for everything.

96
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,527
- Please--
- When we get home, I got your back.

97
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:08,864
- Whatever you need, whatever you want.
- That won't be necessary.

98
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,199
When I'm back home, I'm a saint.

99
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:12,868
I'm not even jaywalking.

100
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:15,579
Osberto. Don't forget.

101
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,622
Osberto.

102
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:41,396
If Scofield steps outside that tunnel,
he's a dead man.

103
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,607
As far as I can tell,
we have two options.

104
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:45,650
We can invite Sammy on the escape.

105
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:47,152
He can go to hell.

106
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:50,697
Which brings us to option number two.

107
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,034
You wouldn't last a second
with Sammy.

108
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,994
Would you?

109
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:03,293
Then I guess
we'll just have to outsource.

110
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,012
I felt sorry for the guy, but you don't
chicken foot an ex-Delta Force...

111
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,014
...and expect to make it out alive.

112
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:18,308
You're Delta Force?
Like Chuck Norris?

113
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,602
Norris? He wouldn't have made it
through boot camp.

114
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,147
- Ahem.
- Excuse me a sec.

115
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,650
I see you're making friends.

116
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:30,403
Hey, once you get the hang of it,
this place ain't so rough.

117
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,782
- Too bad.
- Too bad what?

118
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:36,785
You were right.
We got a little plan going on.

119
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:39,829
- But if you're putting down roots, then--
- No, no.

120
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:41,456
You were saying?

121
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,709
We're supposed to be out of here
in 48 hours.

122
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:47,128
Not through Scofield.
You heard the town crier.

123
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:50,715
College boy's life
is barely worth a case of booze.

124
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:52,968
Hence our current conversation.

125
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:56,888
I know how you got your cherry
yesterday.

126
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,976
Dabbing your wraps in acetone...

127
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:05,188
...smothering the guy
until he passed out from the fumes.

128
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,441
You do the same thing to Sammy,
and you're in.

129
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:12,404
- Chicken foot Sammy?
- Chicken foot Sammy.

130
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:16,116
It's all riding on you, champ.

131
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,257
Thank you.

132
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,094
- This shouldn't take long.
- What are you getting?

133
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,596
- Supplies.
- For?

134
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,765
I don't wanna get caught
flatfooted again.

135
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,517
- You know what that means?
- No.

136
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:45,353
These people have a plan.
We're gonna need one too.

137
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,356
Does that plan
include screwing over James?

138
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,442
- Is it James or Gary Miller?
- Whatever.

139
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:54,195
There is a part of me that doesn't
wanna believe he works for them.

140
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:58,116
He's the man I loved,
the man who went to prison for me.

141
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:01,953
The man who was gonna take me
to my first trip to Paris.

142
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,706
I haven't turned my back to that man.

143
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:08,084
Do I have your word
that he's gonna be all right?

144
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:09,753
Yeah. Now, get in.

145
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:12,630
Do I have your word?

146
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,175
Yeah, you got my word.

147
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:18,636
Now, get in.

148
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,919
You know what I just found out?

149
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:53,046
That sucre means sugar.

150
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:54,631
Yeah.

151
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:58,384
So every time I say your name,
I'm calling you sugar.

152
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:02,138
- Basically, yeah.
- I like that.

153
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:05,892
Look, I don't have a lot of information.

154
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:08,811
Which, I guess,
that's good news for you, right?

155
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:10,939
You care to elaborate?

156
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,025
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.

157
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:17,153
He's still planning on exchanging
Whistler for L.J.

158
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,822
He hasn't been talking
about running any games.

159
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,825
And did he become an Eagle Scout
last night too?

160
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:24,494
Lady, he got the message.

161
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:27,872
He knows he doesn't have a choice.
He has to play it straight.

162
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,920
Look, I could've come up here
and made something up just to get paid.

163
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,258
I'm not trying to get
on your bad side either.

164
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:40,093
You know what?

165
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:43,012
I believe you.

166
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:47,642
So I'll call you if anything comes up.

167
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,437
Whoa, whoa. What am I,
a toothless crack whore? Sit down.

168
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,569
I keep my promises.

169
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:02,156
The people I work for,
they don't like to deal in greenbacks.

170
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:03,700
It's just too bulky.

171
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:07,078
Cashier's check, payable to cash.
Same thing.

172
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:12,083
Half now and half when you're done.

173
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,800
Keep your ears open, sugar.

174
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:37,483
- Hold it steady.
- I am steady. I am.

175
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,403
We need a little help here.

176
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:46,701
I got it. I said I got it.

177
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:52,665
That little piece of metal
is gonna hold all this weight?

178
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,293
All right, let go.

179
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,295
Let go.

180
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,932
How many more are we gonna need
before we get to the top?

181
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:11,768
Twenty, maybe.

182
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:14,103
That gets us to no man's land.
Then what?

183
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:15,521
Helicopter would be nice.

184
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:20,568
Hey, I was supposed to kill you.

185
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,028
So you're not a fisherman.

186
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:25,865
They threatened to come after my family
if I didn't kill you...

187
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,909
...and jump on their helicopter.

188
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:30,161
- But I didn't.
- I'm so grateful.

189
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:33,623
- What happened to your family?
- I don't know.

190
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,875
Maybe I'll find out
if we get out of here.

191
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,504
Well, it's a crazy world, isn't it?

192
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:42,673
We all agree on that.
And we have a lot of work to do.

193
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:52,225
Where the hell is Lechero?

194
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,186
- Is everything set?
- Huh?

195
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:56,395
Is everything set?

196
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,940
Yeah. No problemo.

197
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,328
Excuse me, sir.

198
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,540
Do we come to you
if we need the chicken foot?

199
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,166
That depends.

200
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,960
Who you got beef with?

201
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,337
I don't know his name.
Some Caribbean guy.

202
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,923
Stole my wallet a while back.

203
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:28,970
You better think long and hard
before you say another word, eh?

204
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:33,182
He's got this fruity little mustache
and this ugly-ass vest.

205
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:38,646
Please, I'm begging you.

206
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,253
In the ring. Fifteen minutes.

207
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,103
I never thought I'd say this,
but I envy you, Brad.

208
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,148
I've wanted to shank
that calypso kid since I first met him.

209
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,399
I'm not violent...

210
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:26,193
...but if a man makes me
walk around in my grunds for two days--

211
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,196
That's great. Just don't take
too long in finishing him off.

212
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:31,741
The sooner he's dead,
the sooner we can escape.

213
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,576
- No games. I'm in.
- You're in.

214
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,538
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?

215
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:40,791
- We gotta call off the fight.
- You know that's an impossibility.

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,461
No, no, no. You don't understand.

217
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:45,671
There's gotta be more acetone
around here.

218
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:46,922
No, that's it.

219
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,800
I can't go against Sammy straight up.
I'm a dead man.

220
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:53,637
If you don't kill him, we are all dead.

221
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,368
This isn't the best neighborhood.

222
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:20,623
I've been in a lot worse.
Just stick close.

223
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:28,506
Osberto?

224
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:33,969
You wanna do this?

225
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,143
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

226
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:02,122
Where is the money?

227
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:08,462
I wanna see the product.

228
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,387
- Money first.
- Show me the stuff.

229
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:22,434
- Lincoln, please, let's get out of here.
- Tell him to stop wasting my time.

230
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:24,103
No.

231
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:26,063
Tell him.

232
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:48,752
Oh, my God.

233
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:55,801
Big?

234
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,267
Ask him how do I trigger it by remote.

235
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,185
Um...

236
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,112
Boom!

237
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:17,948
Dial 11 send.

238
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,534
- 11 send?
- Yeah.

239
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,044
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna buy a bomb?

240
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:32,171
You never would've come otherwise.

241
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:39,303
We need that saw.

242
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,890
You know, I am a fisherman.

243
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:46,727
I am. I'm just maybe a little bit
more connected than I've let on.

244
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:52,066
- I think this is gonna work.
- Yeah.

245
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:57,446
You know, I run charters, just like I said.
I have for years.

246
00:20:57,654 --> 00:20:59,239
Then one day, Gretchen...

247
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:02,618
...asked me if I wanted to be exclusive
to her corporation, right?

248
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,579
And, well, with the money
she was offering...

249
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:08,582
...I had a good idea
she wasn't just trolling for salmon.

250
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,210
- So you two have history.
- Yeah.

251
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:15,172
And she's been an absolute nightmare
in my life ever since that first job.

252
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,967
- Alex, I need a wedge.
- A wedge, a wedge.

253
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:21,220
I took them where they wanted.

254
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,722
I have to figure out coordinates,
take them back.

255
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:27,351
- Quit embarrassing yourself.
- What?

256
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:30,270
We're not chicks to pick up.
You need to hear this?

257
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,439
- No.
- Good. You work for the Company.

258
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,024
When you break out of here...

259
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:37,194
...you're gonna do whatever
the Company asks you to do, period.

260
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,238
They're using me
like they're using you.

261
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:43,617
I'm glad you shared that. Why don't we
go back to work. How's that sound?

262
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,711
Let those idiots chicken foot themselves
all they want, huh?

263
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:57,089
But if one of them tries
to use it on us...

264
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:00,843
You don't have to fight that guy.

265
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,136
It's my farewell tour.

266
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,808
The rest of those pieces are no good.

267
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:10,394
We're gonna need those tools,
Michael.

268
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,856
I guess we'll just have to wait.

269
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,732
That book of yours.

270
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:18,569
It's just a bunch of coordinates
in there, right?

271
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:20,821
Among other things.

272
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,950
So you wouldn't mind?

273
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:33,709
It's just a bunch
of numbers and dates.

274
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:35,460
"Gate."

275
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:38,964
Gate Netting Company.
It's where I rent my trammels.

276
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:41,049
Stampede?

277
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:44,344
- That's my buddy's Cape Islander.
- This is important to us how?

278
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:47,014
Because I'm accused
of being someone I'm not.

279
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,433
I don't want Scofield ditching me.

280
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,934
He's not ditching anybody.

281
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,645
If he could have,
he would've gotten rid of me.

282
00:22:53,812 --> 00:22:57,149
If he leaves the city, he knows
we'll turn him in before he gets out.

283
00:22:57,357 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm going upstairs to find Lechero
and his equipment.

284
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm with Alex.

285
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:04,573
Do you mind?

286
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:11,371
Sounds like someone's up there.

287
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:17,502
If Lechero gets stranded up there,
we're not getting out of here...

288
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:22,299
...so when you think it's safe
or it feels like it's safe, we gotta go up.

289
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:03,840
We've been talking about
chicken footing Sammy for months.

290
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,634
No one had the courage.

291
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,886
- You have any paint thinner?
- Paint thinner?

292
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:11,348
Shoe polish? Lighter fluid? Glue?

293
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:15,936
There you are, champ.

294
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:18,397
- It's time.
- Stomp his face, Brad!

295
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:21,149
You know, this has all been
one big misunderstanding.

296
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:23,652
I wasn't talking about Sammy.
It was--

297
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:26,154
That's him.
That's the guy I was talking about.

298
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:30,492
Yeah, I don't see no fruity mustache.
And where's his ugly-ass vest, Brad?

299
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,121
Don't worry. You stand a real chance
of winning this one.

300
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:44,297
You cannot just hide out all day.

301
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:48,510
What else can I do, huh? I've ruled
these men for a year with blood.

302
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:51,096
They want the head
of the man who wore the crown.

303
00:24:51,263 --> 00:24:53,056
Be that as it may.

304
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:56,935
Bellick is about to lose
his head to Sammy.

305
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:58,562
You may not wanna hear this...

306
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:01,398
...but once that happens,
we are both very much aware...

307
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:04,151
...Scofield's gonna get curious
about where you are.

308
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,238
He's gonna come crawling out
of his hole and right into Sammy's arms.

309
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:12,242
And then he and our escape
are gone forever.

310
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:59,247
Hey, we get the tools
and we come straight back.

311
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,587
Come on, I say.

312
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,848
Come on.

313
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:57,597
Hey, you guys wanna watch the fight?

314
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:02,894
You know, chill out.
I'll get you a beer.

315
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:47,105
Come on.

316
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:49,607
Yeah!

317
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:55,905
Sammy! It's Scofield!

318
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:11,379
Scofield's in there.

319
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:13,423
- It's locked.
- Open the door.

320
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,344
- I don't have the combination.
- I said open it now.

321
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:22,056
We can't. We can't.

322
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,561
- Open it now!
- I don't have the combination.

323
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:30,398
Hey, I got your man out here.

324
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:34,235
If you don't open the door,
he's the one who's gonna pay the price.

325
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:36,070
No. We need him alive.

326
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,948
You saw those guys.
What do you think they got planned?

327
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:40,742
You're trying my patience.

328
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,202
What do you suggest, Alex?

329
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:46,539
Let's be ready for them.

330
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:49,459
Time's up.

331
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:55,340
You want another one?

332
00:28:55,506 --> 00:28:58,384
Then you better be persuasive.

333
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:02,931
Michael!

334
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:06,184
Don't open the door! He's got--

335
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:16,152
- Are you gonna tell me what it's for?
- No.

336
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:20,281
- Because you think I might tell James.
- Because you don't need to know.

337
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,036
Hey.

338
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:27,330
It's gonna be all right.

339
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:33,419
- How'd you go?
- Good.

340
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,963
I told her what she wanted
just like you told me.

341
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,758
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

342
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,553
Cool. I want you to call her up,
tell her you got information.

343
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,056
Make sure she picks you up,
and get in the car.

344
00:29:45,264 --> 00:29:47,016
Okay. Is everything okay?

345
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:50,395
- Yeah. Why?
- She looks upset.

346
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,731
I'll call you later.

347
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:04,242
Got something down here
we can use, Michael.

348
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:14,335
They come through that door,
you hit them right here.

349
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:16,129
Go ahead, take it.

350
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:18,214
Go ahead.

351
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:21,426
It'll puncture their heart.

352
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:47,076
You're hiding Scofield in your room?

353
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:50,288
Look at you.
The power make you mad already.

354
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:53,958
Come along, Norman.

355
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,668
Let's go.

356
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,284
What is so urgent?

357
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,536
- Lincoln bought a gun.
- Hmm.

358
00:31:30,703 --> 00:31:34,165
I asked him what he planned on doing
with it, but he wouldn't answer.

359
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,668
So I just thought
you might wanna know.

360
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:40,713
If anything changes,
I'll get back to you, okay?

361
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,426
The other day, when you and Lincoln
had your little spat in the lobby...

362
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:50,389
...and you, all distraught and jilted,
went across the street to the bar...

363
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:53,142
...a cynic might think
that was staged.

364
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,064
I'm a cynic, sugar.

365
00:31:58,272 --> 00:31:59,649
And you're high, sugar.

366
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:02,526
If it's any comfort,
you guys almost pulled it off.

367
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,528
The Puerto Rican and the gorilla--

368
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:06,697
You had me scrambling there
for a minute.

369
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,200
If you don't want my help, fine.
I'm out, okay?

370
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:13,829
It's a little thing called a tracing number
on the check I gave you.

371
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:19,251
Apparently your extensive expertise
in banking failed you that day.

372
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,006
You promptly wired all 25K
to Maricruz Delgado...

373
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:27,843
...in Chicago at 123
Please Don't Hurt Me Lane.

374
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:31,138
- I swear to God, if something happens--
- If what?

375
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,101
What, jackass?

376
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,814
You're gonna go back there.

377
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,650
And you're gonna get me
some real information...

378
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:46,946
...or Maricruz and her head
are gonna part ways.

379
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:50,616
Get out of my car.

380
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,495
Now.

381
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:11,262
Hey, blanco,
I got your good buddy Lechero here.

382
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,848
Why don't you give him
the secret knock so he knows it's you?

383
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:17,143
- The combination.
- What makes you think...

384
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,605
- ...I have the combination?
- Hey, just do what he says, huh?

385
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:28,696
How many times
you gonna pull that out?

386
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:30,990
As many times as I feel necessary.

387
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:33,617
What, you think it make you
look strong?

388
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:35,828
All it does is magnify your weakness.

389
00:33:38,497 --> 00:33:41,917
Funny, I'm feeling pretty secure
right about now.

390
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:44,670
Now, the combination, old man.

391
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,338
We are not asking again.

392
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:50,301
Sammy.

393
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:53,929
- I'm opening the door.
- Michael, do not open it.

394
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:59,435
Drop them! Drop them, I said.

395
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,353
Now, move!

396
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,947
You're escaping with him?

397
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:15,201
I was gonna tell you all about this,
brother.

398
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,827
It just never came up, eh?

399
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,919
Take it. It's yours.

400
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:28,130
The tunnel, the escape plan,
everything.

401
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:30,049
We can go together.

402
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:32,718
Oh, I'm taking everything you got.

403
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:35,679
But you ain't going nowhere.

404
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:42,061
How you finishing up this hole?

405
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:44,188
Promise me
you'll take Whistler with you.

406
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,568
You making demands on me, huh?

407
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:56,075
I understand why you're going to kill me,
but he's done nothing wrong.

408
00:34:56,283 --> 00:34:58,535
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

409
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:00,704
Just take him with you.

410
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:04,291
You need him. He's the only one
who figured this all out.

411
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:08,587
Don't you worry,
I'll take care of your friend.

412
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:14,885
All right, first, you need to keep building
braces to support the tunnel as you go.

413
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:17,388
- How you do that?
- Whistler can show you how.

414
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:21,350
Look like you just make some
wood squares from these boxes here.

415
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:25,354
Like I said, Whistler can show you.

416
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,231
How much further to the surface?

417
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:29,692
Not far.

418
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:32,820
Can't be more than 10 feet.

419
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:39,326
Professor Blanco...

420
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:43,288
...too bad you won't be around
to enjoy it.

421
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,812
- Ooh!
- Aah!

422
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,037
How long is this gonna set us back?

423
00:36:24,204 --> 00:36:27,166
What's gonna is if the guards
are looking at a sinkhole...

424
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:29,668
...out in no man's land.

425
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:39,553
Michael?

426
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:52,149
We're good.

427
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:53,984
Yeah.

428
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:57,905
We're good.

429
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:31,021
Back in business.

430
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:33,774
- I'm in.
- For what? Getting your ass kicked?

431
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:36,318
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.

432
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:40,572
You're in, champ.

433
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:57,756
Okay, I want you to stay here.

434
00:37:57,965 --> 00:38:00,008
I gotta get something, all right?

435
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:01,885
Don't move.

436
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:24,241
- Can you get home from here?
- Yeah, I'm two blocks away.

437
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:27,869
If he doesn't take you, I will.

438
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,742
Here. Use this.

439
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:09,286
- Thanks.
- Right up there.

440
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:15,375
After all the times you wanted me
to prove I was a fisherman...

441
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:19,755
...I should've been asking
if you were a real engineer.

442
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:23,341
- That could be one of us buried there.
- I'll do better next time.

443
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:29,473
I'm gonna go back down
and try to salvage some braces.

444
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:31,725
Yeah. I'll go with you.

445
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,511
Never gets any easier.

446
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:31,493
All the side jobs I do in Sona
for three years, I save all my money.

447
00:40:31,701 --> 00:40:34,955
It's $173.

448
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:39,251
If you're really leaving, it's yours.

449
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:42,629
Take me with you, please.

450
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:44,798
I don't wanna be here anymore.

451
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:49,219
You don't want any part of this.

452
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:46,920
You got a plan
or we back to square one?

453
00:42:47,128 --> 00:42:48,213
I have a plan.

454
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:50,298
Good.
I got something cooking outside.

455
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:53,134
I'm not walking into a buzz saw again.

456
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:58,389
- How you doing with the animals here?
- Actually, it's starting to feel like home.

457
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,643
- Whistler pretending he's a fisherman?
- Why?

458
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:05,146
Sofia found a passport in one of his
apartments. Name's Gary Miller.

459
00:43:05,313 --> 00:43:07,023
- I'm shocked.
- The guy's a fraud.

460
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:09,734
As far as I know,
there ain't no fish in Scottsdale.

461
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,409
Well, if he's not a fisherman...

462
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,622
...what is he?
