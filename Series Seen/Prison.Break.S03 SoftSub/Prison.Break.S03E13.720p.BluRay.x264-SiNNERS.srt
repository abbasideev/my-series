1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:03,878
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:05,338
What are you doing?

3
00:00:05,546 --> 00:00:08,049
I have what you need,
and I'll give you the rest...

4
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:11,427
...after I know that Sofia, L.J.,
they're all safe.

5
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,185
My book.

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:20,645
My book.

7
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,104
Get up.

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,776
- What is this place?
- Where we're gonna make the exchange.

9
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,195
A warehouse five miles down the road.

10
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:31,280
Be there in 20 minutes with my son.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,699
They must've closed the roads
out of Panama.

12
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,951
Papa, what do we do?

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,078
Whistler pretending he's a fisherman?

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,121
If he's not a fisherman, what is he?

15
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:42,917
I don't care what he says. I don't know
anything about Michael Scofield.

16
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,254
Are you sure you don't wanna change
your story, Fernando?

17
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:49,590
I guess this is where I say goodbye.

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,845
Hey, my truck.

19
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,936
What are we gonna do now?

20
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,258
Hey, hey. No.

21
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,253
Do you have a cell phone? Uh...

22
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,641
I lost them. You need to pick me up.

23
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,226
Where are you?

24
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:12,691
Let me guess.

25
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,821
- If anything happens to him--
- That depends, doesn't it?

26
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,576
I'm at the warehouse like you said.
Where are you?

27
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,870
Chasing your buddy.
Where do you think I am?

28
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,372
Why don't you get back here?

29
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,832
I have L.J. and Sofia,
ready to do the exchange.

30
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,251
- I'll call you back.
- What?

31
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,129
- Plan's shot, she's there.
- All right, now what?

32
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,674
Well, took me two weeks
to hook up that warehouse.

33
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,426
- We'll figure something out.
- I can fix this. I was--

34
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:43,138
- You were calling them to pick you up.
- So no one else would get hurt.

35
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,268
You really think
I would put anyone's life at risk?

36
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,811
You already have.

37
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,080
I can't go back to Sona, Papa. I can't.

38
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,500
You're not going back to Sona.

39
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:42,281
No.

40
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,135
Okay, okay.

41
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,578
Do you want some more?

42
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,956
Or do you wanna tell me
where Michael Scofield is?

43
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,502
I don't know where he is.

44
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,305
You know,
the first day you started here...

45
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,974
...I knew there was something off
about you.

46
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,395
I guess I just know a con
when I see one.

47
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:58,273
Well, you'll get to be
employee of the month.

48
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,685
- I'm waiting.
- There's been a change in venue.

49
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,064
Oh, well, well, well. I finally get to talk
to the brains of the outfit.

50
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,941
We're at the Plaza de Francia.

51
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,694
So you're thinking public place,
safety in numbers.

52
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,362
Witnesses to protect you.

53
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,366
I'm thinking public place,
wanted men, police.

54
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,660
Lots of witnesses to identify you.

55
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:55,706
Plaza de Francia, 10 minutes.
Be alone.

56
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,584
Round everyone up.

57
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,767
It's anarchy in here. We gotta hide.

58
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,143
I gotta help him.

59
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:01,646
He's the most hated person.
We start rubbing elbows with him again--

60
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:02,898
He gave me a home.

61
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,734
He gave me third-degree burns.
He can go to hell.

62
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,360
I owe him this much.

63
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,906
You don't wanna help, then don't.

64
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,241
Get out of here.

65
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,461
Just a few more steps, patrón,
few more.

66
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:25,962
Then it's home sweet home.

67
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:38,642
Hey!

68
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,101
This is my house.

69
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:53,031
Whoa, whoa. Easy now.

70
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:54,699
Get out.

71
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,206
Come here right now.

72
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,124
Hurry.

73
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,685
- He's gonna get us killed.
- He's gonna get us out of here.

74
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,547
What can I get you?

75
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,007
Club soda.

76
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,269
You've been to Panama before?

77
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,522
First time.

78
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,191
What did you do back in the States?

79
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:18,450
I'm in sort of a transitional period
right now.

80
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,786
In between jobs.

81
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,997
Sorry to hear, huh?

82
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,292
Yeah, we've all been there.

83
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm sure something will come up
before long.

84
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:33,340
I'm hoping
it's right around the corner.

85
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:15,423
You're gonna give me some
real information on Michael Scofield.

86
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,717
Or it's gonna be your funeral.

87
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,512
I don't know where he is.

88
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,265
I don't know how to reach him,
I swear.

89
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,897
Well, which one is it gonna be, papi?

90
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:56,130
- Hello, Gretchen.
- Where's Whistler?

91
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:57,757
Over my right shoulder.

92
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:05,473
You know, you're the first
to ever break out of Sona.

93
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,600
Where are they?

94
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:11,855
Bring them out.

95
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:16,734
I've worked with a lot of intelligent
people in this business, but you...

96
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:19,445
Maybe you wouldn't have to worry
about the Company...

97
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,281
...if you were on their side.

98
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:22,782
They certainly pay well.

99
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,668
There they are.

100
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,212
Give me Whistler
and I will give you L.J.

101
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,679
Hey.

102
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:48,182
You move, you're dead.

103
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:53,688
- Wait for handoff.
- Roger that.

104
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,539
- What is he doing?
- I've lost him.

105
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:15,251
This is not the point of exchange.
Just a confirmation everyone's alive.

106
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,629
They're alive. Let's trade.

107
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:21,049
You'll get a call in five minutes
telling you where to go next.

108
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:24,802
And when the exchange is over
and L.J. is safe...

109
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,972
...you and I are gonna spend
some quality time.

110
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:33,311
When the exchange is over,
you better run for your life.

111
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,941
One more stop.

112
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,549
There's a storm
brewing out there in the yard.

113
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:29,510
You tell them come in,
I'm not scared.

114
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,596
Well, I am.

115
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,891
You might wanna put that down.

116
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,076
Now, Teodoro...

117
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,246
You're the last one
I expect to see at my side.

118
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:01,334
- I take offense, patrón.
- I've had many foot washes.

119
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:05,004
Many men have come in
with sheep's clothing...

120
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:08,007
- ...only to let the wolf come out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

121
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:13,054
I am not trying to hurt you.
I am trying to save you.

122
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:14,722
Save me?

123
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:16,349
I'm gonna die here.

124
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:19,435
Your life is in jeopardy
just being with me.

125
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,854
Not necessarily.

126
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,982
As I was being escorted
back inside today...

127
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,820
...one of the guards offered us a chance
to buy our freedom.

128
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:35,368
If a guard spoke to you, he was lying.
It's impossible, it can't happen.

129
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,703
Maybe you've been too busy dying
to notice...

130
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,664
...but there's a new colonel outside.

131
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,919
Little Susie Sona ain't playing
so hard to get no more. She has a price.

132
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:46,837
And we're gonna need some money.

133
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:48,714
No.

134
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:49,965
No.

135
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:53,803
Then you will die in here.

136
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,563
- Michael.
- The lobby of the Museum of Antiquities.

137
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,150
- Why?
- Because that's where Whistler is.

138
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,860
You're overthinking things.

139
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,737
I've seen it too many times before.

140
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:14,407
First plan goes to hell,
then you start tap dancing.

141
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:16,742
And trust me, it always ends badly.

142
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,245
You have five minutes.

143
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:37,179
Unbelievable.

144
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:41,976
You know what to do.

145
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,109
- What's so funny?
- You.

146
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,987
Thinking you're gonna
outsmart my uncle.

147
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,034
Walk.

148
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:13,299
Metal detectors. And here I thought
we were building a circle of trust.

149
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:16,010
Come to the southwest corner
of the first floor.

150
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:19,013
Fine. But that's it.

151
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,056
No more stops on your guided tour.

152
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:24,894
If I don't walk out of here with Whistler,
I'm gonna snap L.J.'s neck.

153
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:28,063
And, yes, I can do it.

154
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,443
Here we go.

155
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:36,989
- Is everyone in position?
- Roger that.

156
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,036
It's the last bottle of rum.

157
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,788
Goodbye, patrón.

158
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:47,875
How much did he want?

159
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:51,629
Fifty thousand.

160
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,882
No.

161
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,259
We're not in Tijuana
haggling over a blanket.

162
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,303
We're talking about your life.

163
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:05,017
Even if I could find the money,
who could I trust to bring it in?

164
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:11,690
There is one person.

165
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:18,864
How do you know James?

166
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:22,117
You're working my last nerve.
Move your ass.

167
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,586
Relax.

168
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,715
Everybody stays cool,
we will all walk out of here.

169
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:39,343
As soon as we get L.J.,
you get Whistler.

170
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:48,477
But L.J. comes to us first.

171
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,195
Go ahead.

172
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:00,155
L.J.

173
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,668
Thank God you're safe.

174
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,222
What about the coordinates?

175
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,182
You said first thing you would do...

176
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:30,769
...once you had Whistler
was to get the rest of the coordinates.

177
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,272
Is she serious?

178
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,237
I'll give her what she wants
when we get out of here.

179
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,575
- Darling, it's not safe. We need to go.
- I want to see them.

180
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,039
Sofia, come on.

181
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,792
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

182
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:57,045
- Sofia.
- You wrote those numbers on paper.

183
00:20:57,254 --> 00:21:00,048
Gave half at Sona,
promised to give the other half now.

184
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:03,427
- I know, we'll discuss it later. Come.
- Welcome to the real world.

185
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:06,930
I'm sick of jumping through hoops
to keep princess in a bubble. Go.

186
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:08,265
This is between us.

187
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:11,894
- Where are the coordinates, Susan?
- There are no coordinates.

188
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:25,824
Sofia.

189
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,039
Come on.

190
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,501
Sofia?

191
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:40,631
Sofia?

192
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:44,051
James, stop kidding yourself.
It's time to leave.

193
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:53,393
What the hell are you still doing here?

194
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,938
If I were you
and couldn't bring weapons inside...

195
00:21:56,146 --> 00:22:00,108
...I'd have agents at every exit ready
to shoot as soon as we stepped outside.

196
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:03,779
Well, then, it really doesn't matter
what exit you take, does it?

197
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:05,197
Gonna go out that door.

198
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:08,450
Maybe you should take that door.

199
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:13,497
Actually, that door is locked
in the event of an emergency.

200
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:16,333
- What emergency?
- This one.

201
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:26,218
We're all walking out of here.

202
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:29,554
Together.

203
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:42,109
That's very dramatic,
calling the cops on yourself.

204
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:44,069
You must really wanna go back
to Sona.

205
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:47,572
They're not looking for a con, Gretchen.
They're looking for a thief.

206
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:50,117
Whatever I told you,
it was always to protect you.

207
00:22:50,283 --> 00:22:53,829
Now, you'll understand
if you'll just let me explain.

208
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,974
All this because I knew
Michael Scofield?

209
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:17,269
- Tell me where he is.
- I don't know!

210
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,530
Even if I knew...

211
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:02,814
Yes?

212
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,902
All right.

213
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:09,821
It'll be here shortly.

214
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:16,912
And now that we have the money,
how do we get it to the guard?

215
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:20,457
We don't.

216
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:27,589
What do you mean,
we don't?

217
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:30,634
We were supposed to bribe the guard.
That was the plan.

218
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:41,019
This is the plan.

219
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,605
This is business.

220
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:46,274
You, of all people, should understand.

221
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,531
- Help me hold him down.
- What are you talking about?

222
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,033
Do it.

223
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:57,786
Do it!

224
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:00,956
Oh, Teodoro.

225
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:05,377
Teodoro, Teodoro, Teodoro.

226
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:09,631
It's just a matter of time anyway.

227
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:17,055
Well, from one thief to another...

228
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,186
...out of respect, make it quick.

229
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:30,318
If you don't fight me, I will.

230
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:45,917
Adiós, Norman.

231
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:35,800
Over here.

232
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:39,721
- What's the problem?
- I found this in his pocket.

233
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:43,516
Would you care to explain this?

234
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:46,519
I've got no idea what it is.

235
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,193
It's plastic. It's from the gift shop.
Now, if you'll excuse us.

236
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,322
- What?
- Stay where you are.

237
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,157
- Why?
- Where's your identification?

238
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:18,885
Sofia.

239
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:32,357
Sofia. Come on.

240
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:37,862
Dad. Dad, you can't do this.

241
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,156
You can't.
The cops are gonna ask questions.

242
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:43,034
- You've gotta go.
- I'm not going, I'm not leaving.

243
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:48,331
What are you gonna do, James?

244
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:52,502
You go back and you'll get arrested
and that won't do any of us any good.

245
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:59,926
I will kill you now
for what you've done to her.

246
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:01,761
Enough!

247
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,016
I did what I had to do
to get you out, period.

248
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,978
You remember what's at stake,
James.

249
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:13,231
We're moving.

250
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:45,680
- Stop the van. I can't leave her.
- She already left you.

251
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:49,851
- Dad.
- I'm not gonna leave her.

252
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:52,478
Dad, you've gotta go.
Hey, I'll stay with her.

253
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,939
I promise. You've gotta go.

254
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,484
Dad? Go. Go.

255
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,284
Hey, can I get some help?

256
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:09,746
Do you have everything?

257
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:12,206
Book is gone.

258
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,625
What do you mean, gone?

259
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:21,424
Is it true?

260
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:26,721
Lechero? He's...

261
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:28,931
He's really...

262
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:30,725
Yeah.

263
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,816
How do you want me
to give you this?

264
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:41,068
The guards,
they won't let me in anymore.

265
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:44,238
I only want what I asked for.

266
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:46,991
Hold on to the rest for a few days.

267
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:56,459
If you were to consider leaving
with all that...

268
00:29:56,626 --> 00:30:01,047
Well, I just want you to know,
I'd be very cross with you.

269
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:05,176
I've been known
to have a bit of a temper problem...

270
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:06,886
...when betrayed.

271
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:09,972
No.

272
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:13,976
A deal's a deal.
You've done so much for me.

273
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,686
You have my word.

274
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,691
Wait.

275
00:30:25,821 --> 00:30:27,114
No, no.

276
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:29,367
It's okay.

277
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,384
I'll wait for you.

278
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:18,708
You ready?

279
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,690
I'm all right.

280
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:52,366
Where is Michael Scofield?

281
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:56,245
Where is Michael Scofield?

282
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:33,157
If it's him,
you're gonna find out where they are.

283
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:34,867
Or I'm gonna answer it myself...

284
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:38,204
...so they can hear you scream
when I blow your head off.

285
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:50,966
- Hello?
- Sucre, thank God.

286
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:54,887
- When you didn't show up with boat--
- I'm really sorry about that, papi.

287
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:57,431
I got into a little bit of trouble here
at work.

288
00:32:57,598 --> 00:32:58,849
Are you all right?

289
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:02,937
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

290
00:33:03,437 --> 00:33:06,273
- You guys got L.J.?
- Yeah, he's fine.

291
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:10,069
- What about Linc? Is he okay?
- He's fine.

292
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,947
Are you sure you're all right?

293
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:14,615
I'm fine.

294
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:17,701
It all worked out.

295
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:22,289
I'm about to catch a bus, papi.
Take care.

296
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:30,923
Kill me if you want.

297
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:33,884
No, papi.

298
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:36,428
You're gonna wish we had.

299
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:51,485
Lechero is dead!

300
00:33:56,073 --> 00:33:58,450
Lechero is dead.

301
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,664
I come before you now
to bury the man.

302
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,085
Not to praise him.

303
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:12,798
Well, there's nothing praiseworthy
about his rule here.

304
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:17,219
Having one of our own dictate to us?

305
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:20,222
Well, that's just not the natural order.

306
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:24,435
All cons are equal.

307
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,228
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

308
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:36,614
I have the last remnants
of Lechero's cruel empire...

309
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,240
...in my hand.

310
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,580
An empire
which I willingly participated in...

311
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,416
...and witnessed firsthand.

312
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,837
Money.

313
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:57,509
Made of off your backs
and off the backs of your family.

314
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,013
It's yours.

315
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:05,142
And I'm here to tell you,
I'm giving it back.

316
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:14,693
I'm giving it back. I'm giving it back.

317
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:17,237
Giving it back.

318
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:39,760
Welcome home, papi.

319
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,512
- She's gonna be okay.
- Good.

320
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:34,982
Uncle Mike, um, I wanted to wait
until we were safe to do this.

321
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:40,737
But I found this in the room
where Sara and I were held.

322
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:45,033
I thought you might wanna have it.

323
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:14,563
I'm sorry.

324
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,069
Thanks.

325
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:25,490
How's Sofia doing?

326
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,117
- She's good.
- Good.

327
00:37:27,284 --> 00:37:28,744
Cops will be leaving soon.

328
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,663
- And you can go up and see her then.
- Good.

329
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,499
She wanted me to tell you something.

330
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,753
She said there's something
in her apartment underneath her bed.

331
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:40,797
- Something about Whistler.
- I'm not interested.

332
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:44,760
What is it?

333
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:48,180
Michael, this is over. It's done.

334
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,266
I said, what is it?

335
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:11,578
You're late.

336
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:16,083
And you owe him for my drinks.

337
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,836
Give us a minute.

338
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,014
That's a nice tip.

339
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,184
She handles the money.

340
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:42,609
You in?

341
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:46,238
She'd better be able to handle
a lot more than that.

342
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:50,575
Because if she has done
what you think she has...

343
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,744
Sara.

344
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:55,372
She's the weak link.

345
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:59,584
And he will find her.

346
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,838
And then Scofield will find you...

347
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:04,798
...and me.

348
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:10,470
- And I'm not paying for your mess.
- Are you in or are you out?

349
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:17,477
I'm in.

350
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:49,009
- Linc?
- Yeah?

351
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:50,302
I need your gun.

352
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:53,763
Thanks.

353
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,609
Jason Lief.

354
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:08,445
You heard of this guy?

355
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,660
No. If he's important to Whistler,
he's important to me.

356
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:18,204
- Whoa, slow down.
- I get to Whistler, I get to Gretchen.

357
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:21,625
No. This is the one chance you,
me and L.J. have of sticking together.

358
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,085
They killed Sara, Linc.

359
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:32,719
I'm sorry about that.

360
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:34,971
I know.

361
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:36,264
Listen, man, I...

362
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:38,350
I did everything I could, you know.

363
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,686
- Everything.
- I know you did.

364
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,441
But I gotta go.

365
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,292
Thanks.
