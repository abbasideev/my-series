1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:04,003
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,838
We're losing the light. Go back.

3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,470
You, is that your cell?

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,854
You are breaking out of this prison,
Mr. Scofield.

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,314
You're taking me with you.

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:27,944
So with this deal, what specifically
are they expecting from me?

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,612
They need to know everything.

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,241
They wanna confirm that you
have viable incriminating information.

9
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:35,034
You can be a cooperative witness.

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,285
Show me the pictures.

11
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,621
I can't show you the pictures, man.

12
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,498
She's dead, Michael.

13
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,418
I thought we agreed
it was best for you to not come.

14
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,379
I need to know
how this is gonna affect things.

15
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:47,755
Four more days.

16
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,175
If I'm out of here by then,
I can still do it.

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,886
I'll let the brothers know.

18
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,164
Michael.

19
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:26,627
- You like this?
- Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,129
It's a special occasion.

21
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:31,799
My dad's coming today, so I'm just
gonna wait here till he shows up.

22
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,721
- You look sharp.
- Thanks.

23
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,973
Scofield, you have a visitor.

24
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,149
- L.J., is he--?
- Alive.

25
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,070
- They've given us four more days.
- Okay, good.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,949
Back at the exchange point,
I saw three body bags.

27
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:00,786
You, me and L.J.,
we weren't getting out of there alive.

28
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,207
That's the last time
I get caught flatfooted.

29
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,086
Then do what you gotta do, Linc.

30
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,089
As long as I take care of my end,
right?

31
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,842
Michael, I know you're angry at me
about Sara, but--

32
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,179
- You lied.
- I had to lie.

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,018
Your son is my nephew.

34
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,438
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

35
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,650
But apparently...

36
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,570
Apparently, you think I only care
about myself.

37
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:37,907
I know you don't care about yourself,
but you cared about Sara.

38
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:40,701
You loved her, and I'm sorry.

39
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:44,038
But L.J. is my son.
I couldn't let anything happen to him.

40
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,956
You know that.

41
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:48,417
You used me, Linc.

42
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,547
So I guess you and the Company
have something in common.

43
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,057
I don't know where he is.
I have tried every number I have.

44
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,644
Well, listen,
I'll check back with headquarters...

45
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,896
...and see what they say.

46
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:13,567
Never mind. I found him.

47
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,618
Carter Blue Label.

48
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:27,790
You always had such high-end taste
for a girl from Wheeling.

49
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:29,959
Since I paid for it.

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,420
You know how much
I hate to travel, Gretchen?

51
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:39,677
But considering the mess down here,
I made an exception.

52
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:43,430
- It was a mess before I got here.
- And it's time to clean it up.

53
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:46,100
We're ending this today.

54
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,062
Ah.

55
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,898
Bang and burn.

56
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:59,029
General, that was analyzed.
What you're asking for is too dangerous.

57
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:02,324
Not to mention next to impossible
with the given time frame.

58
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:06,870
I remember a substantial wire transfer
to an offshore account...

59
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,790
...that took the word "impossible"
out of the equation.

60
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:15,004
Or tell me,
did I hire the wrong person?

61
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:20,134
I am doing my job
when I tell you to seriously reconsider.

62
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:24,013
And now I have to do my job.

63
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,310
I don't pay you to be my advisor.
You're my operative.

64
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:33,772
You have your instructions.
Now, get it done.

65
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,402
Because if you don't, I'll make
what happened to you in Mosul...

66
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,030
...feel like a massage.

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,493
This was a big mistake, Gretchen.

68
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,204
Can't make a habit
of coming to Sona.

69
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,456
I won't.

70
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:53,333
Because we're going with
the bang and burn.

71
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,754
That's suicide.

72
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,715
We have more time.

73
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:02,384
My boss wants things to move
a bit faster.

74
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:04,344
Well, tell him you can't pull it off.

75
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,973
- I might get killed if we do this.
- And I might get killed if we don't.

76
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,769
Between you and me,
who do you think I care about more?

77
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:16,315
Look at me, James.
See if you can tell how serious I am.

78
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,778
If you don't play ball,
I will leave you in Sona to rot.

79
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,988
I promise.

80
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,991
Be ready by 5.
That's when it happens.

81
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,702
Everybody goes.

82
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,120
What about Scofield?

83
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,248
Kill him.

84
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,063
You know the consequences
if I'm seen talking to you?

85
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,983
The military's reinforcing the bars
on all the windows.

86
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:44,444
Can you talk to the colonel?
Get him to postpone that?

87
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,823
After your performance yesterday,
I have no sway with the colonel.

88
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,369
I'm afraid you've brokered your way
into an escape plan that no longer exists.

89
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:55,872
I have an idea.

90
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,958
Lechero.

91
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,751
Wait here for me.

92
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,296
What?

93
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:10,470
Some of the men don't feel the need
to pay their debts anymore.

94
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,849
It's been one week, man,
and we lost three men.

95
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:17,728
Now, if we gonna keep Sona,
we're gonna need numbers.

96
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,772
I don't trust nobody here, Norino.
Especially now.

97
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,360
I'll work with the men I have.

98
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,487
Really, brother?

99
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:30,449
You, me and the gimp over there,
we gonna run this place?

100
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,577
I wanna bring on Cristobal.

101
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,331
He's solid, man.
One of them Darrien ghetto boys.

102
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,046
Bring him over.

103
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,591
But I promise you nothing.

104
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:55,474
Find me anything that can sustain
heavy RPGs and small arms.

105
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,142
A Cougar, a Stryker.

106
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,103
Not gonna happen. We do have a call
into a Sergeant York--

107
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,772
Yeah, that's not gonna cut it.

108
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:05,275
Call Suezamel, put him on standby.
Tell him we might need him.

109
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,485
Is there a problem?

110
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:09,321
- We're doing this at 5:00?
- We can wait until tonight...

111
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:13,408
...when our guys are moving too fast for
night vision to work. You can tag along.

112
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,118
Get it done.

113
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:39,226
Hello?

114
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:42,938
Yes, I'm trying to
locate the family of Mr. James Whistler.

115
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,651
I am his--
I'm his wife. Who's calling?

116
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,238
My name's Tommy Day. I own
the apartment Mr. Whistler rents from.

117
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:54,115
There's a busted pipe in his unit
that's caused damage...

118
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:55,742
...to the apartment next door.

119
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:01,081
I'm sorry, I think you have confused
James with someone else.

120
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,124
He's not renting another apartment.

121
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,794
Oh, I assure you,
Mr. Whistler's my tenant.

122
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,505
I couldn't find anyone
after his conviction.

123
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:13,343
But I checked his phone bill. There
were numerous calls to this number.

124
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,303
If you could come to the apartment...

125
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,684
...the address is 40 Abel Bravo
in Obarrio, Unit 4.

126
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,730
Tell your men the lntel says...

127
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,774
...the Panamanians have no access
to SAM.

128
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:33,405
- Yeah?
- There's been a development.

129
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,718
Hey. The Company's giving us
four more days.

130
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,180
- Okay.
- Problem is, I...

131
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:01,433
I don't know
how we're getting out of here.

132
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,979
Lechero might have some ideas,
but I'm still waiting to hear from him.

133
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:11,860
- I'm sorry, is this a bad time for you?
- It's been an intense 24 hours.

134
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,237
- I have things on my mind.
- Yeah?

135
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,614
Like your last trip to visitation,
maybe?

136
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:19,075
What, you're a spy now?

137
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:22,996
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but she didn't
strike me as the girlfriend type.

138
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,748
She was Company.

139
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:28,543
After your failed escape, she came
to remind me I have a stake in this too.

140
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,670
Which you seem to have forgotten.

141
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,131
So forgive me if I don't jump for joy...

142
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:36,801
...when you say you're working
on a plan that may very well fail again.

143
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:42,974
I gotta get out of here and it's getting
to the point where I don't care how.

144
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,857
Got what we talked about?

145
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,194
You never met me.

146
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,207
Enough.

147
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,626
Shales. Shales.

148
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:19,010
Oh, my God.
What the hell is going on?

149
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:22,138
- Shales.
- What about Oscar Shales?

150
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:26,101
He raped, killed and tortured.

151
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:30,063
I couldn't turn him over
to some scumbag lawyer...

152
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,235
...who was just gonna get him off or--
Couldn't. No. No, I just--

153
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,571
So I killed him.

154
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,869
And I felt good.

155
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,876
I felt-- I felt really good.

156
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:57,882
But then, there came the visions
of Shales begging for his life.

157
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,592
And I couldn't get rid of them.

158
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,097
So I got these drugs
that kept me on an even keel.

159
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,226
And then when I got to Sona,
I couldn't get my pills.

160
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,812
So I had to...

161
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:14,858
...improvise.

162
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,240
Did you want me
to get drugs for you?

163
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:28,204
I assume that whoever set this up
must think that I might have some value.

164
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,917
That's why you came back for me.

165
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:40,425
I came here to help a man that
I respect and care about.

166
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,512
I appreciate that.

167
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,809
But I can't testify like this.

168
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,772
Please?

169
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,068
Please?

170
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,037
One-inch reinforced steel
on every window.

171
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,623
I don't think
we're getting through those.

172
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,166
I'll figure something out.

173
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,752
I know you will.

174
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:19,172
Listen, man, I'm sorry about before.

175
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,384
Like I said, things have been intense.
So much depends on this working out.

176
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,845
My nephew's life
depends on this working.

177
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,848
I know it does.
I never asked, how old is he?

178
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:33,102
- Sixteen.
- Oh, hell.

179
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,563
Knock, knock.

180
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,191
What do you want?

181
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,819
Me? I just came by
to slip something in your mail slot.

182
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:45,865
It's from EI Patron himself,
but it was meant for your eyes only.

183
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,575
Grabby.

184
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:50,578
It don't look like no invitation
to the Sona-Hawkins Dance.

185
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:54,791
- What do you got cooking with Lechero?
- It's none of your business, Theodore.

186
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,753
You wanna keep secrets? You wanna
treat me like a pesky insect? Fine.

187
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,922
Just remember, information,
like crumbs...

188
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,050
...always trickles down
to the vermin on the floor.

189
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,602
Four o'clock?

190
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:19,065
It's a sketch of Lechero's quarters.

191
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,913
To be honest, when a tenant pays
a year's rent in advance...

192
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,498
...and then gets locked up...

193
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:38,167
...I normally rent the place out
and double my money.

194
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:41,629
But James was a good man.

195
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,382
I was hoping things
will turn out well for him.

196
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:50,054
Look, uh, miss.

197
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:53,683
A lot of guys
have a little something on the side.

198
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,102
This apartment,
whoever he brought here...

199
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,229
...doesn't mean he didn't love you.

200
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:04,193
You said you have
James' insurance papers?

201
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,239
Right on, right on. I'll go get them.

202
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:48,321
There's another door in here.

203
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,663
Forty-four thirteen.

204
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,394
Forty-four thirteen, huh?

205
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:32,740
- What about Scofield?
- Kill him.

206
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,743
You know,
if Lechero didn't send this...

207
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,746
...T-Bag might be setting me up
for someone.

208
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,748
What do you say we get out of here?

209
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,751
I'm truly sorry you got caught up
in my troubles, Michael.

210
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,017
Scofield?

211
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:05,815
- I take it there's another code.
- And I'm the only one who knows it.

212
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:09,985
For a man who likes secrets, using T-Bag
might not be the smartest move.

213
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:12,613
By the time he figures it out,
we'll be long gone.

214
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,533
Sammy's on his way back, let's go.

215
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,471
What the hell is this?

216
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:39,598
Underground tunnel.

217
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,478
The old administration used it
to travel between Cell Blocks A and B.

218
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,983
After the riots,
they moved us all to B.

219
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,863
And then the soldiers came in,
blew this tunnel up.

220
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:06,834
Looks like someone already
tried to get through the debris.

221
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:10,171
Well, I never planned to spend
my whole life in Sona.

222
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:12,464
Just didn't expect it to end so soon.

223
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:16,802
You're the engineer, though, right?
You can dig our way out of this?

224
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:19,889
Yeah, we need a couple of Payloaders.

225
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:23,100
No, now, you listen.
You're gonna dig out of this place.

226
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:28,564
We're not digging out.
But we might be digging up.

227
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,453
Hello, Sofia.

228
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,623
Hello. Who are you?

229
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,709
A friend of James. Old friend.

230
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,587
Well, he isn't here.

231
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,757
I know where he is.

232
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:03,974
I can see why James loves you.
You are beautiful.

233
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:07,061
But if you keep sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong...

234
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:10,064
...I'm gonna make him miss you
very, very much.

235
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,816
Do you understand what I'm saying
to you?

236
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:16,028
Good.

237
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:19,990
You don't need to worry about this.

238
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:23,744
Now, listen very carefully to me, Sofia,
and you won't get hurt.

239
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:28,123
I want you to go home, do your hair,
and paint your nails and get all ready...

240
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,875
...for when James comes home.

241
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:33,337
- You two will live happily ever after.
- What do you want from him?

242
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,966
See, you're not listening already.

243
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:42,471
Don't get in the way or I promise you,
things will get very bad for you.

244
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,270
You are truly beautiful.

245
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:55,901
I hope you can stay that way.

246
00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:00,072
Get the hell out of here.

247
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:17,464
All right. If we get through the ceiling,
foundation and earth on top of that...

248
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,800
...we can make it to middle
of no-man's-land.

249
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,469
We maybe hit the fence
before we get shot.

250
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:24,471
Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want that.

251
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,932
Yes, but you can dig out though,
right?

252
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,726
Based on gravity and the sand
that Sona's built on...

253
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:33,730
...we're gonna need some kind of
support brace for the tunnel, or...

254
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,441
Or what?

255
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,735
Or the whole thing collapses
and we're buried alive.

256
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:47,411
Go ahead and relax, huh?
I'll get some rum.

257
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:52,332
- How long will it take?
- Maybe two days.

258
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:55,335
I gotta get upstairs
and estimate where in no-man's-land...

259
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,671
...that tunnel's gonna let out.

260
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,388
Where you going? I'm meditating.

261
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,974
I was just getting rum
for Cristobal and his boys.

262
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:10,726
Rum? His boys?

263
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,521
No, I said I'd meet with Cristobal.
Not every half-breed in Sona.

264
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,232
- All right, well, they're up there now.
- Let's go.

265
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,276
- Let me just get some rum, man.
- No.

266
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,777
They drink beer like everyone else.

267
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:22,237
Look, man.

268
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:25,240
I offered them something good.
Don't make me look the fool.

269
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,368
The rum is for me, Sammy.

270
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:31,496
Now, you have a problem with that?

271
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:40,172
- No, sir.
- Good. Let's go.

272
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,304
Let's get back to work.

273
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,770
Hey, only Lechero has the code.

274
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,230
We don't need a code.

275
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:04,446
Get inside before Sammy comes back.

276
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:12,079
Alex.

277
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,044
Where's Agent Lang?

278
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:21,046
Agent-- I don't know.

279
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:23,799
What--? What the hell's wrong with you?
What's going on?

280
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:28,595
I think I have a right to be nervous.
My life is on the line, you know.

281
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:30,097
What are you talking about?

282
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,766
You have given live press conferences
your entire life.

283
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,561
I've seen you many times, you're an old
pro. Now splash water on your face.

284
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,855
- The panel wants us there right now.
- What?

285
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:43,360
Get dressed. Or would you rather
have me drag your ass back to Sona?

286
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,697
Water on the face. Get your suit on.
We're going.

287
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:53,704
Yeah, it's Sullins.
We're almost ready to move here.

288
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,416
Where the hell is Lang? No.

289
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,584
Where we at?

290
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,837
- Everything's in place.
- Good.

291
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:05,590
We've done our part. Now it's time
for Whistler to step up and do his.

292
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:08,927
Come 5:00, he better be ready.

293
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:13,557
Three feet of concrete and rebar,
plus 10 feet of dirt and sand...

294
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:15,183
...before we see sky.

295
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,313
Are you all right?

296
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,611
To be completely honest, no.
Not really.

297
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:30,699
- I have this thing for confined spaces.
- You're telling me you're claustrophobic?

298
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:33,827
Ever since I was a boy. Um...

299
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:36,997
- I need to be upstairs.
- That's not really an option right now.

300
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:39,875
Staying here is not really an option
for me either.

301
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:43,587
- I suggest you get yourself together.
- I just need some air.

302
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:50,719
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- I need to get out of here, I need air.

303
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,889
You walk through that door,
you'll never need air again.

304
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:57,559
You don't understand.
I need to get out of here now.

305
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:01,021
What's really going on here?
Why do you keep looking at your watch?

306
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,273
What are you really up to?

307
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:07,152
Scofield, the men are gone,
let's move.

308
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:16,161
- I need your phone.
- Sammy's on his way.

309
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:19,456
- I have to call my brother.
- The phone stays with me. Get out.

310
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,297
Oh, just so that we're clear, she's got
no electricity and no running water.

311
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:30,717
Septic's out too,
but there's an outhouse in the woods.

312
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:32,677
It's perfect.
A hundred bucks a month.

313
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:35,847
- Two hundred.
- A hundred bucks a month.

314
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,725
Deal.

315
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:41,353
But I don't want growing no drugs
on the land.

316
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,604
No marijuana.

317
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:45,106
You got that?

318
00:24:52,864 --> 00:24:55,450
- Welcome home, my friend.
- Thanks.

319
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,206
Listen, if you wanna get out of here,
I get it and Michael would too.

320
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,416
You've done more than enough.

321
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,336
If I had a kid
in the same situation as your son...

322
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:08,672
...would you and your brother
walk out on me?

323
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:10,340
Yeah.

324
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,510
Here, this is good. Put it down there.

325
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,639
Okay, hold on.

326
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:21,559
- You ready?
- Yeah.

327
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:28,191
I hope this works, papi.

328
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:32,112
All right, let's go.

329
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:37,158
McGrady.

330
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:41,788
I need your help.

331
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,249
Not now, bro. My father got here,
I'm gonna see him.

332
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,960
Actually, I need his help too.

333
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:52,298
- What you want from my old man?
- Someone to deliver a message outside.

334
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:54,676
- Someone I can trust.
- Hell, no.

335
00:25:55,677 --> 00:25:57,971
My papa don't get into trouble
like you do.

336
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:00,223
- It's not trouble, just a phone call.
- No.

337
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,602
- I love my father.
- And I love my brother.

338
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:08,148
If he doesn't get this message,
something's gonna happen to him.

339
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:11,276
Look, something really bad is going on.
Please.

340
00:26:17,574 --> 00:26:20,952
- Hello, son.
- Papa.

341
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,873
You look very handsome.
Like your school picture.

342
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,753
I cleaned a guy's cell for this shirt.

343
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:33,131
- You should be in school now.
- It's okay, Papa.

344
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:34,507
With your friends.

345
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:40,346
Papa, please don't get upset.
I have friends in here.

346
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,560
- The American?
- Yes. He's nice.

347
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:48,646
He keeps his word.
It's very rare in Sona.

348
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:52,150
And, uh, he needs my help.

349
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:56,404
Thank God you're here.

350
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:59,991
I thought you might have come earlier
just to make sure I was okay.

351
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:03,161
I read the newspaper.
I knew you were safe.

352
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,248
I am, for now. But you might not be.

353
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,292
Now, listen to me carefully.

354
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:12,795
Promise me you won't go near
Lincoln Burrows today.

355
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:15,006
- Lincoln?
- Too dangerous to be around him.

356
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:19,886
To be with him, to be near him.
Just go home and stay there.

357
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,263
And I will call you tonight.

358
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:26,100
That's all I can say.
Do you understand?

359
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:29,145
- Call me? From where?
- Do you understand me?

360
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,940
- Yeah.
- Promise me.

361
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,358
Say it out loud.

362
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,652
I promise.

363
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,363
Why are you so scared?

364
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:41,574
Because I can't have you get hurt.

365
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,872
Because I love you
more than anything in the world.

366
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:51,209
Do you?

367
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:53,962
Yeah.

368
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:59,550
James, I got a call today from a man
who says he's your landlord.

369
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:03,513
Talking about another apartment.

370
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:05,974
Should I call him back?

371
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,435
- Must have been a wrong number.
- He asked for you by name.

372
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:11,145
The man is clearly confused.

373
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:13,481
I don't know anything
about another apartment.

374
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:18,695
Sofia, all I know is that
you've gotta stay away from Lincoln.

375
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:21,239
Please.

376
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:23,992
Okay, James.

377
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:26,577
I'll wait for your call.

378
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:34,127
Here.

379
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,212
I have this.

380
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:38,256
I don't wanna see it.

381
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:41,509
I'll put it with the others.

382
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:45,430
I'm not coming home. Accept that.

383
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,311
You should go.

384
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:56,024
Make that call for my friend.

385
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:02,739
Happy birthday, son.

386
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:18,046
Maybe we should pick up some locks,
secure the house.

387
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:21,007
We can't have anything new on it.
The place needs to look abandoned.

388
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,219
Yeah?

389
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:26,721
I have a message for you.

390
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:28,264
Don't come home for dinner.

391
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:29,474
Who is this?

392
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,227
I'm supposed to tell you,
don't come home for dinner.

393
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,188
What?

394
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:37,523
When me and Mikey were kids,
we had a code...

395
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,735
...when Social Services
were trying to get me into juvie.

396
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:43,237
He's telling me to watch my back.

397
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:51,412
- What are you doing here?
- Why haven't you returned my calls?

398
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:55,500
- You have him?
- Yeah, he just arrived back at his hotel.

399
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:57,502
But Whistler's girl tracked him down.

400
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:00,546
And she's talking to Lincoln
and the Mexican.

401
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:03,549
After what she saw today,
she could be complicating things.

402
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:06,469
- You have a directive?
- I warned her.

403
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:09,013
- Take them all out.
- What will Whistler say?

404
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,974
I said take them all out.

405
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:21,108
I don't care about your
boyfriend's apartment. I just don't care.

406
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:23,611
No, I went there
and a woman showed up.

407
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,322
She threatened me.
She knows James.

408
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,951
- Susan.
- What, you know her?

409
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:31,827
She's the one who has L.J.

410
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:37,250
She took something I found.
A passport.

411
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:41,587
It had James' picture and birthday.
But his name said Gary Miller.

412
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:43,965
- I don't know what's going on.
- I'll tell you.

413
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:46,801
Your boyfriend's a liar.
I told you that from the start.

414
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:50,721
James told me to stay away from you
today. That it was dangerous.

415
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,265
Let's go.

416
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:08,864
I need to speak to Michael Scofield.
I'm his brother.

417
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,326
How you get this number?

418
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:16,706
He called me two days back.
I didn't answer.

419
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:19,041
But listen,
I need to speak to him now.

420
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,634
Where we going?

421
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:30,261
Let's go.

422
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:34,598
You never guess who that was.
Michael Scofield's brother.

423
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:39,895
Who calls me and who I call
is my business.

424
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,903
- Where's your friends?
- I don't know.

425
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,906
- Where's your friends?
- I don't know, please don't shoot.

426
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:52,658
Please.

427
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:53,909
Drop it.

428
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:55,411
Why you coming after us?

429
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:18,267
Different day, same problem, huh?
You know how this turned out...

430
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:21,937
...when L.J. was in this position
and today is no different.

431
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:25,691
So be a good boy
and put down the gun.

432
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:31,155
Come on, Linc.
I know you learned your lesson.

433
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,288
You're right. I have.

434
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:58,516
For the record,
this is an international hearing...

435
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:00,976
...requested by
the United States government...

436
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:06,565
...for the purpose of hearing testimony
from one Mr. Alexander Mahone.

437
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:11,028
- You gotta be kidding me.
- So, Mr. Mahone...

438
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:13,364
...when were you first contacted
by anyone...

439
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:16,659
...from the group
referred to as the Company?

440
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:23,707
Now, they told me that if I didn't kill
every one of the Fox River Eight...

441
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,209
...they would come after me.

442
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:29,213
They had all worked
with Scofield on the escape...

443
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,715
...so the Company wasn't sure
what they knew--

444
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:35,261
Mr. Mahone, I'm gonna ask
you to please keep your answer...

445
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:36,762
...related to the question.

446
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:40,933
Related? It's all connected--
It's just-- It's-- It's a web.

447
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,479
And it's a web that I got caught in,
and Lincoln Burrows got caught in...

448
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:47,481
...and Michael Scofield got caught in.

449
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:51,026
- If I may, I think what Agent Mahone--
- We're all just like flies.

450
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:52,861
- Is trying to say--
- Thank you...

451
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:55,406
...but we're here
to hear from Mr. Mahone.

452
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,116
Now, we're gonna try this again.

453
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:01,370
When were you first contacted
by the Company?

454
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,873
I cannot say.

455
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,627
You know,
they could be in contact with you...

456
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:12,548
...or you could be in contact with
them, and you'd never know, it's--

457
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:16,427
They could be in contact with us
right now.

458
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:20,014
I mean, it's-- It sounds crazy, right?
It's cra--

459
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,727
And-- And it would be, except
for the simple fact that it's true.

460
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:27,771
The government
that I had dedicated my life to...

461
00:34:27,938 --> 00:34:32,359
...manipulated and extorted me
and blackmailed me...

462
00:34:34,236 --> 00:34:36,697
...so that I would kill for them.

463
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:39,700
And I did the things
that they made me do...

464
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:42,661
...so I could protect my family.

465
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:47,416
And so...

466
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:52,171
I would like to go home.

467
00:34:56,675 --> 00:34:59,094
So can I do that, please?

468
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:05,225
Hey.

469
00:35:06,894 --> 00:35:08,187
Where have you been?

470
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:11,648
I came looking for scrap metal
for the support brace for the tunnel.

471
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:13,067
Really?

472
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,612
Looks like a tight squeeze up there.

473
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:20,199
You sure there's enough air
or does the claustrophobia come and go?

474
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:23,911
What's it like going through life
always distrustful?

475
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:25,371
You tell me, James.

476
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,831
Hate to break up the brouhaha,
gentlemen...

477
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:30,042
...but Lechero would like to see you.

478
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:32,628
Says it has something to do
with your big brother.

479
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:47,768
Give us moment, will you, Teodoro?

480
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:03,492
If your brother should ever call
my cell phone again...

481
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,203
...you tell him
you're the one that's gonna pay.

482
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:21,677
- Yeah?
- You got the message?

483
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:23,887
You were right.
They tried to take us out.

484
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:26,431
I know. Whistler got
a visitor from the Company.

485
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:29,977
He's been acting strange ever since.
I'm telling you, something's up.

486
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:34,189
More than acting strange. He told Sofia
not to be near me, it was dangerous.

487
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:37,317
The Company's coming after us.

488
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,113
They don't need us anymore.

489
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,907
Here we go.

490
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:47,202
They're breaking him out
on their own.

491
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:56,086
We're 100 yards from the target.

492
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:58,839
Keep your eyes open.
Let's get in and out fast.

493
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,051
Come on.

494
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:13,270
Damn.

495
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:33,498
Come on! Come on, keep it coming!

496
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:37,085
- Come on.
- Hey.

497
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:00,650
Come on.

498
00:38:09,242 --> 00:38:10,952
Fly it. Go, go, go.

499
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,122
I have two on the line.
Repeat, two men on the line.

500
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,501
Move it, move it, move it.

501
00:38:30,263 --> 00:38:31,932
Chopper 1, depart with both inmates.

502
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,975
We can't. We're taking too much fire.

503
00:38:35,227 --> 00:38:36,353
Can 't get a clean shot.

504
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:39,731
I'm getting lower. Take them out.

505
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,319
Stay on them. Stay on them.

506
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,074
Give us some covering fire.

507
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:52,035
Fire, go, fire, fire, fire.

508
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,750
Man down. Man down.

509
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:00,710
Let go, you son of a bitch.

510
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:07,050
We're losing him.

511
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:13,265
We lost Whistler. Abort, abort.

512
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:16,643
Mission failed.
Return to Base 1 immediately.

513
00:40:48,526 --> 00:40:52,614
Alex, I'm so sorry.

514
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:55,784
I'm gonna have to take you back
to Sona.

515
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:34,656
You, get up.

516
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,334
Mr. Scofield.

517
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:50,380
There have been two escape attempts
in the past two days.

518
00:41:50,547 --> 00:41:52,882
Somehow, I don't think
it's a coincidence...

519
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:55,969
...that you arrived
shortly before they happened.

520
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,180
I had nothing to do with that.

521
00:42:03,184 --> 00:42:05,937
You've caused too many problems
here in Sona.

522
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:09,482
So maybe you shouldn't be here
in Sona.

523
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:17,699
Say goodbye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
