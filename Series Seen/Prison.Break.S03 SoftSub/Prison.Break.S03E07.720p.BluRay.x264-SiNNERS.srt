1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:03,653
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,030
Found a cell that'll get us
to no man's land.

3
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,741
- Who lives there?
- Papo, Cheo and Sammy.

4
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:11,327
We're gonna have to disable
two tower guards.

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,080
I've taken care of one.
The other, we need help.

6
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,375
Between 1 and 2, he takes
his break. He gets a cup of coffee.

7
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,294
We need to find out where
and put something in that cup.

8
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,130
Make sure he's unconscious.

9
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,882
- Three-thirteen?
- Three-thirteen is when it starts.

10
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,845
The exchange point. Everything goes
as planned, you'll have your son back.

11
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:30,138
I came to get you out?

12
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:35,143
The Justice Department is motivated
to get to the bottom of this business.

13
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:37,103
Guard will be asleep in half hour.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,938
- So we're good.
- Not quite.

15
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:40,398
She's dead, Michael.

16
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,942
I lied to you. I'm sorry, but...

17
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:44,235
This is your fault.

18
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,737
- Just think about what you're doing.
- I have.

19
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:07,425
Explain something to me, blanco.

20
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,760
One minute you plead
for your friend's life...

21
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:11,929
...and the next minute
you wanna take it?

22
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,180
This man...

23
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:15,182
This man is no friend of mine!

24
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,269
- What happened to your girlfriend has--
- Her name was Sara!

25
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:21,814
And she was a good person.

26
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:26,527
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

27
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:29,614
So it's revenge, eh, boy?
An eye for an eye.

28
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:32,742
Once you make such a declaration,
there's no going back.

29
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,786
There's nothing to go back to.

30
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,457
Good. Then we have a fight.

31
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,213
Now, both of you,
go and assign your belongings...

32
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,341
...and pray to whatever god is yours.

33
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,092
We come back here in 15 minutes.

34
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,556
Fight, fight, fight!

35
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:36,889
Hey.

36
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,559
- You need any more help?
- You've done more than enough.

37
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,437
Here, take that. Not a lot,
enough to get you started.

38
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:46,607
No, no, I can't take this.
I did this because I wanted to help.

39
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:48,984
Hey, buy a car, get a bus ticket.

40
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:51,904
- Do whatever. Just get out of here.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,824
I'm gonna get some gas, okay?
I'll meet you in the front.

42
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:56,117
All right.

43
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,087
She coming with you
to do the exchange?

44
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,296
Yeah.

45
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:12,591
Is that a good idea? What if
something goes wrong, she gets hurt?

46
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:15,469
Incentive in case Whistler
doesn't wanna go quietly.

47
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,430
You think this is gonna go down quiet?

48
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,932
They're just gonna give you L.J.
just like that?

49
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,435
Doesn't matter. I know
what they're capable of.

50
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,104
I ain't gonna gamble
with my son's life.

51
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,731
Well, maybe you don't have to.

52
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:29,900
Alex.

53
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:32,862
Alex.

54
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:35,823
Yeah?

55
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:39,243
We'll be arriving at the courthouse
in about 15 minutes.

56
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,911
The hearing will begin shortly.

57
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,914
All in all, this whole thing
will be done within the hour.

58
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,124
Good.

59
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:48,669
That sounds good.

60
00:03:54,425 --> 00:04:00,431
So with this deal, what specifically
are they expecting from me?

61
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,225
They need to know everything.

62
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,811
About the president,
about the Company.

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,190
They wanna confirm that you have
viable incriminating information.

64
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:11,609
And that you can be
a cooperative witness.

65
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,944
If I cooperate fully...

66
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:18,574
...I won't be just incriminating them.

67
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:21,911
You're worried about all those skeletons
in your closet.

68
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,829
But you have full immunity.

69
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:27,374
Everything will be fine.
All you have to do is tell the truth.

70
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,959
Just stay calm.

71
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,351
Better knuckle up.

72
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,656
I don't know what you're thinking.

73
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:01,075
- Killing me's not gonna solve problems.
- Relax.

74
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,911
- I'm not gonna kill you.
- Then what was all that about?

75
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:07,081
You wanna make it out without
being seen, you need a diversion.

76
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,124
- Now we have one.
- You're off your head.

77
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,960
- They're waiting--
- Don't have time, it's almost 3:00.

78
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,296
That means
the guard should be drugged by now.

79
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,924
At 3:13, the sun's gonna hit
the other guard tower.

80
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:20,094
We'll have the cover we need.
It's now or never.

81
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:22,971
Listen, Michael, I...

82
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,141
I meant what I said about Sara.

83
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,144
If I were you, I wouldn't mention that.
We're getting out.

84
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:31,146
Then I'm trading you for my nephew.

85
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:34,983
And I'm gonna find out
who's responsible for taking her life.

86
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,235
And I'm taking theirs.

87
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,119
- Listen, Scofield.
- Not now.

88
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,246
Just please.

89
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,166
I heard you out there in the yard.

90
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,335
Is it true? About Sara?

91
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:20,547
- Yes.
- That's not--

92
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,007
I mean, it's--

93
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,717
What she...

94
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,636
I'm sorry, Michael.

95
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,429
I mean it.

96
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,973
She was a good person.

97
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,476
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:54,998
Is something wrong?

99
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:57,626
If anyone asks, tell them
your fuel pump's leaking.

100
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:01,088
- No, I'm going to the beach with you.
- I need you to keep a lookout.

101
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,298
When they get here, I'll call you.

102
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:05,050
If everything works out today...

103
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,678
...you and me, we're both gonna get
what we want.

104
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:09,388
Stay here.

105
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,935
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

106
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:59,104
I know you're just doing your job.

107
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,565
Bet you're as ready
for this to be over as I am.

108
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,569
Hey, once we get out of Panama...

109
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,989
...me, my dad and my uncle, we're
gonna open up a scuba shop.

110
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:10,782
- Build a house on a beach.
- Lovely.

111
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,242
Go swimming every day.

112
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:13,910
- I never lived by the ocean.
- Stop.

113
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:16,246
- I always wanted to, you know.
- I get it.

114
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:19,666
You're a human being with dreams,
plans for the future, all that.

115
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,918
Whether you see it
isn't up to me anymore.

116
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:26,047
It's in your uncle's hands now.
So let's just hope that he does his job.

117
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:51,865
- Write it down.
- Come on, man, come here.

118
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,622
What are you waiting for?

119
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,933
Where's Mahone?

120
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,601
He's gone.

121
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,354
Well, just like that?

122
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,730
Why? I mean, how?

123
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:09,484
How about we worry a little bit more
about ourselves?

124
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,695
No, he got out of here
kind of suddenly.

125
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:14,280
How do we know
he's not ratting us out right now?

126
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,538
Sullins. Yeah.

127
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:22,998
When did this happen?

128
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,332
Are you sure?

129
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,042
Yeah, I'll handle it.

130
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:28,962
Something wrong?

131
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,548
Couple of Panamanians
might have gotten cold feet.

132
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:36,094
- Exactly how cold?
- They just need some convincing.

133
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,805
It's nothing to worry about,
it's all gonna work out.

134
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:40,974
Meantime, we're gonna take you
to a hotel.

135
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,226
Up until an hour ago,
this was a done deal.

136
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:46,312
So, what's happening?

137
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,815
Relax, this is still your best bet.

138
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:52,819
Unless someone else is offering you
a get-out-of-Sona-free card.

139
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,202
Remember, we only have
four minutes of cover.

140
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,955
So once you hit the ground,
run straight to the fence.

141
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,833
Don't look up and don't look back,
and don't say a word.

142
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,171
- What if they see us?
- If somebody yells stop, you stop.

143
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,424
- That's it?
- That's it.

144
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:22,140
It's time. Where's Sammy?

145
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,527
So who goes first?

146
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,238
Now, my life isn't worth a damn
without yours.

147
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:41,618
If this doesn't go as planned, first guy
through that window is gonna get shot.

148
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:42,869
That guy can't be you.

149
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,375
I'll go. I got it.

150
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,753
Come on, come on, come on.

151
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,104
This is it.

152
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,401
Five.

153
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,362
Four.

154
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,447
Three.

155
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:21,032
Two.

156
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,700
One.

157
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:36,881
- The glare. Where's the glare?
- I don't know.

158
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,595
Come on, come on.

159
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,775
This is it.

160
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,491
Someone's coming.

161
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,252
- Good luck.
- You too.

162
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,714
We're losing the light.

163
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:45,051
Go back. Go back.

164
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,226
Go back.

165
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,004
Come on. Come on.

166
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,424
That was our only chance.

167
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,848
Damn it.

168
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,493
Find out where they are.

169
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:55,788
Do you hear them out there?
They're waiting for us.

170
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:58,124
- It's only a matter of time.
- I know. Come on.

171
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,834
The damn thing's not coming off.

172
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:02,670
Hey, gringos.

173
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:04,338
Come out and play.

174
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:05,923
Come on, come on.

175
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:08,301
Ain't nowhere to hide, malditos.

176
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:13,180
Gringos, come out and play.

177
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:15,182
We gotta go. They can't find us here.

178
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,018
- Well, what about this?
- Stash it.

179
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,061
Come on.

180
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,815
Come on.

181
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:26,819
Go, go.

182
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,447
Where you off to, bakra?

183
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:03,856
Where you boys been?

184
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,149
In the bathroom?

185
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:09,779
This has all been a terrible mistake.

186
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:11,030
Has it been?

187
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:12,698
We've worked it out.

188
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,451
There's no need
to take this any further.

189
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,456
No, you clearly don't understand.

190
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,750
I can't have your foolishness
in this place.

191
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,877
I gave you every chance to pull out.

192
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,837
Please.

193
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:30,758
We know the rules.

194
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:33,219
Two men go in, one man comes out.

195
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:41,560
Now, this quarrel must be settled.

196
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,773
Let's go.

197
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,173
Fight, fight, fight!

198
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:33,112
What are you gentlemen waiting for?

199
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,911
You don't make this
more interesting, I will.

200
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:49,628
Sorry, mate, but if only one of us
is getting out...

201
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:09,106
- How's it look?
- They got L.J. in the van.

202
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:11,692
- He seem all right to you?
- Yeah, I think so.

203
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:13,736
How many people they got?

204
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,655
- A driver and a bodyguard, that's it.
- All right.

205
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,574
I appreciate you hanging around.

206
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,035
Hey, we started this together, bro.

207
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:23,203
Let's finish it that way.

208
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:28,292
Come on, Michael. Where are you?

209
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:32,314
You're supposed to be keeping watch.

210
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:34,983
Just checking.
Making sure everything is all right.

211
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,945
We're running a bit late, that's all.

212
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:40,823
So, what's the plan?

213
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:44,076
You gonna swim out,
wait for the police to pass...

214
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:47,329
...and meet with a boat somewhere?

215
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,373
Something like that.

216
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,709
- And then what?
- You know what?

217
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,129
- You need to get back to the car--
- Don't move.

218
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:01,969
Wow. I'm impressed.

219
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,305
You got the guts to look me
in the eye as you stab me in the back.

220
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,391
- What you gonna do, shoot me?
- Don't.

221
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,893
I can't let you
hand over James to those people.

222
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,020
- Think about what you're doing.
- I have.

223
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:14,398
Ever since you told me
what they did to Sara.

224
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:17,401
When they get here,
James and I, we're leaving.

225
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:20,696
- Where to?
- I don't know.

226
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,281
Somewhere they won't find us.

227
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:26,285
- This whole time you played me.
- Like you've been playing me.

228
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,996
Bringing me here to be your lookout?

229
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,331
But it's okay.

230
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:34,585
We're both here doing what we have to
for the people we love.

231
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:40,215
You do this, you may as well
be shooting my son yourself.

232
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:48,181
I'm sorry.

233
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,407
- Yeah?
- They should be out by now. Any sign?

234
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:08,160
All quiet. How much longer
do you wanna give them?

235
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,166
I know you wanted to live
by an ocean.

236
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,044
The closest you'll get
is being buried under one.

237
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,837
- You're not gonna kill me.
- Oh?

238
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:20,839
You need me.
You already killed Sara.

239
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:24,468
Anything happens to me,
you're out of bargaining chips.

240
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:28,805
Michael doesn't get Whistler out today,
I don't need to bargain anymore.

241
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,891
You'll all be dead.

242
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,614
Kick him in the junk, Scofield.

243
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,958
What are you looking for?
There are no draws here.

244
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:41,837
If this isn't finished by one of you,
I'm coming down to finish both of you.

245
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,968
End it.

246
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,017
God. God, forgive me.

247
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:11,801
- They should've been here by now.
- They should be on their way.

248
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,471
- They didn't make it.
- So, what do we do now?

249
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,848
I don't care what you do,
I'm taking the car.

250
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,433
What?

251
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:17,242
What the hell's going on?

252
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:23,206
Put your hands over your head.

253
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,758
You, come down here.

254
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:36,177
Now.

255
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,389
We are going to find out
who is behind this.

256
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,733
- What?
- Gonna let me know what's going on?

257
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:54,404
- Lincoln?
- I'm here.

258
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:55,864
Good. Where are they?

259
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,244
- They're in the car with me.
- I heard the alarm.

260
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:03,454
They were long gone
before that went off.

261
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:06,457
If they got such a head start,
why are you so far behind?

262
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:08,459
Do you want me to talk to you
or drive?

263
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,879
I want you to put Whistler
on the phone.

264
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:12,213
What?

265
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,464
Put him on.

266
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:18,636
He's in the trunk,
but if you feel that strongly...

267
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:20,763
...I can pull over,
and you two can talk.

268
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,142
If we're lucky, cops will swing by,
because they'd like a word too.

269
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,229
You know what? Just get L.J. ready.

270
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:37,488
Whoever tried to escape
assaulted one of my men.

271
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:42,327
And as you know, any attempt
on the life of a Panamanian soldier...

272
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:45,872
...warrants the death penalty.

273
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,000
This attempt was made
from cell number 212.

274
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:54,964
And if memory serves, that cell belongs
to members of your crew, no?

275
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:11,981
You.

276
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:17,362
You are one of the milkman's boys.

277
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:21,074
Is it your cell?

278
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:43,680
I'm going to take that as a yes.

279
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:50,228
I thought we were compadres,
you and I.

280
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:52,980
I let you run your business,
have your whores.

281
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:55,483
When you asked me
for your own supply of water...

282
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,277
...when the plumbing went down,
did I not provide it?

283
00:29:58,444 --> 00:30:00,321
You asked me
to get rid of the phones...

284
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:03,783
...make them contraband,
so you could control the trade in here...

285
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,869
...did I not comply?

286
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:13,626
I do all of this for you, and in exchange,
you were to do one thing for me.

287
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,797
Keep these men in line!

288
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,016
Maybe we just backed
the wrong horse. Hmm?

289
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:34,564
Perhaps there is another in here
better suited for the job?

290
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:46,868
Good luck, bredda.

291
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:11,976
You know none of us tried
to break out of that cell.

292
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:14,228
I do.

293
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:18,274
Then you must know there's only
one guy here foolish enough to try.

294
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,831
Hey, nice to see you back in form.

295
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:37,043
Thanks. Any news from Sullins?

296
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:39,003
He's working on it.

297
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:44,759
It doesn't matter what people say.

298
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:47,261
What do they say?

299
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:50,223
You know people, how they talk.

300
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:54,602
- About?
- The men, the ones they say you killed.

301
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:56,854
Is it true?

302
00:31:57,772 --> 00:32:00,650
Because if it is,
you can talk to me about it.

303
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:11,702
Oh, God.

304
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:13,412
Is that a fact?

305
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:15,706
Yes, you can trust me.

306
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:19,001
So let me get this straight,
Sullins sends you to be good cop?

307
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,129
- That's not what this is.
- There never was a deal, was there?

308
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:23,631
Sullins wants me to confess.

309
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:27,009
- So he can bring me up on more charges.
- The deal is legit.

310
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:31,764
The hearing was supposed to be an hour
after we left, and I'm still waiting.

311
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,976
So why don't you just come clean,
Felicia? For old time's sake.

312
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:36,727
How about it?

313
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:40,815
How about you do me
the same courtesy, Alex?

314
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:44,527
I'm not blind, my brother was a user.
I can smell the stuff a mile away.

315
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,905
Don't you accuse me of being the one
who's hiding something.

316
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:57,832
The perimeter is secure. No one got out.

317
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:03,754
- Yeah?
- I just got confirmation from the radio.

318
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:06,465
Guards took a head count
and secured the perimeter.

319
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:08,676
No one made it out of there today.

320
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:12,847
Sucre, what's going on?

321
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:15,391
Looks like they're packing up.

322
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,518
Whatever you do,
don't let them take L.J.

323
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:20,521
- Just--
- Linc? Linc?

324
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,772
Sucre?

325
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:30,698
Get the hell out of here, now.

326
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:00,561
Look out!

327
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:56,742
- Dad!
- Let her go.

328
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:00,287
You touch him,
I'll put a bullet in her head.

329
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:03,457
- And you let him go, let him go now.
- Dad.

330
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,378
L.J., I'm gonna get you out of this,
I promise.

331
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:10,005
You sure you wanna make promises
you can't keep?

332
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,800
- Watch your mouth.
- I'll let you in on a little secret.

333
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,177
When you choose this line of work...

334
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:17,972
...it's all gonna come down
to a moment like this.

335
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:20,891
So kill me.

336
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:25,938
Let him go.

337
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:29,566
- Let him go.
- Kill him.

338
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:32,152
- Dad, Dad.
- Kill him.

339
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:35,948
It doesn't matter what you do to me.
The operation failed.

340
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,450
So put your gun down, Linc.

341
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:43,038
- Kill him.
- Dad!

342
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:49,753
No!

343
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:56,135
- Give me one more shot.
- To do what?

344
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:59,304
Let me find out what happened at Sona.
Let me talk to Michael.

345
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,224
We can still get Whistler.
We can make this happen.

346
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,685
We can make this happen, we can...

347
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,569
- We can do this.
- Put him in the van.

348
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:15,487
Dad.

349
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:40,179
Sucre.

350
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,973
- You all right?
- What happened?

351
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,605
Body bags.

352
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:06,497
- Look, what happened out there--
- Happened out there. It's over.

353
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:08,373
Right.

354
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:14,379
Right. But just so as you know,
I wouldn't have gone through with it.

355
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:16,673
Lucky for us
we'll never have to find out.

356
00:37:18,675 --> 00:37:20,135
So, what do we do now?

357
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:24,681
You know why we here, boy?

358
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:27,142
I'm no doctor, I'm guessing...

359
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:30,354
...your mother had a bit too much
to drink one night, and...

360
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,481
Keep talking
and you're gonna be next.

361
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:53,752
How you want it, brother?
Fast or slow?

362
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:58,131
I think I'd like
to handle this one myself.

363
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:12,896
Do you have children, Mr. Scofield?

364
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:16,024
Maybe someday.

365
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,819
That's very optimistic for a man
in your position.

366
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:20,445
Myself, I have five.

367
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:24,825
Three boys, two girls.
Now, I used to tell them a story.

368
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:28,412
I do believe in your country they call it
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

369
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,247
You know it?

370
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:33,834
Then you know the moral of that story
is when liars tell the truth...

371
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,460
...they can never be believed.

372
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,255
But your life's on the line, boy.

373
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:43,677
Are you trying to break out
of this prison, Mr. Scofield?

374
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:47,389
No.

375
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:53,061
- Are you trying to break out?
- We both know that's not possible.

376
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:54,479
- Answer me--
- What do you want?

377
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:56,606
Tell me the truth. I want to hear it.

378
00:38:56,815 --> 00:39:00,610
- You want a reason to kill me.
- No. I have good reason to kill you.

379
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:04,114
Because of you, it's no longer possible
for me to govern this prison.

380
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:06,992
Justified or not,
the men no longer have faith in me.

381
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,954
That leaves only one thing for me to do
to guarantee my survival.

382
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:27,637
You are breaking out of this prison,
Mr. Scofield.

383
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:30,307
And you're taking me with you.

384
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:59,753
Well, I got some good news
and I've got some better news.

385
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,213
Let's start with the good.

386
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:04,591
Panamanians are back on board.

387
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:06,593
And the better news?

388
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:10,305
You're gonna get to have
a really nice sleep on that bed.

389
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:13,183
I thought that after the hearing...

390
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,519
...I was gonna be on a plane
back to the U.S.

391
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:16,895
You said--

392
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,146
I did and you will be.

393
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:22,108
But it's just too late to do the hearing
now, we'll get to it tomorrow.

394
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:24,110
- Tomorrow morning?
- Sounds about right.

395
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:31,368
Please, is there something,
is there anything that we can do...

396
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:32,869
...to help speed things up?

397
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:36,623
When a genie grants you a wish,
you don't tell him to make it snappy.

398
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,417
This hearing needs to happen today.

399
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:43,004
This-- The hearing needs to happen
right now.

400
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:45,507
Listen to you.
You know, you are unbelievable.

401
00:40:45,715 --> 00:40:48,843
I have dropped everything
to come down here.

402
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,471
- Drag your ass out.
- You don't understand, I can't.

403
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,808
- I made you a deal.
- I can't wait.

404
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:57,852
I can't wait.

405
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:00,855
You know, I am so glad
I have made this trip...

406
00:41:01,064 --> 00:41:02,857
...to help your esteemed colleague.

407
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:04,859
I am just tickled.

408
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,445
Cuff him.

409
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:09,948
- Is that necessary?
- Cuff him.

410
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:19,249
I'm sorry.

411
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,127
I can't wait.

412
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:34,055
- Hey, have you seen Whistler?
- No.

413
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:39,394
You know, I spent my whole career
trying to keep bad people behind bars.

414
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:43,940
Like somehow, by doing my job,
I was making the world a better place.

415
00:41:45,025 --> 00:41:48,445
And then, then you hear about
what happened to someone like Sara.

416
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:54,576
Damn, it doesn't seem like there's
more bad people out there than in here.

417
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,168
I warned the brothers
what would happen if they failed.

418
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,836
If I give them more time now...

419
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:08,298
...I may as well hand them
a condom and a cigarette to go with it.

420
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,343
You know,
I came all the way down here.

421
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,928
The least you could do
is offer me an opinion.

422
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:17,223
I thought we agreed
it was best for you to not come here.

423
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,310
And I thought you needed
to be out in seven days.

424
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:23,646
I need to know how this delay
is gonna affect things.

425
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:27,442
Well, it won't be comfortable,
but it will be possible.

426
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:31,237
Well, thank you, James, but that doesn't
exactly ravage me with confidence.

427
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:34,032
- And what would?
- Your ass on a plane.

428
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,450
Four more days.

429
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:40,455
If I'm out of here by then,
I can still do it.

430
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,251
Trust me, it'll be fine.

431
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:48,254
I'll let the brothers know.

432
00:42:53,843 --> 00:42:55,595
Gretchen.

433
00:42:56,137 --> 00:42:57,597
About Sofia...

434
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:02,769
She's fine.
Burrows is taking real good care of her.

435
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:05,688
Good luck, James.
