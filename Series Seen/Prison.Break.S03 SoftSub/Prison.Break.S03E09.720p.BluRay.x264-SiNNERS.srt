1
00:00:02,118 --> 00:00:04,037
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:08,708
Sona's a one-way street.
What goes in never comes out.

3
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:10,376
They got me and Sara.

4
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:13,922
L.J. and Sara will be traded
for Whistler. Are we clear?

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,674
I'll tell you the plan
when you tell me who you are.

6
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:18,343
- I'm a fisherman.
- Really?

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,094
My life is in your hands.

8
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:22,055
How's L.J.? How's Sara?

9
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:24,599
She's dead, Michael. I lied to you.

10
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:30,688
You are breaking out of this prison,
Mr. Scofield.

11
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:32,231
You're taking me with you.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,694
Four more days. If I'm out of here
by then, I can still do it.

13
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,781
There have been two escape
attempts in the past two days.

14
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,075
Say goodbye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.

15
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,320
My predecessor, Colonel Escamilla,
wasn't an effective leader.

16
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:20,571
He's been replaced.

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,449
I am General Zavala. Sit.

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,244
A drink of water?

19
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:33,000
With due respect, general, I had nothing
to do with what happened here today.

20
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,753
I always conduct
a thorough investigation...

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,798
...and there are too many
unanswered questions here.

22
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,467
It is my job to find those answers.

23
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,636
If you help me do my job, I'll help you.

24
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:45,847
The helicopters.

25
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:50,351
You couldn't be responsible for that. You
weren't flying a helicopter, were you?

26
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:51,644
- No.
- Who was?

27
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,938
- I don't know. No.
- You know who sent them?

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,277
Again, be advised:
Telling the truth is in your best interest.

29
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,028
I am.

30
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:07,952
Let's go for a walk.

31
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,787
I understand your fears.

32
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:13,124
But the Republic of Panama
cannot allow this sort of activity.

33
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,918
If you wish to talk, now's the time.

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,506
I would,
if there is anything left to say.

35
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,884
Then you give me no choice.
This way.

36
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,931
This isn't good.
They're putting him in the hot box.

37
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,351
Things are gonna get much harder
for you.

38
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:37,106
There's no way to win.
You must cooperate.

39
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:40,359
Confess to this escape
and face your punishment by law...

40
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:43,487
...or face a far greater punishment
in the Panama sun.

41
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,656
It's up to you.

42
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,163
It's done. It's finished.

43
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,685
I hope my brother's all right.

44
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,604
- Does it hurt?
- It's fine.

45
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,439
I need to get to the prison.

46
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,733
I was watching the news
in the waiting room.

47
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,653
They identified a few bodies,
but it wasn't them.

48
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,072
I'll find out when I get there.
You wanna come?

49
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,993
I don't know. After everything that's
happened, I don't know what to think.

50
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,577
What is there to think about?

51
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:16,497
James has an answer for everything.
Nothing makes sense.

52
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:19,041
Stop asking questions
and just look at the facts.

53
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,377
I wanted to believe everything
he was saying.

54
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:25,214
- And I still want him to get out.
- I want him out as well.

55
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,676
Trust me, I've been working on this
every single day.

56
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:32,012
Lincoln, I really appreciate
everything you have done.

57
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,975
You saved my life.
You didn't have to help me like that.

58
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,810
Yeah, I did.

59
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:46,402
- Get in the car.
- Come on.

60
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,373
Everywhere I go, there you are.

61
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,460
Go home, Sofia.

62
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,227
Part of me wanted
to drive right past this gate, Alex.

63
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,688
You don't deserve to be here.

64
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:29,361
Actually, if you take all things
into consideration, I do.

65
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,827
- Thank you.
- Wait.

66
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,166
Don't.

67
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,753
My father worked in the mine
for 30 years.

68
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,547
He took this into work with him
every day.

69
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,592
Kept him safe till the day he retired.

70
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:53,844
Then he gave it to me.

71
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,016
I can't take this.

72
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,352
Give it back when you get out.

73
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,942
- Take care of yourself, Alex.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:47,106
You ain't got the guts
to do it yourself?

75
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:50,985
Hey, this is for you, so shut up
before I change my mind.

76
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,654
After yesterday,
you may be doubting my ability...

77
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:55,447
...to make good on our agreement.

78
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,324
I need to keep you motivated.

79
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,784
You have one minute.

80
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,797
L.J., oh, God. Thank God you're alive.

81
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,807
Forget it. There's nothing you can do.

82
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,684
- There's always something.
- Dad.

83
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:25,060
These guys are thorough.

84
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,938
They follow you everywhere.
Trust me.

85
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,109
That bitch is crazy.

86
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,738
She cut Sara's head off. I was there.

87
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,490
I closed my eyes, but I heard it.

88
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:41,994
You listen to me. I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, all right?

89
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:45,038
The next time you see me,
don't take your eyes off me.

90
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:47,332
I'll tell you what to do, all right?

91
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,251
Minute's up.

92
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,129
Me and your uncle,
we know what we're doing.

93
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:55,257
We're gonna get you out of this, okay?

94
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,968
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you too.

95
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:29,208
Looks like things didn't go so well.
You should be gone.

96
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,584
So should you.

97
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,377
What happened?

98
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,964
It's still happening.

99
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:38,842
I feel bad for Michael,
but we have a way without him.

100
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,179
- You should get some rest.
- What's the way?

101
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,723
I'll rest, I'll rest. I'll rest when I'm out.

102
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:47,851
I won't go without you.
You have my word.

103
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:49,561
Now get some rest.

104
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,615
You see Scofield
out in that redneck sauna?

105
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:04,201
Let's see if he has the tattoo
to get out of that.

106
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,078
You were in on it, right?

107
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:10,249
I see you guys lurking around Lechero's.
Scofield's gotta have a plan to escape.

108
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,708
If so, I know none of it.

109
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,586
Yeah, I bet you don't.

110
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,465
Whoa. Too many cocktails
out on the Lido deck.

111
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,387
Here comes trouble.

112
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,347
Señor Criada.

113
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,933
- Clean it up.
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.

114
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,436
Did you not hear what I said?
I told you to do something, now do it.

115
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:34,231
Cleaning up chunks
ain't in my job description anymore.

116
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:36,733
Things change.
You have to answer to us now.

117
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:40,529
Hey, caveman, you don't scare me.
Go bug someone else.

118
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,450
Oh.

119
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:21,194
Jorge.

120
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:28,118
I have a special delivery.
I need it to get in real quick.

121
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,662
- How much?
- I gave you 10 grand.

122
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,622
Ten grand's for the last one.
How much for this one?

123
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,126
- No grand.
- Then, no, thanks.

124
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,919
No, no, no.

125
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:53,351
- Take this water to the prisoner.
- Why should I? He doesn't deserve it.

126
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:57,564
I'll do it.

127
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:14,956
Hi, brother. Remember me?

128
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,083
This isn't gonna work.

129
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,543
Come on, papi, drink this.

130
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,171
You can't let anything
happen to L.J., okay?

131
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:25,550
It's okay. He's doing much better
than you. Come on.

132
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:26,885
Drink this. You need it.

133
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:38,855
I'm sorry about Sara.

134
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,694
I'm gonna try to sneak more
into the prison next time, okay?

135
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,531
- I want you to quit.
- I can't.

136
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,492
- We all have to quit sometime.
- Well, I'm not gonna.

137
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,787
You're in a chicken coop.
You need all the help you can get.

138
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:57,749
- I don't. Just go, don't come back.
- Not after everything you've done for me.

139
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,544
Go.

140
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,142
I see you tried
to catch a flight out yesterday.

141
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:19,312
- I did what I had to do.
- But you went back on our deal.

142
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,607
I was saving my ass. I'm sure
you're familiar with the strategy.

143
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,651
Now, you watch it. I'm still boss here.

144
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:26,236
Who cares about who's boss?

145
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:29,614
Do you wanna get out of here
or do you wanna keep talking about it?

146
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,120
It's okay. We just need to brace it.

147
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,747
No. We need the engineer.

148
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,541
Move it.

149
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,043
Get out of here
before Sammy gets back.

150
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:01,521
Ninety-eight degrees in the shade,
125 in the box.

151
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,983
Let's go inside. We'll have a chat
in the air conditioning.

152
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,862
Tomorrow's gonna be hotter,
and the next day even hotter.

153
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,156
The day after that, you'll be dead.

154
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,824
You don't understand.

155
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,702
If I thought you could help me...

156
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,163
I can.

157
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,416
You're unaware of the influence
I have in this province.

158
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,128
You'd rather I be your ally
than your enemy, wouldn't you?

159
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,088
You don't know these people.

160
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,840
We can't stop them.

161
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:32,052
Not you. Not me.

162
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,805
There was a man.

163
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:39,059
A drug kingpin.
The most powerful man in Panama.

164
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:44,105
A ruthless killer with an army of thugs
and thieves behind him.

165
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:47,400
He killed judges, policemen,
anyone who stood in his way.

166
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,235
They said he couldn't be stopped.

167
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:52,989
But now, Lechero is in prison
and I'm in power.

168
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:56,868
I decide whose life is at stake,
and right now, it's yours.

169
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,706
From the moment I got here...

170
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,628
...I've been planning my escape.

171
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:14,969
He's talking.

172
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:16,846
How do you know?

173
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,099
You can't get out of the box
any other way.

174
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,368
The people who sent the helicopters...

175
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,332
...they're the same people who
framed my brother back in the U.S.

176
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,212
The same people
who wanted me here in Sona.

177
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,549
In order for you
to break out another inmate?

178
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:56,553
- Yes.
- Who are these people?

179
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,681
I don't know.

180
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:02,559
But they have my brother's son.

181
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,353
They like to keep collateral.

182
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:09,607
I could be putting his life in danger
as we speak.

183
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,026
If what you told me is true...

184
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,155
...you would be saving him.

185
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:20,201
I would call my troops and order
a search for the boy immediately.

186
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,204
But this story?

187
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,873
- It's fiction.
- It's true.

188
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,004
It's what you wanted.
It's the only thing I have left to give.

189
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,257
Please.

190
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:37,802
His name is L.J.

191
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:41,222
He's only 16 years old.

192
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,232
- What's that smell?
- They're Armandos.

193
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:54,944
- These things cost money.
- Somebody gave them to me.

194
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,362
- I don't smoke.
- Who?

195
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,324
This guy. I ran some stuff
into the prison for him.

196
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,994
- You ran stuff into the prison? Drugs?
- Who cares? He paid me.

197
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,621
- You should've quit that job--
- I know, I know.

198
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:08,708
I need some cash for my kid.
Maricruz doesn't have insurance.

199
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,419
Listen, I just saw Michael.

200
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:14,380
- He's in solitary confinement.
- What?

201
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,425
They put him in a box out in the yard
all by himself.

202
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,218
He can't do anything.

203
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,347
It's gonna be okay.

204
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,600
It's not gonna be okay.
I don't know what to do, man.

205
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:30,271
Everything's just falling apart.

206
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,569
What you looking at?

207
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,029
The view.

208
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:41,449
I can't help but notice
you and Lechero made friends.

209
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:44,202
He's been hanging out
with a lot of white boys lately.

210
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,579
- Got a problem with that?
- No, but Sammy does.

211
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:49,123
See, I've been looking close,
like I always do...

212
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,667
...and I know
you all would be a lot better off...

213
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,961
...if Sammy were no longer around.

214
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:57,423
Wouldn't have to worry about his snout
poking in your business.

215
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:01,511
- You're suggesting?
- You and I know it needs to happen.

216
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,805
Aren't many men
that would take on Sammy.

217
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:07,308
I have one particular man in mind.
A man who owes me.

218
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:11,354
But if I pull through, I'm in the club,
guaranteed. You're gonna see to it.

219
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:13,940
Heh-heh. All right.

220
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,734
I assume you have the power
to make this deal?

221
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,987
I do. Agreed.

222
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:29,038
Right. Well, thank you, sir.

223
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:00,486
Look, I've been thinking
about what you told me.

224
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,155
- But I can't quit my job.
- Do whatever you wanna do.

225
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,241
I would if you kick me a few bucks.

226
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,660
Again?
I told you, I don't have any cash.

227
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,162
- What do you expect me to do?
- Do what you want.

228
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:13,165
- You could use my help.
- Charging me for your friendship?

229
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:17,128
- I got a kid on the way.
- I got a kid I may never see again.

230
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:27,722
Yeah, get me Gretchen.

231
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:37,982
Much to my surprise, there seems to
be some degree of truth to your tale.

232
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,027
- Everything I told you is true.
- That's for me to determine.

233
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,237
- What more can I say?
- This inmate...

234
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:46,198
...the one you've been sent to free...

235
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,701
...he should be able to verify
what you told me.

236
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:51,495
He should, but I don't know if he will.

237
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:53,414
Tell me his name.

238
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,878
They won't hesitate to kill my nephew.
I need to know you can find him.

239
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,297
- I will, but I need a name.
- I need your word.

240
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:05,051
You have it, I'll find the boy.
Now, the name.

241
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:11,641
Hi.

242
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,478
What's wrong?

243
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:17,355
Why don't you tell me?

244
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,399
I went to that apartment,
your apartment.

245
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:23,069
And this woman showed up,
like she knew you.

246
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:25,821
And then I found a passport.

247
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:28,741
Who's Gary Miller?

248
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,039
That apartment, that passport...

249
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,166
...it's all for us.

250
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,252
It's how we're gonna get away.

251
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,215
I've been working on a way
for us to be together.

252
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:46,467
Remember how we always talked
about France?

253
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:49,387
Oh, James. Yeah. Heh.

254
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:52,056
Our plan to be together.

255
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:57,895
James, how can I believe you?
How can I believe anything anymore?

256
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,899
Whistler. Come.

257
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:05,528
Just know-- Just know that I love you.

258
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,376
You are facing some serious charges.

259
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:26,048
Michael Scofield told me
there are some people out there...

260
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:29,260
...who are very determined
to get you out of here.

261
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,221
What's he talking about?

262
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,890
- You know nothing about this?
- No.

263
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,394
Scofield's a smart man, but...

264
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,312
...he's got a rabid imagination.

265
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,523
So you're calling him a liar?

266
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:45,985
More or less.

267
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:51,240
I've been able to verify the story.

268
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:55,828
I already know everything,
Mr. Whistler, in detail.

269
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:57,371
I just need a name.

270
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,999
Who's in charge on the outside?

271
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,085
We can end this right now
if you can provide it.

272
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,757
What are you talking about?

273
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,698
What's going on here?

274
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:45,002
Now, start over.

275
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,837
- Hey.
- There you are.

276
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:51,842
And here I am
without my bag of goodies.

277
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,096
I was afraid you was gone for good.

278
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:59,350
The party would not be the same
without you.

279
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm glad you're back,
because I need a favor.

280
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:08,609
It involves you, a chicken foot
and a man who's got it coming.

281
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:12,237
- What man?
- Sammy.

282
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:15,783
When you get well, you get him out in
that ring and you do that one...

283
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:17,034
...neck thing.

284
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:20,829
In exchange, I'm gonna cover
all your medical expenses.

285
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,542
I tell you what, you take your time.

286
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,962
I'm gonna go get my bag right now
and get you out of this misery.

287
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,340
You're the best cock in the fight, Alex.

288
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:33,050
Please don't let me down.

289
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,973
Maybe now you'll feel more
comfortable telling me the truth.

290
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:44,395
Are you working with Scofield?

291
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,945
- Are you working with Scofield?
- Yes, yes, I'm working with Scofield.

292
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:55,823
But there's no one else involved.

293
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:08,043
As they say in America,
we're gonna get the story straight.

294
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,754
I told them the truth.

295
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,631
I suggest you do the same.

296
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:14,883
- I have.
- He's confirmed nothing.

297
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,386
Ask him about that woman
he's been meeting with.

298
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,388
Huh?

299
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:22,099
It's not what you think.

300
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,768
It matters what you know,
and you know her name.

301
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:28,939
The fact that he won't admit it tells me
that he's no innocent bystander in this.

302
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:30,899
- You know I am.
- Prove it.

303
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:34,403
- That's the only way we're getting out.
- Michael, this is suicide.

304
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,239
They'll kill Sofia
and they'll kill your brother's son.

305
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:41,702
This is the man who can help. He can't
do anything without a name, so tell him!

306
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,457
James, we don't have a choice.

307
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,835
It's over.

308
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:54,590
Gretchen Morgan.

309
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:08,270
I don't know where she lives.
I don't know how you find her.

310
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:11,607
That's all I know, her name.

311
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:14,568
Gretchen Morgan.

312
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:28,582
- Two more of those, please.
- Mm-mm. Uh-uh.

313
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:30,751
- I'm gonna get going.
- No, he'll stay.

314
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,462
Relax. Fernando, is it?

315
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,799
Just wanna talk a minute. Alone.

316
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:42,804
This right here...
is as alone as we're gonna get.

317
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:45,891
I heard about your argument
with Lincoln.

318
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:49,478
You people are everywhere, huh?

319
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,313
Now, you know him better than I do.

320
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,067
But from personal experience,
Burrows can be hard to handle.

321
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:58,153
That man does not like
to be told what to do.

322
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:00,405
He sure likes
bossing everyone else around.

323
00:25:00,614 --> 00:25:03,325
You have to start looking out
for yourself, Fernando.

324
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,535
Level the playing field.

325
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:08,121
All you have to do is go back,
apologize.

326
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:10,916
Tell him that you'll stay on
a few more days for free.

327
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,919
Tomorrow or the day after,
I'll call, meet me for a drink.

328
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,338
In exchange, I'll pay.

329
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:17,798
Fifty grand.

330
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:19,508
I know what you're thinking.

331
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:22,344
I'm not asking you to do anything
that doesn't help everyone.

332
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:23,762
I don't see this helping.

333
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,765
Lincoln causes as many problems
as he solves.

334
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:30,227
He needs to get out of his own way
and I think you can assist him.

335
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,896
I stay one step ahead
and you get 50 grand.

336
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:38,902
I don't know.

337
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,031
I think you do.

338
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:58,088
Where do I find this Gretchen Morgan?

339
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:00,674
She's somewhere in Panama City.

340
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:03,301
That's not much help
in a city of a million people.

341
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:06,596
- It would take days, weeks.
- I've told you, I only know her name.

342
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:10,392
- I have no idea.
- I do.

343
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,894
But I'll need to use a phone.

344
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,695
- Linc?
- Michael.

345
00:26:21,903 --> 00:26:23,029
What phone are you on?

346
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:24,656
Just listen to me.

347
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:28,994
I need to know where and when
your next meeting with Susan B. is.

348
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:32,539
Garfield Price building downtown,
in an hour. Why?

349
00:26:32,747 --> 00:26:36,084
Garfield Price. One hour.

350
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,962
- You can give her a message for me?
- Yeah.

351
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:41,214
Tell her everything's going as planned.

352
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:43,467
What's going on?
Why are you in solitary--?

353
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,761
Just give her the message, Linc.
I'll see you soon.

354
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:27,802
You should've listened.

355
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:31,097
Are you gonna throw down
a chicken foot over a puddle of puke?

356
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,683
You should've mopped.

357
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:44,402
Stumpy, wait your turn, man.

358
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:53,995
Excuse me. I wanted to see
Patron Lechero, por favor.

359
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:57,540
What you wanna see him about?

360
00:27:57,749 --> 00:28:00,251
I got one of these from him,
and I didn't do nothing.

361
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:02,003
He don't listen.

362
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:12,097
The fight goes on as planned
after we eat lunch.

363
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:26,611
Sammy.

364
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,322
You issue a fight?

365
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,282
Yeah, what about it?

366
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:35,704
It's not your right. It's not your place.

367
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:37,831
Well, maybe it should be.

368
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:55,890
She's arrived. I'm on my way.

369
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,518
You better be right.

370
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:09,738
What happened?

371
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,285
- It worked.
- It did?

372
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:17,579
Yeah, she came up to me,
just like you said.

373
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:19,706
Offered me cash
to talk behind your back.

374
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:22,917
- So we stick to the plan, right? Cool.
- Yeah.

375
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:25,587
I'm gonna go and see her right now.

376
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:37,599
It's okay. I came back for you.

377
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:40,810
Come on, now.
Everything's gonna be okay.

378
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,771
You can't deprive yourself like this.

379
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:45,815
Get-- Get out of here.

380
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:47,525
You don't mean that.

381
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:50,778
- Yeah, yeah. I do, I do.
- You're not talking straight.

382
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:54,115
You're not talking straight.
Withdrawals are the worst way to die.

383
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:57,285
You're gonna shake and sweat
until you evaporate into nothing.

384
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:59,913
A long road into hell.
Is that what you want, Alex?

385
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,915
Or do you wanna live?

386
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:07,003
I'll see you on the other side.

387
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:18,431
When you're up all night...

388
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,310
...and diarrhea is running down both
your legs and vomit is in your hair...

389
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:26,814
...don't come crawling back.

390
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,340
It's been a long day.
Let's just get this over with.

391
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,885
I got a message from my brother.
Everything's going ahead as planned.

392
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:58,972
Really? Well, I'd think
he'd be facing a major setback.

393
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,891
You know Michael,
always has things worked out.

394
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,519
I don't. Seems to me
he keeps screwing things up.

395
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:06,854
He's getting things done
faster than you.

396
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:09,065
Now, Whistler's out by tomorrow,
right?

397
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:12,485
- Gretchen Morgan?
- Yes.

398
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:14,946
General Zavala,
Panamanian National Police.

399
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:17,657
- Come with us, please.
- Why? What's this all about?

400
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:19,784
No, I don't understand. Wait.

401
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:24,122
I had nothing to do with this.
I had nothing to do with this. Nothing.

402
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:40,513
You're denying that you were involved
in the escape attempts at Sona Prison?

403
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,807
I have never been here before
in my life.

404
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:46,019
- You've never met any of the men here?
- No.

405
00:31:46,227 --> 00:31:47,311
James Whistler?

406
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,397
- No.
- You know what I've been told?

407
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,607
From prisoners? I can only imagine.

408
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:54,944
I've been told that you're
the mastermind behind a prison escape.

409
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:57,530
And that you've kidnapped
a boy as collateral.

410
00:31:57,697 --> 00:32:01,034
Really? Am I an alien?

411
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:02,702
Did I shoot JFK?

412
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,956
Sir, I have no idea
who this James Wilson--

413
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:09,792
- Whistler.
- ...is.

414
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,377
I am just here to relax...

415
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:13,713
...before I have to go back
to another year...

416
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,841
...of teaching social studies
to freshman idiots.

417
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:18,509
You're a tourist here?

418
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:22,930
No, not a tourist, sir.

419
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:26,517
I like to think of myself
as a student of life.

420
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:29,520
A student of life?

421
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:37,695
What did he say?

422
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:39,781
"Turn on the hose."

423
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:24,825
Fight, fight, fight.

424
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,047
I'm gonna give you one chance.

425
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:41,926
Did you order the escape
from Sona Penitentiary?

426
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:44,595
Yes or no?

427
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:07,410
Yes or no?

428
00:34:11,664 --> 00:34:13,708
You seem concerned for her.

429
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:18,671
She holds our entire future
in her hands. Yeah, I'm concerned.

430
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:28,472
Yes or no?

431
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:39,066
No.

432
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,695
You proved one thing.
This is not your first time.

433
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:56,125
Come with me.

434
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,390
Do you know either of these men?

435
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:14,977
- I've never seen them before.
- That's a lie.

436
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:18,773
- Never seen them before in my life.
- Where and when have you seen her?

437
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:22,234
She came to see him in visitation.
Isn't that right?

438
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:25,321
Is this the woman you work for?

439
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:28,741
Did she order the prison escape?

440
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:33,579
Yes or no?

441
00:35:37,374 --> 00:35:39,001
Yes.

442
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,796
All right. All right.

443
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:45,049
- You're the one in charge?
- No.

444
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:48,135
I don't know anything
about a prison escape.

445
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:51,472
I'm just the babysitter.
I watch the kid.

446
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,390
Where is he?

447
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:56,727
Near Paloma. Highway 2.

448
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:58,604
I can take you.

449
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:02,191
Take them back to my office.
Put the girl back in the car.

450
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,818
We're going on a drive.

451
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:09,657
Was it you?

452
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:11,450
Did you kill Sara?

453
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:15,037
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

454
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,417
I'm coming for you.

455
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,969
Yeah!

456
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:13,721
Yeah!

457
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:24,940
Congratulations.

458
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:27,234
You's a regular Buster Douglas,
aren't you?

459
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,485
Hey, what is this?

460
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:31,780
How'd you get that up there, huh?

461
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:40,748
Mm-hm.

462
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,965
Right there. The boy's in there.

463
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:55,429
- In here?
- I'm sorry.

464
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,017
I'm so sorry.

465
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,230
I hope he's all right.

466
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:34,927
Pick me up. I'm at the shack.

467
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,262
Bring towels.

468
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,895
Hi, Lincoln.

469
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:56,532
Augusto.

470
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,116
Good to see you.

471
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:00,077
Yeah, thanks for the cigars.

472
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:02,329
You didn't open the package?

473
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:04,331
I'll get around to it today.

474
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:09,503
You need to make a choice.

475
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:11,672
Lechero's days are numbered.

476
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,715
You agree?

477
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:16,885
Then you know what you need to do.

478
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,346
You've done a good job so far.

479
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:22,307
Now is the time to make a move.

480
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:25,060
Prove yourself.

481
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:28,438
Go back in and open the package.

482
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,348
Come on. Let's go.

483
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:04,933
What happened to the general?

484
00:40:05,142 --> 00:40:09,187
The general was found dead
this morning off Highway 2.

485
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:11,815
You're going back inside.

486
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,028
I'm sorry to hear that.

487
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:18,238
He seemed like a nice man.

488
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:49,478
What are you doing back here?

489
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:52,314
If you still wanna get out of here,
I need your phone.

490
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:58,236
Go inside.

491
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,914
- What?
- How's L.J.?

492
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:11,500
He's fine, but you know what?
Susan's not.

493
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,251
He's fine? You're sure?

494
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,670
Yeah, I just got off the phone
with him.

495
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:17,839
Why didn't you tell me
what's going on?

496
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:20,300
He could've died
because of what you did.

497
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:24,221
We've still got Whistler.
As long as we do, we're good.

498
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:27,390
I gotta go.

499
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:30,685
Hey, did you see blanco?

500
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:34,689
He's walking around like the landlord.
You said Lechero would take care of it.

501
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:37,025
- He will.
- How long has he been saying that?

502
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:41,321
If you and Lechero wanna go around like
an old couple fighting this way or that...

503
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:44,533
- ...maybe you'd like it in the kitchen.
- You be careful--

504
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:46,118
Then do something.

505
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:50,288
Or the next thing you know you're
gonna be taking orders from Scofield.

506
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,336
Some people will stop at nothing, huh?

507
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:58,296
Uh--

508
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:03,760
Yeah, I know.
At least we're back inside.

509
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:08,723
Which, of course, is exactly
what you wanted, isn't it?

510
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,269
- What are you talking about?
- You let the fox into the henhouse.

511
00:42:12,435 --> 00:42:14,271
Only reason you gave up
Gretchen's name...

512
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,940
...was so she could pull you out
of the fire.

513
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:18,817
You wanted me to give up her name.

514
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:24,906
- You know it doesn't end with her?
- Yeah, I do.

515
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:26,950
The question is, how do you?

516
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:31,079
How does a simple fisherman seem
to know so much about the Company?

517
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:34,875
When she comes back, and she will...

518
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:39,754
...what am I gonna say?

519
00:42:40,922 --> 00:42:42,883
Are you gonna do this or not?

520
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:47,512
You can tell her the answer is yes.

521
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:51,391
But once we're out,
I consider you collateral.

522
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:53,101
Nothing more.
