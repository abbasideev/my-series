1
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:03,928
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,596
We leave tonight.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,890
It's got no electricity
and no running water.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,935
- A hundred bucks a month.
- Deal.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,311
You ready?

6
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,482
I hope this works, papi.

7
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,736
That book of yours,
it's just a bunch of coordinates, right?

8
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:21,070
Among other things.

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,781
Does your father still have
that number I gave you?

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,576
- I think so.
- Well, tell him to call my brother.

11
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:30,496
- Papa, make that call for my friend.
- The American?

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:34,167
If time runs out and I don't have
the second half of those coordinates...

13
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,919
...L.J. and the señorita stop breathing.

14
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,678
I just wish there was another way
to do this...

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,765
...to save L.J.
without handing Whistler over.

16
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:51,142
Look, man, that's it, there isn't.

17
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,312
- What is that?
- Kesslivol.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,648
When heated to a certain degree,
it eats through steel.

19
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,569
- As soon as Linc cuts the power, we go.
- What about the backup generator?

20
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:04,739
There's a lag when power cuts
to when the generator kicks in.

21
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:08,618
- How long a lag we talking about here?
- Thirty seconds.

22
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:25,259
We only have 30 seconds. Go!

23
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:43,903
Move it, move it.

24
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,283
Shh, shh...

25
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,577
Come on.

26
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,165
All right, let's go.

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,126
- Okay, let's go.
- Not yet.

28
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,504
We have to go now.
We're running out of time.

29
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,214
Trust me.

30
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,236
Come on, mate.
Is there a holdup, Michael?

31
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,154
Just a little bit longer.

32
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,808
- What happened?
- They got caught.

33
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,477
Bring them over here.
Bring them over here.

34
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:08,279
- What's going on?
- Shut up.

35
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,909
- What--? What--?
- Don't try anything.

36
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:21,208
Bring them over here.
Bring them over here.

37
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,461
Get on your knees. Get down!

38
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,881
Don't move,
or you're like your friend over here.

39
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,220
What's going on, Michael?

40
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,481
This sure as hell better work out.

41
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:48,486
For everyone's sake.

42
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:14,261
You two, on your feet.

43
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,767
- Where the hell is Scofield?
- Shut it.

44
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:23,354
If he doesn't get caught,
he could still fix this mess.

45
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,790
What do we do now?
The lights are on--

46
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,417
- What's your plan, Michael?
- This is the plan.

47
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,546
Michael,
how is getting caught your plan?

48
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:34,633
You told them 30 seconds. You knew
the generator was gonna kick in sooner.

49
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,803
- I must have miscalculated.
- We've got 10 minutes till sunrise.

50
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,388
There are soldiers out there.

51
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:43,017
- They'll take count, we gotta get back.
- We're not going anywhere.

52
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,685
It's almost time.

53
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,629
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing. It's probably my wife.

54
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:15,674
We live a couple miles away,
she must have heard the siren.

55
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:20,304
You can make your calls when I'm done
with you. What else you got?

56
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:22,931
- Sucre?
- I'm not here, say what you gotta say.

57
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,726
Sucre, where are you?
We're counting on you to be here.

58
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:29,605
If you're not there, we're dead, man.
Now, call me back, please.

59
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,448
Put these with his personal effects.

60
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,744
- What's going on?
- Some prisoners tried to escape.

61
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:45,037
Did they get out?

62
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,955
They got caught.

63
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:49,833
And one of them got shot pretty badly.

64
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,846
- Sucre, Sucre?
- No, it is Alfonso Gallego.

65
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,599
- You where you need to be?
- Yes.

66
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:10,229
I left the Suburban on the road. The keys
are in the wheel well. Check them out.

67
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:23,283
- Ah. They're here.
- All right, good, good.

68
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,994
You will be here too, on the 312?

69
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:29,164
Yeah, yeah, the 312. See you there.

70
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,805
These all the men?

71
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:51,436
Tell me. How did you get there?

72
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,147
How did you get out there?

73
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,485
You don't wanna tell me.

74
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,992
How did you get out there?

75
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,289
A tunnel.

76
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,999
Where?

77
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,918
Under Lechero's room.

78
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,050
Show me.

79
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:38,358
- How much longer?
- It's just a matter of seconds now.

80
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,664
Michael.

81
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,547
- A door.
- I don't know the combination.

82
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:03,133
- Then improvise.
- This is insane.

83
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,767
Let's go.

84
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:08,824
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

85
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:28,760
Hurry.

86
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,456
That son of a bitch sold us out.

87
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:17,017
It wasn't me, it was Scofield.
He did this. Just check the yard.

88
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,936
Him, Whistler and Mahone
and that basketball kid...

89
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:21,980
...none of them will be there.

90
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,675
This is
Captain Soijo. Other inmates are missing.

91
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:54,888
I want a post and protect around
the entire perimeter of the precinct.

92
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,016
General, we see no one.

93
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:42,811
Are you sure there's prisoners
out here?

94
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:48,400
You won't find the prisoners here
in no man's land...

95
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,652
...because they're already gone.

96
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,831
This way.

97
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,920
Get off the bus, now.

98
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,589
Get off the bus!

99
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,632
He was about this tall, um...

100
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,397
Come on, move it. Go.

101
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:34,839
- What's wrong?
- My ankle, I've torn it apart.

102
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:37,008
Come on, it's not that far.
Help me out.

103
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,761
I'll drag you by your hair
because we gotta go.

104
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,641
- I'll slow you down. Go, leave me.
- We both know that's not an option.

105
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:46,643
It's a quarter of a mile to the beach.

106
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:49,604
We stick to the bush, we can make it.
Alex, a little help.

107
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:52,357
Go, go. Come on.

108
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,333
Hey!

109
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,128
Hey, we only have a few minutes.

110
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,464
- We got soldiers behind us.
- Cops as well.

111
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,383
- We got what we need?
- Yeah.

112
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:20,259
What do we need?

113
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,555
Always picking up the strays, huh?
This way.

114
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,808
Come on. Come on, let's go.

115
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:52,750
If you think the Company's gonna let you
swap me for your nephew...

116
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,585
- ...you're mistaken.
- Shut up.

117
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:59,590
They get me, they'll kill all of you.
I don't want Sofia caught in crossfire.

118
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:05,680
Listen, just let me go.
I'll contact them, I promise.

119
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,224
I'll turn myself in
once I know L.J.'s safe.

120
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,769
You got no say in what happens
to my son, you got it?

121
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:16,524
We don't need a suntan,
we need to get lost.

122
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:33,791
- Military patrols roads around the prison.
- Didn't consider a boat?

123
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,128
They show up, we're 10 yards off
the shore, we're target practice.

124
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:40,173
- We need to be invisible.
- Five guys, four tanks.

125
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,425
Sucks for you, Mahone.

126
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,052
Linc and I will share.

127
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,473
Toss your boots in the box.

128
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:53,769
Yeah?

129
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:57,023
- Tell me you have him.
- Yeah, I got him.

130
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:00,359
- Where's my son?
- With me.

131
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:02,320
Put him on the phone, now.

132
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:05,198
- Say something.
- I'll be there soon.

133
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,867
- Just don't hurt anyone.
- You happy?

134
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:11,787
You have 20 minutes to meet me
in Panama City where we agreed.

135
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,748
We'll be there.

136
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,546
Hey, I need to put my book in that.

137
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:25,426
My book. My book.

138
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,307
It fell out of my pocket.

139
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:34,727
- I thought you figured the coordinates.
- I wrote them in the book.

140
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:38,272
- I'm sure they're still looking for us.
- It's gone. Get in the water.

141
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,024
Would you, please?

142
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,319
It's a picture of my son. Can you--?
Uh...

143
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,571
In the bag?

144
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:48,449
Screw you, Mahone. Let's go.

145
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,787
McGrady.

146
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:55,289
McGrady.

147
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,291
I don't swim so good.

148
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,585
- What?
- Too bad, kid, you're getting wet.

149
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:00,962
Now, get in.

150
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:02,797
It's all right. We'll share tanks.

151
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:05,716
Just hold on to me, we'll switch off,
10 seconds apiece.

152
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,593
Come on, let's go.

153
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,711
- Where is Scofield?
- I don't know.

154
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,463
He didn't tell me nothing.

155
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:33,012
- Where is he running?
- I told you, I don't know nothing.

156
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,516
Well, there is only one way
to make certain of that.

157
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,476
This is General Mestas.
The men will be sent.

158
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:25,606
And, Sojo, I expect every prisoner
to be returned to Sona today.

159
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:27,233
Dispatch fourth platoon.

160
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,527
Hey, look, man.
This is getting crazy here.

161
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:33,113
Look, I'll plead guilty
for ignoring the warrant.

162
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:35,324
I'll show up for the hearing.
Let me out.

163
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,952
With these alarms and guns
are making me nervous--

164
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:41,747
Until things settle in, you go nowhere.
So just sit tight.

165
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,892
There.

166
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:30,713
Where is he?

167
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:35,259
Where is he?

168
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,885
Where is he?

169
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:43,267
- Where's who?
- Sucre with the boat.

170
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,735
Just hold on here, all right?

171
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,404
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

172
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,536
Come on, hang on.

173
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:04,872
I'm all right, I'm all right.

174
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,167
We're not gonna make it
out here too much longer, Michael.

175
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,586
Sucre is coming, be patient.

176
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,419
- I'll take it up first thing.
- Okay.

177
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,969
Excuse me.

178
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:03,764
Boat 312, why is it still here?

179
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:05,933
Wasn't someone supposed
to take that out?

180
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:09,144
Someone reserved it,
but they never picked it up.

181
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:15,234
- Yes, general.
- I want an update.

182
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,528
Still no sign of them,
nothing on the coast.

183
00:23:17,694 --> 00:23:20,030
I think they may have gone back
into the jungle.

184
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,824
The jungle?
You asked me to send men to the beach.

185
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,828
Just a moment, general.

186
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,469
General, I think we have to call
the coast guard.

187
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,633
Come on.

188
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,927
You all right?

189
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:27,389
- My legs are starting to cramp, Michael.
- You gotta hold on, buddy.

190
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:30,058
We're not gonna last out here
too long.

191
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,935
Where's your friend, Michael?

192
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:35,272
Sucre is not just gonna abandon us
out here, all right?

193
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,190
He'll show.

194
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:38,942
He'll show.

195
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,534
They've been in the water. Probably
at the bottom of the ocean by now.

196
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:50,203
Well, lookit here.

197
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,332
Looks like we have more than a drunk-
and-disorderly warrant for Jorge Rivera.

198
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,960
Failure to pay child support.

199
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:07,012
You're not going anywhere.

200
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,892
Once we're done processing you,
then you can go. Until then, sit tight.

201
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,902
I should have heard something
by now.

202
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:24,529
I've lost all damn track of them.

203
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,616
Burrows will eventually reach out
if he wants his son back.

204
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:30,786
Yeah, well,
that might no longer be an option.

205
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,101
Look! Look!

206
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:00,774
Sucre!

207
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:02,734
Sucre!

208
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,612
Sucre!

209
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:08,198
Sucre!

210
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:11,993
He's supposed to be flashing a light.

211
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:15,372
He's not responding, Linc.

212
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,794
The coast guard, they found us.

213
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:41,106
Papa.

214
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:50,574
Put your arm around me.

215
00:26:57,831 --> 00:26:59,457
Michael.

216
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:02,335
Michael, if I don't get
another chance...

217
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:05,547
...I want you to know that
I appreciate everything you've done.

218
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:07,424
You're welcome.

219
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,767
Come on, son.

220
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:31,448
- How'd you find us?
- You never showed.

221
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:34,909
You said you'd be coming from
the southwest, so I took a chance.

222
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,494
Great.

223
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,461
- What do you think happened to Sucre?
- I don't know, but we gotta move.

224
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:58,159
Guess that just leaves one.

225
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:13,007
Move.

226
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:23,768
Get up.

227
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,358
Let's go.

228
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:40,201
I saw the boxes in the back
so I took your car.

229
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:42,912
- I figured you need to change.
- Yeah.

230
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,415
- How's the ankle?
- I need to get off my feet.

231
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:49,460
All right, guys, get changed, make sure
you don't leave any wet clothes behind.

232
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:53,047
Listen, uh, thanks for everything.

233
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:56,718
Thank you for my boy.
I hope you get your son back too.

234
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:58,970
Yeah, me too.

235
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:03,641
Come, we need to get back
to the truck.

236
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,310
Michael.

237
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:09,856
Thank you.

238
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:12,233
Go be with your family, Luis.

239
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:42,680
- Yeah?
- Where the hell are you?

240
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:46,017
We ran into some trouble.
We're in downtown Panama.

241
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,438
No, Lincoln, you're not.

242
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:55,234
We got company.

243
00:30:58,488 --> 00:30:59,655
How'd they find us?

244
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:07,705
- You have them?
- We're right on top of them.

245
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,131
Okay, hold on.

246
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:28,768
They must've gotten
to McGrady's dad.

247
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:30,770
- Bugged his car.
- Or one of us.

248
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:33,439
Why didn't they find us
when we were in the water?

249
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:35,733
The water was blocking the signal.

250
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:39,070
What'd you do with that stopwatch
that Gretchen gave you?

251
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:43,866
- My God, I didn't know. I didn't know.
- Give it to me.

252
00:31:45,785 --> 00:31:46,953
Okay, hold on, guys.

253
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:06,180
All right, it's time
to use this rig to our advantage.

254
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:54,854
Here we go! Here we go!

255
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:17,126
Uh, this is looking
like a dead end right here.

256
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:18,711
Stay in the car, then.

257
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,717
This way.

258
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,085
Come on!

259
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,212
Why don't you just tell us
what you know?

260
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:04,673
And you won't wind up
being beaten half to death.

261
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,384
I know less than you do...

262
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,136
...which is hard,
considering how dumb you are.

263
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:16,852
I want everything you can find on the
men who escaped. I want it immediately.

264
00:34:20,272 --> 00:34:21,690
He has an outstanding warrant.

265
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:33,327
Go see the clerk about your stuff.

266
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:51,178
They're barricaded.

267
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:02,481
What are you doing? Get back.

268
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:05,484
All that gunfire
and they only hit your car three times?

269
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:19,957
Son of a b--

270
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:26,964
Linc, you've done a great job, but it'll be
for nothing if we end up back in the fire.

271
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:29,049
There's an exchange, then I'm done.

272
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:32,386
- You think it's that simple?
- Yeah, they want you, they get you.

273
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:35,389
This is not about me.
It's about Sofia and your son.

274
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:38,601
Michael, tell him these people
won't just let us walk away.

275
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:41,145
We already had this discussion
back at the beach.

276
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:45,065
- And you were outvoted.
- You're making a terrible mistake.

277
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:47,651
People might die because of this.

278
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:08,339
Take off your pants.

279
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:13,052
- Excuse me, señor?
- I said, take off your pants.

280
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:17,097
If I knew you boys partied
in Sona like this...

281
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:20,434
...I never would have tried to escape.

282
00:36:28,817 --> 00:36:31,028
One cell phone.

283
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,406
One wallet and some change.

284
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:37,534
There were some papers.
A boat-rental agreement, I need them.

285
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,244
I'll check the drawer.

286
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:55,469
Take them down.

287
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:56,845
Come on, now, hombre.

288
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:01,517
There's no need to refry my beans.

289
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:03,435
Always with the wise talk.

290
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,356
Never saying anything
we want to hear.

291
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:11,068
Now, all I want to hear
are your screams.

292
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:14,029
No, no, no, listen.

293
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:18,158
I told you, I don't know nothing.
No, I told you, I don't know nothing.

294
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,910
I swear. I swear I don't.

295
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,372
But he does!

296
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:26,583
He knows everything!
He knows everything!

297
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,171
Hey. Not so fast, mi amigo.

298
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:47,229
Hey, a little help.

299
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,859
- What is this place?
- Where we're gonna make the exchange.

300
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:54,695
There's a service road
in case you wanna get lost.

301
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:57,239
- Assuming you're still alive.
- You still talking?

302
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:11,086
- Linc?
- Yeah.

303
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:13,213
Gotta commend you
on that boom-box trick.

304
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,049
Very sophisticated.
You steal that one from Home Alone?

305
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:19,219
- You fell for it, bitch.
- Ha-ha-ha. If you wanna see your son--

306
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,513
Hey, you're not calling
the shots anymore.

307
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:23,348
As long as I have L.J.--

308
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:26,602
As long as I got Whistler,
you're gonna do what I say, got it?

309
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:31,899
Listen. At an abandoned warehouse,
five miles from the barrio's interchange...

310
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:34,276
...be there in 20 minutes with my son.

311
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:36,778
And once I get there?

312
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:45,495
So now we wait?

313
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,332
Yeah.

314
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:49,875
Think this will work?

315
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:52,669
Yeah, it'll work.

316
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,714
- You, me, L.J.
- Yeah.

317
00:38:55,923 --> 00:38:58,884
I just hope it works out
for McGrady too.

318
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:04,890
Oh, no.

319
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:10,479
They must have closed
all the roads out of Panama.

320
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:12,439
Papa, what do we do?

321
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:18,737
You gotta turn around, Papa.

322
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:20,948
I can't go back to Sona. I can't.

323
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:30,791
I don't care what he says.

324
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,960
He's a convict.
He's a piece of garbage.

325
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:35,629
I don't know anything
about this Michael Scofield.

326
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:38,840
General, here is everything we have
on the escaped prisoners.

327
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:48,809
- You don't know Scofield, is that right?
- Yes.

328
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:52,979
You sure you don't wanna change
your story, Fernando?

329
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,033
Hey, this should help
make you a decent brace.

330
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,327
Thank you.

331
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:13,500
Hey.

332
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,128
We should be able to see them
coming from up here.

333
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:18,213
You know, Linc...

334
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:20,674
...you did great.

335
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,805
Thanks.

336
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:29,015
I just want L.J. back, you know?

337
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:31,893
- It's just a matter of time.
- Yeah.

338
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,313
Considering I don't have a pony
in this race...

339
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:37,858
...I guess
this is where I say goodbye.

340
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:50,537
You think I'm gonna
let you just walk out of here...

341
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,038
...after what you did to us?

342
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,458
After what you did to my dad?

343
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,545
- No.
- I was gonna kill you at the beach...

344
00:40:58,712 --> 00:41:02,257
...but I didn't wanna do anything
that was gonna get us caught.

345
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,176
You shot my dad in the back.

346
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:07,429
I'll give you the courtesy
you never gave him.

347
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:09,431
Now, turn around.

348
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:13,560
Turn around.

349
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,188
Linc, think about
what you're doing.

350
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:21,276
I was told to choose
between your family and mine.

351
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:24,112
That was my option. I chose mine.

352
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:27,282
Go to hell.

353
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:29,993
Linc, you don't have to do this.

354
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,418
Mahone!

355
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,868
Hey, my truck.

356
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:15,538
No.

357
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:29,844
What are we gonna do now?
