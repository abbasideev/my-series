1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,752
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:06,297
I want a presidential pardon
for me and my brother.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,758
Tell me what's going on,
I can take care of you.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,512
All I need you to do is tell me exactly
what Agent Mahone told you.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,556
I have a job to do, a job that I'm
being made to do. Pick up the ph--

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,185
Wait. Stay right where you are.

7
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,233
Hey.

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,825
I know where you can get it.
Five million dollars.

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,577
- Where is it?
- I could take you there...

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,330
...if you don't take me back
to the States, turn me in.

11
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,167
- Three tickets. One cabin, one-way.
- Nice.

12
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,754
Sir, in just a few minutes the president
is going to announce a pardon...

13
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,214
...for Burrows and Scofield.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,385
I regret to inform you,
I am stepping down...

15
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,888
...as president of the United States.

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
There's only one thing we can do.

17
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,893
We gotta disappear. Forever.

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,095
Very heavy.

19
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,181
What have you got in there?

20
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,058
About 75 pounds
of none-of-your-business, Pedro.

21
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,477
For your troubles.

22
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,660
Go, go, go!

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,833
T-Bag, T-Bag.

24
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,668
T-Bag, please, I need that money.

25
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,129
- Andale, you son of a bitch.
- Please, please.

26
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,006
I'm begging you. Please.

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,467
Please. No.

28
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,311
What time does the ship leave?

29
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,230
Ten minutes.

30
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,357
I can't believe we're running again.

31
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,234
- It's different now, man.
- You think so?

32
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,985
Yeah. We brought the bitch down.

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,696
- She stepped down, Linc.
- Because of us.

34
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,699
And yet you're still wanted for murder.

35
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,328
When you came to Fox River,
remember what you said?

36
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,832
You said, "I'm gonna break you out
of here." I'm alive. You did that.

37
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,376
You wanna look for the good,
you look there.

38
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,878
Come on,
let's just finish what you started.

39
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,182
Continuing with our top story...

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,184
...Caroline Reynolds made
the announcement...

41
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,687
...just a short while ago
that she is stepping down...

42
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,397
...as president of the United States.

43
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,232
We'll be bringing you more information--

44
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,488
- Hello?
- Hey, are you all right?

45
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,867
Yeah, I'm fine. I just heard
about the president. What does it mean?

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,577
It means it's time to go.

47
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,745
Okay. When?

48
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,622
Ten minutes. How far away are you?

49
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,999
Five.

50
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,169
Listen, Sara, Linc and I are on the ship.

51
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,591
This is it.
There's no turning back now, so, uh...

52
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,926
I know it's not what you wanted
from your life...

53
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:43,222
...but in case you're interested,
there is room for one more.

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,226
Michael Scofield, you asking me
to sail off into the sunset with you?

55
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,354
Well, it's more of a freighter,
but, uh, yes.

56
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,607
I'll be there.

57
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,443
I'll see you soon.

58
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,453
She's heading west on Leadwell.

59
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,081
All right. Stay on her.
I'll be right there.

60
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,961
What the hell's this?

61
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,130
I tried, boss.
You saw how he just took off.

62
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,426
The only thing I'm seeing is an escaped
con who's begging to be taken note.

63
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,011
Okay. Okay, look.

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,514
Maybe we can call the cab company and
find out where T-Bag was dropped off.

65
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,808
Yeah, now you're talking.
I saw some phones--

66
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,230
What's it gonna take for you
to forget you ever found us?

67
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,441
There ain't enough pesos in TJ.

68
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,904
- Are you sure about that?
- Go ahead, shoot.

69
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,656
But it might not be the best idea...

70
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,159
...seeing as how I'm the only one who
knows where your chiquita's tied up.

71
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,244
Where is Maricruz?

72
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,330
If I tell you, I'm as good as dead.

73
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,083
Of course, if you shoot, so is she.

74
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,962
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

75
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,925
Let me tell you in words
you might be more familiar with.

76
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,179
She's in the hole. Enough food and
water to last about three weeks.

77
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,848
Any longer than that,
your sweet little plum's...

78
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,850
...gonna dry up like a raisin.

79
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,353
- If anything happens to her, so help me--
- Help you?

80
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,189
The way I see it,
it's you who's gotta help me.

81
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:19,026
You ain't getting your hands on that girl
till I get my hands on that money.

82
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,530
Guess that makes us partners.

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,660
Clear the dock of any obstructions.

84
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,453
Here we go.

85
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,831
She's not here.

86
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,335
Yeah?

87
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,504
Sara, what's the matter?
The ship is leaving.

88
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,430
- Michael...
- What's wrong?

89
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,145
Sara?

90
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,730
I'm already onboard.

91
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm sorry, I must've just missed you.
Where are you?

92
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,571
- We're on deck.
- Great.

93
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,284
I'm on my way up. Love you.

94
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,958
We good?

95
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,545
Yeah.

96
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,023
You have the right to remain silent.

97
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,651
Son of a bitch.

98
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,196
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

99
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,823
...one will be provided for you.

100
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,409
Where is he?

101
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,286
- I don't know.
- No more games, Sara.

102
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,664
- You were on your way to see him.
- No, I wasn't.

103
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,084
You were just compelled
to flee the custody of a federal agent?

104
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,883
All lines astern are loose.

105
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,927
Prepare for cast off.

106
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,428
I couldn't find her.

107
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,268
Sara. We gotta go back.

108
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,979
- There's nothing you can do.
- Always something we can do.

109
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,730
Not this time.

110
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,484
Not this time. It's done.

111
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,778
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,532
- Scofield or prison?
- I just wanted a doughnut.

113
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,745
Get her a doughnut.
Can we get her one?

114
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,832
Get her a doughnut.
Get her a dozen doughnuts. Lock her up.

115
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,445
May, May, May, New Mexico.

116
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,213
Don't, don't, don't...

117
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,017
Where the hell did you go, Michael?

118
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,812
So where the hell is Mahone?

119
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,314
I don't know.
He's been MIA for the last week or so.

120
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,484
You think he knows
I've been barking up one of his trees?

121
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,737
Mr. Franklin, good afternoon.

122
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,283
This is Richard Sullins,
director of internal affairs at the FBI.

123
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,577
Which means whenever one
of our people does something wrong...

124
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,330
...it's my job to make it right.

125
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,082
How right are we talking about?

126
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,750
Well, let's be clear.

127
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,794
You are a convicted felon.

128
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,838
You broke out of a state penitentiary.

129
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,008
- I can only do so much.
- Well, there's only so much I can say.

130
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,677
Now, I'm sorry
if I seem a little bit skeptical...

131
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,180
...but the last time a federal agent
came up in here offering me a deal...

132
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,934
...there was a string attached that
I was supposed to put around my neck.

133
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,520
I've been authorized
to, uh, offer you a reduced sentence...

134
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,148
...in exchange for your testimony
against Agent Mahone.

135
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,025
Instead of 18 years,
you get 18 months.

136
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,609
Eighteen months?

137
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,029
Hey, you know what?
That man tried to kill me.

138
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,197
So as soon as he finds out
that I'm singing...

139
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,450
...I probably won't even last 18 days.

140
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,453
- Mr. Franklin--
- He threatened my family.

141
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,955
Now, I need to be out there
protecting them.

142
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:12,713
So until you can offer me something like
that, I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

143
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,632
Guard.

144
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,386
Free man.

145
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,013
You and your family.

146
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,641
Witness protection, fresh start.

147
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,062
- Clean record?
- Spick-and-span.

148
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,485
You put that in writing
and you got yourself a witness.

149
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,122
Sir?

150
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,376
I knocked, but, uh...

151
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,171
You okay?

152
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,217
What does that look like to you?
There, right there.

153
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,512
- It's a triangle.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

154
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,725
How about this? Right there.

155
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,936
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

156
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,231
Three-point-one-four.
I'm thinking date, area code.

157
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,609
Three-one-four, that's Missouri.
So you think Scofield's there?

158
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,153
I doubt it.
How's your Greek alphabet, Agent Lang?

159
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,198
I don't know. I guess it's...

160
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,453
What if I told you that triangle
was a delta? And that this--

161
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,581
This here was not the symbol pi,
but the letter.

162
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,584
I didn't see those
in the photos of the tattoos.

163
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,295
They weren't. We pulled these
from his original sketches.

164
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,797
They're off the hard drive.

165
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,926
Scofield numbered
the steps of his escape.

166
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,928
That's how he kept everything in order.

167
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,389
But it looks like
that he didn't use numbers...

168
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,142
...that he used letters,
like, um, ha-ha...

169
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,978
The sketch of this tattoo.
Allen Schweitzer.

170
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,773
Marked with an alpha, first letter of
the Greek alphabet. First step in his plan.

171
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,985
Epsilon, fifth letter of the
Greek alphabet. Fifth step in his plan.

172
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,196
Here's theta, kappa.

173
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,615
How about that? Tau.
Be at the border, right?

174
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,743
- Getting closer to the end. You with me?
- So you think...

175
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,162
His omega.

176
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,915
- The last letter of the Greek alphabet--
- Is the last step of his plan.

177
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,503
What is that? Christ in a flower?

178
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,839
- Rose.
- And these numbers, 617.

179
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,133
Could be biblical. Chapter six, verse 17.

180
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,927
Six-one-seven, 617. June 17th.

181
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,264
- Oh, what's today?
- Fifteenth.

182
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,767
- So whatever his last step is--
- It's gonna happen in two days.

183
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,866
- What's he saying?
- Nothing, the same as the rest.

184
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,119
Maybe he don't comprende.
What's Spanish for INS?

185
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,788
Don't be stupid. We're in Mexico.
You're the illegal one here.

186
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,124
It doesn't mean he ain't
got family up north...

187
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,168
...trying to clean their way
to a green card.

188
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,170
He knows what I'm talking about.

189
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,919
Oh, you are too good to me, Suzy-Q.

190
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,463
Mm.

191
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,715
Just how I like it.

192
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,137
How did I get so lucky?

193
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,392
Oh, no, Teddy Bear. I'm the lucky one.

194
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,607
The day I met you...

195
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,861
...was the day I was born.

196
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,868
- We're out of time.
- No, Susan.

197
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,288
We got our whole lives together.

198
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,082
No, I mean the hour is up.

199
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,167
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

200
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,212
It's just, we're rolling here,
so let's, you know, get back.

201
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,590
How's the-- What's cooking,
good-looking?

202
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,009
I would really feel better
if you paid me up-front.

203
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,928
I told you up-front that
if you did this right,

204
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,014
I would take care of you, so...

205
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,891
You paid me for an hour.

206
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,352
The hour's up.

207
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,229
If you want me to stay,
I need more money.

208
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,774
Great. Great, you ruined it. Thanks.

209
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,987
You know, for a second, I was like:

210
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,031
"This chick has a brain in her head."

211
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,326
Then, if you did,
you wouldn't be a street whore, right?

212
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:57,122
You know, I don't know
who this Suzy-Q bitch is...

213
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,541
...but no wonder she wants nothing
to do with you.

214
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,713
You didn't just call her a bitch, did you?

215
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,382
Okay.

216
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,593
I'm going to count to three.

217
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,221
And if you don't put your arm down,
I'm going to scream.

218
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,267
One. Two--

219
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,092
We made it.

220
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,968
Not yet.

221
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,263
First, there's someone we need to see.

222
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,270
Okay, who's got what?

223
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,399
Christ as a rose. It's a common theme
that runs through the Bible.

224
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,442
Martin Luther adopted it,
his coat of arms.

225
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,986
And there's a belief
that Christ rose from the dead.

226
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:14,533
And since this is Scofield's final step, uh,
a new life, could be something there.

227
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,285
You, keep track of this on the board.
On the board.

228
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,622
- Where's Wheeler?
- Here we go.

229
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,125
Harmonists. First settlers
of New Harmony, Indiana.

230
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,460
Used a golden rose
as their symbol for Christ.

231
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,630
- That's a reach.
- There's a flower called Christmas rose.

232
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,632
Wasn't Christ Rose
the German code name...

233
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,428
...for, uh, the counterattack by the Nazis
that led to the Battle of the Bulge?

234
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,846
Where was that?

235
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,557
Ardennes Forest.
On the Belgium-Germany border.

236
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,144
Not a bad place to hide,
if they can find it.

237
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,645
So you gonna look into that?

238
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,439
- Yeah.
- All right, what else?

239
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,858
Christ potentially rose
from the dead on Easter.

240
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,193
- Easter Sunday?
- Easter Seals?

241
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,036
Who's got Scofield's file?

242
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,289
Um, here we go.

243
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,553
Christ in a rose.

244
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,931
- Yeah, what about it?
- Scofield's mother's name.

245
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,268
- Ugh.
- "Christina Rose" Scofield.

246
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,853
Hmm, but I thought she was dead.

247
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,772
Well, so did I.

248
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,859
So did I.

249
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,450
First thing that Scofield did
when they broke out of Fox River...

250
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,077
...is pick up supplies
that he had stashed in a grave.

251
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,997
I want you to find out
where Scofield's mother's buried.

252
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,999
And what?

253
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,085
- And see if she's buried.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,879
- What about Panama?
- What about Panama?

255
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:55,091
We found his hard drive. It was full of
information about Panama in particular.

256
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,677
Which he knows you have.
Guy's got all kinds of hubris.

257
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,262
But he's smart enough
to stay out...

258
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,473
...of a country where
he knows you'll be waiting.

259
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,017
Unless there's something there
that he needs.

260
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,852
Or someone.

261
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,771
I want a map of Panama.

262
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,899
And find out if Scofield's mom,
Christina Rose...

263
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:15,362
...has any family in Central America,
any property, anything.

264
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,918
Last time I was in a bus like this
I was heading to Fox River.

265
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,962
Man, this country's amazing.

266
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,922
It's beautiful.

267
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,593
- What's that smell, man?
- Bananas and sugar cane.

268
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,512
It's Panama's biggest exports.

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,930
Come on, man.

270
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,517
You've been talking about Panama and
bumpy bus rides ever since we broke out.

271
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,728
- And now we're actually doing it--
- She should've been here with us.

272
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,233
We got all the time in the world for that.
Someplace down the track, you and Sara--

273
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,527
Can we just get there, please?

274
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,447
Sure.

275
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,686
So far, no hits on any connection
between Scofield's mother and Panama.

276
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,981
But there are 38 listings of Christina
Rose in various combinations...

277
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,067
...of first name, middle name
and last name.

278
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,487
All right, cross-reference the names
with the number 617 from the tattoo.

279
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,656
Maybe it's not a date.
See if it's an address.

280
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,741
- Got it.
- If anybody pops, call the embassy.

281
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,119
Have them send an officer
to pick up the woman for questioning.

282
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,498
Um, I don't think we can just arrest
a foreign citizen without--

283
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,750
Patriot Act.
I could arrest your grandmother...

284
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,669
...for missing a stitch in her macramé.

285
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,047
If anybody's helping Scofield, dead
or alive, I wanna know who they are.

286
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,349
That her?

287
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,017
Yeah.

288
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,193
Hola, Mrs. Vasquez.

289
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,279
You are late. It's much later
than the date you said.

290
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,282
Well, we ran into a little bit of trouble.

291
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,867
Who is this?

292
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,745
It's a business associate.

293
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,083
Christina Rose. I remember.

294
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,751
You will find her here.

295
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,927
Oh, um...
I'll meet you outside.

296
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,929
I forgot to ask something.

297
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,347
All right.

298
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,563
Do you have a phone I could use?

299
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,322
Yes, uh, I need an international operator,
please.

300
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,616
United States.

301
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:53,038
It's, uh, 312-346--

302
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,123
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

303
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,958
You can't.

304
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,668
We don't even know if she's alive.

305
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,921
If Sara's in custody, they got her phone.

306
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,132
You wanna get caught?

307
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,777
- Yeah?
- Three things I hate, Alex.

308
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:28,239
Traffic, hockey, and calling you
with the same question over and over.

309
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,493
Then don't call me anymore.
But I believe the brothers are in Panama.

310
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,702
Is that so?

311
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,746
The key to where
is on Scofield's tattoos.

312
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,208
While I'm thrilled
you've narrowed it down to a country...

313
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,251
...that's not why we're talking.

314
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,295
Benjamin Miles Franklin is alive.

315
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,838
I'm aware of that, yeah.

316
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,841
And being released from custody.

317
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,511
Not possible. They would
need permission from my office.

318
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,513
Good to know you're on top of things.

319
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,525
Find me Agent Wheeler.

320
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,862
He'll see you now.

321
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,838
Forgive me for asking, sir, but
couldn't we be doing this in my office?

322
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,048
It'd be much more comfortable.

323
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,303
I felt we needed to speak freely.

324
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,181
For the next several hours,
this is what those...

325
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,310
...in the intelligence community refer to
as a blind spot.

326
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,022
Something to do with the position
of the sun, I'm told.

327
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,984
Disrupts long-distance recording devices.

328
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,238
If I may apologize again, sir...

329
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,324
...for the unfortunate outcome
with the president.

330
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,451
I know how important she was
to our interests.

331
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,120
I assure you that moving forward--

332
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,914
You won't be moving anywhere
until you can explain to me...

333
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,791
...how this happened.

334
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,546
The brothers.

335
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,549
- They're making it--
- Still alive?

336
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,848
Yes. It appears they were able
to flee the country.

337
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,516
To where?

338
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,727
Mr. Mahone seems to believe
they're in Panama.

339
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:33,615
Does our Mr. Mahone know
where exactly in Panama they are?

340
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,784
Not yet. Why?

341
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,288
How much do you know
about Sona, Mr. Kim?

342
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,248
Only what I've been given clearance on.

343
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:48,796
Perhaps what our situation requires
is a change in strategy.

344
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,054
How long till the court
approves the arrest warrant?

345
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,555
Any time now.

346
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,557
Just waiting for the indictment
to come down.

347
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,392
Okay. Well, I've got a question for you.

348
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,978
What if he's in there?
I can't keep avoiding him.

349
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,522
He reads people. That's what he does.

350
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,442
If he finds out I'm involved,
I'm gonna need protection from--

351
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,779
Wheeler, relax. Take a breath.

352
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,616
The only thing Mahone can read is what
you write for him. Can you act normal?

353
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,159
That's all you have to do.

354
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,328
We don't want him to get spooked
and take off.

355
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,829
This is all gonna be over soon.

356
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,165
All right. Thank you.

357
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,167
No. Thank you.

358
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,634
Wheeler.

359
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,011
Where you been?

360
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,815
I gotta do this.

361
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,028
What are you doing, Alex?
I'm not wearing a wire.

362
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:58,491
- You gonna tell me what's going on here?
- In Old England...

363
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,704
...the punishment for a traitorous act
was beheading.

364
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,874
Following the execution, they would
hold up the severed head by the hair.

365
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,295
Not for the crowd to see the head,
but for the head to see the crowd...

366
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,132
...because consciousness sticks around
for another eight seconds.

367
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,218
Idea was that it would give the
traitor one more chance to take--

368
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,138
You don't wanna do this, okay?
Just take a moment--

369
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,391
If you're gonna stab me in the back,
Agent Wheeler...

370
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,393
...be smart enough
to cover up the knife.

371
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,729
You go and visit Franklin
three times this week.

372
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,856
Called Sullins, what, twice a day?

373
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,066
Didn't you learn anything
working for me?

374
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,611
You gotta cover your tracks,
unless you...

375
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,034
Unless you wanna get caught.

376
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,622
You wanted me to know it was you.

377
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,713
- You're a killer, Alex.
- Is that so?

378
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,967
Soil samples from your yard connected
with the disappearance of Oscar Shales.

379
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,846
Forensics is prepared to submit a
report detailing the irregularities...

380
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,265
...in the shooting
of David "Tweener" Apolskis.

381
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,810
There's your blatant disregard for
protocol in the death of John Abruzzi--

382
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,272
And the escaped con who says
that I told him to kill himself, I know.

383
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,319
You think his testimony is gonna
send you to the Promised Land?

384
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,407
You can erase me too.

385
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,576
But it's not gonna erase
the very real fact...

386
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,829
...that you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison.

387
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,248
You know...

388
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,505
You remind me of myself
when I was a young agent.

389
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,423
What?

390
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,676
I wish I could take that
as a compliment.

391
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,181
That's some real fine work, Wheeler.

392
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,016
Good job, though.

393
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:53,022
Don't you let anyone scare you
into doing the wrong thing.

394
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,028
Let me take you in.

395
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,364
Whatever mess you're in,
we can clean it up.

396
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,158
There's only one way to clean this.
One way.

397
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,502
Hey, you got a visitor.

398
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,796
- Yeah, who?
- I don't know.

399
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,631
I was just instructed to bring you.

400
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,468
I ain't going nowhere until you tell
me who it is I'm meeting, all right?

401
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,888
You guys, just stop it.
Listen to me for a second.

402
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,890
That's all you gotta do,
go out and check.

403
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,560
Look, the guy's kind of tall, okay?

404
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,980
It's the least that you can do, huh?

405
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,403
- What the...?
- Daddy.

406
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,821
Oh, my God.

407
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,740
Come here. Oh.

408
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,202
Daddy loves you so much.

409
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,923
So, um, is it real?

410
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:06,387
He says you're gonna go free,
that, um, we don't have to run anymore.

411
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,682
- What happened? What changed?
- Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,184
Now, don't you worry about it.

413
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,436
You just know that your man
handles things.

414
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,397
Ain't that right? That's right.

415
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
Okay. I don't believe it, but okay.

416
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,447
Benjamin, if I could just have
a quick word.

417
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,075
Yeah. Hey...

418
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,622
Why don't you, uh, go down the hall
for just a quick second, okay?

419
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,457
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

420
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,964
Here it is.

421
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,883
New address, new identities.

422
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,886
The prosecutor's gonna be
in touch to go over your testimony.

423
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,723
So you just make sure you show up
where he says and when he says.

424
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,600
Yeah, okay, okay.

425
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:54,977
But I'm a free man, right?

426
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,313
Free man.

427
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,236
Oh, wait a minute.
What about Mahone, you know?

428
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,405
I don't wanna be looking
over my shoulder for the rest of my life.

429
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,909
You let me worry about Mahone. You
just worry about staying out of trouble.

430
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,954
Hey, you ain't gonna have a problem
with that. Trust me.

431
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,039
Don't screw it up.

432
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,770
How much further?

433
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,647
Not far.

434
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:44,026
You know, for what it's worth,
no one forced Sara to do what she did.

435
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,113
Whatever gets you through the night.

436
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,865
What the hell does that mean?
I didn't ask you to use her.

437
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,492
It's not that simple.

438
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,538
- Whatever gets you through the night.
- You know what amazes me, Linc?

439
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,708
Nothing ever registers with you. Ever.

440
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,043
It just rolls right off your back,
doesn't it?

441
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,046
We ruin Sara's life
and it's like you don't even care.

442
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:07,174
- Is that what you think?
- We're here, and Sara's back in prison.

443
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,135
- Does that seem fair?
- None of it's fair.

444
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,138
- Don't make this about boy loses girl.
- Who should it be about?

445
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,140
Westmoreland? Tweener?

446
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,808
- L.J.?
- Let me stop you there.

447
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,228
Remember the name of the guard
murdered because of the riot I started?

448
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,230
- Shut up.
- Do you even remember his name?

449
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,025
- Shut up.
- You remember Veronica's, don't you?

450
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,777
- Mention her again, I swear to God!
- What about T-Bag?

451
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,529
He's out there now because of us.

452
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,239
You and me.

453
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:39,123
Every life he takes,
that's blood on our hands.

454
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,000
And for what?

455
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,630
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

456
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,923
They were gonna kill you, Linc.

457
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,759
Well, maybe you should've let them.

458
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,428
Take that back.

459
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,209
As bad as I feel about Sara,
she had a choice.

460
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,253
Veronica didn't.

461
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,258
I listened to her die, Michael.

462
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,720
I listened to her die,
and there was nothing I could do.

463
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,139
Nothing.

464
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,980
We've lost so much, man.

465
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,651
We can't afford to lose each other.

466
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,696
We just can't.

467
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,725
Going somewhere, Alex?

468
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,852
I don't know. Am I?

469
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:27,064
Ha. Come on. You know I don't like
to get my hands dirty.

470
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,033
It's surprising the things a man will do
when properly motivated.

471
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,663
Wasn't it you who told me that?

472
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,374
You know, I would kill you right now...

473
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,960
...if I thought it would give me
an ounce of peace.

474
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,964
And what would give you peace?

475
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,178
I've been able to hold it together
through all this...

476
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,723
...because there was a light
at the end of the tunnel.

477
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:06,562
A life at the end of the tunnel
for me, for my family.

478
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,314
And now what?

479
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:12,276
Do you see my son?
Do you see my wife?

480
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,321
What have I got?
What have you given me?

481
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,324
What if I was to tell you...

482
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:24,371
...that there was something
that could turn that light back on?

483
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,748
What would you say?

484
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,001
I'd say that's the same offer you made
when you dragged me into this.

485
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,797
And look where it's got me now.
They're gonna drag me before the public.

486
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,091
They're gonna prosecute me
like some kind of murderer.

487
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:40,846
There's evidence, really hard, tangible
evidence that you can't take away.

488
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,932
You're right.

489
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,101
But I can help you get away.

490
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,773
And at this point, I don't think
you've got any other options.

491
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,447
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell
was apprehended in Mexico.

492
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,241
Oh, let me guess, you want him dead.

493
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,784
Oh, no.

494
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,622
There's been a, uh, change in strategy.

495
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,123
We're gonna need him alive.

496
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,628
I'm talking about
a very real finish line here, Alex.

497
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,256
You've come so far.

498
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,133
How much further would I have to go?

499
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,344
Well, you're lucky.

500
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,055
For this, you only have to go to Panama.

501
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,858
I'm trying to remember the last time
our lives made any kind of sense.

502
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,906
Before Mom died,
when it was just the three of us.

503
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,412
Well, there she is.

504
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,754
Hello, Lang.

505
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,174
What's going on? I mean, there's suits
here going through your office.

506
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,968
I'll explain later.

507
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,096
All right. Um...

508
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,724
- Did you get the fax?
- No, why?

509
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,183
What do you got?

510
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,853
Information on Christina Rose
you might find interesting.

511
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,314
Looks like she was commissioned
about four months...

512
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,316
...before Scofield robbed that bank...

513
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,860
...by a builder in Panama
named Amparo Vasquez.

514
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,695
Son of a bitch.

515
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,749
She's beautiful.

516
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,043
Yeah, she's not the real thing, but...

517
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,753
So where to, man?

518
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,047
Anywhere we want.

519
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:48,891
So is it really over?

520
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,893
Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's really over.

521
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,728
Okay.

522
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,700
What is it, baby?

523
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,663
Huh?

524
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,625
Ha. Nothing.

525
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,961
Let's go home.

526
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,768
Okay, so we checked the train station
in Malinalco, the bus depot in Puebla...

527
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,356
...and just about every hotel there is.

528
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,276
Hello.
Hey, hey, hey, slow down, Sancho.

529
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,656
For you.

530
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,292
That was the guy from the tourism
bureau. He found him.

531
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,711
Where?

532
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,297
An E. Stammel just boarded a plane
to Panama City.

533
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,508
What the hell's he doing in Panama?

534
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,659
Speak English?

535
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,329
Say, uh, "Good morning, Teddy."

536
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,331
Good morning, Teddy.

537
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,001
So then actually, no,
you don't speak English.

538
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,961
Hablaany inglésaround here?

539
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,765
Say, "Good morning, Teddy."

540
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,850
Good morning, Teddy.

541
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,937
Say, "Good morning, Teddy Bear."

542
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,690
Good morning, Teddy Bear.

543
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,860
You like wigs?

544
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,030
For the right money, I like anything.

545
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,401
There's nothing.

546
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,737
Nothing online about Sara's arrest.

547
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,239
Maybe they're keeping it quiet.

548
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,242
What about the message board?
The Gold Finch thing.

549
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:58,580
Just something from C-Note,
and there is a message from Sucre.

550
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,791
Still running, huh?

551
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,545
What?

552
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:11,426
Sucre says T-Bag's here, in Panama.

553
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,262
How the hell did he know?

554
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,931
I don't know.
He says, "The Bag still has the bag.

555
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,725
He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

556
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,561
If you're there and want to help put...

557
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,021
...that bird back in the cage,
let me know. Sucre."

558
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,190
What is that son of a bitch doing
in Panama?

559
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,276
- We gotta go after him.
- Just let it be.

560
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,820
- We don't need the money.
- It's not about the money, Linc.

561
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,905
Whatever good we do
from here on out...

562
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,991
...doesn't matter as long
as T-Bag's out there.

563
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,450
Michael, we made it. All we--

564
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,452
Much has gone wrong.
If we could just...

565
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,289
if we could just make this right.

566
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,334
Panama City is only an hour away.
And now we know where he's staying.

567
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,211
Call the police.

568
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,339
There's a reason I chose Panama.
There's no extradition laws.

569
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,008
They're not gonna touch him.

570
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,051
So, what are you gonna do?

571
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,179
I'll figure something out.

572
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,682
Figure it out? You don't take a piss
without a plan, man. Come on.

573
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,851
Look, I never think,
and look where it got me.

574
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,895
Yeah, in Panama
with a boatload of booze.

575
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,189
You got me that.
I got me a death sentence.

576
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:10,360
Look, let's just get out to sea,
think things through.

577
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,071
When the time's right,
we make it right.

578
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,991
Okay?

579
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:39,723
Trans-Panamanian
Airlines flight 271 to Panama...

580
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,392
...now boarding
all first-class passengers.

581
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,771
Again, we're boarding
for Panama City.

582
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,856
See you soon.

583
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,320
Home, sweet home.

584
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,745
I got the booze, but the limes are shot.

585
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,086
Michael?

586
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,589
Michael!

587
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,176
Michael.
