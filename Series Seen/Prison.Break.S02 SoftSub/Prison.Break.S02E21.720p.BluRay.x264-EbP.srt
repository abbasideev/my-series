1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,377
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:03,795
So where to, man?

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,172
Anywhere we want.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,219
I'm not the brother you remember.
I've changed.

5
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:13,012
And I am gonna do something...

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,348
...a lot of people
are gonna think is horrible.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:20,144
And you just remember
the brother you grew up with.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,480
She's not here.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,733
- Yeah?
- Sara, the ship is leaving.

10
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,236
I'm already onboard.

11
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,363
Love you.

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,450
Why are you telling me this now?

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,495
If I had to do it all over again...

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,580
...I'd do it different, you know.

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,000
Collarbone and rotator cuff.

16
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,086
Six inches to the right and you're dead.

17
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,589
- You've come so far.
- How much further would I have to go?

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,925
You're lucky. For this,
you only have to go to Panama.

19
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,095
- He found him.
- Where?

20
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,432
- Just boarded a plane to Panama City.
- What's he doing in Panama?

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,894
- You like wigs?
- For the right money, I like anything.

22
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,278
What about the message board?
The Goldfinch thing?

23
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,156
- There is a message from Sucre.
- Still running, huh?

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,032
He says, "The Bag still has the bag.

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,326
He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,121
If you're there and wanna help
put that bird in the cage...

27
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,374
- ...let me know. Sucre."
- See you soon.

28
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:50,401
Michael!

29
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,731
Scofield, one thing's for sure.
You're just as pretty as advertised.

30
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,652
- Prettier even.
- You've gotta help me. Please.

31
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,372
I'm coming for you. Are you ready?

32
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,916
No.

33
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm coming for you...

34
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,762
Say a word and I will cut
your throat out, you old whore.

35
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,768
Scofield.

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,085
- Hello.
- Pam, it's me.

37
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,004
- Uh, Cam's napping.
- Yeah? How's he doing?

38
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,508
Good. It was his first day
back in school.

39
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,843
- That's great.
- Where are you?

40
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,763
I'm out of the country.

41
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,181
Is everything all right?

42
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:13,479
Remember how I always said that
the day would come and I'd be done?

43
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:18,275
- Leave the Bureau and never look back?
- Yes.

44
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,653
Today's that day.

45
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,655
I have one more thing to do.

46
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,490
And once I do it...

47
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,537
...everything is gonna fall into place
and I'll be done.

48
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,206
- Well, I hope you mean it.
- Pam.

49
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,502
If I didn't have this job anymore,
or if I were free...

50
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,379
If I were free...

51
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:42,633
- Alex.
- I need to know.

52
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,137
I'm not saying no.

53
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,226
I will make this right, I swear to God.

54
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,354
And you and me and Cam...

55
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,399
I have to go.

56
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,193
I've never stopped loving you, Pam.

57
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,405
- Ever.
- Just be safe, Alex.

58
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,831
- You in position?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,168
- I'll be there in 10 minutes.
- Got it.

60
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,538
Michael.

61
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,624
What's wrong?

62
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,210
Quepasa, Scofield?

63
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,381
Come on, move it.

64
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,805
I love it.

65
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,683
Mr. Above-It-All down here
trying to sniff out that 5 million...

66
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,560
...just like the rest of us riff-raff.

67
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,312
See, you ain't no better than me.

68
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,315
I want T-Bag locked up.
That's the only reason I'm here.

69
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,151
Oh, Dudley freaking Do-Right, huh?

70
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,154
- I didn't know you were here.
- What are you talking about?

71
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,907
You e-mailed me, said T-Bag was here.
It's on the website.

72
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,285
What? No.
I didn't write anything on no website.

73
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,829
To you or anybody else.

74
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,248
Is T-Bag in that hotel?

75
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,502
Yeah, and a couple of feds
staking it out across the street.

76
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,506
- You're gonna help us get it.
- You missed the part about the feds.

77
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,884
I don't care. I didn't travel 2000 miles
down the Diarrhea Trail...

78
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,971
...to get to this backward-ass country
to not get my 5 million.

79
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,349
Well, that's too bad. This is looking
more and more like a setup.

80
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,978
Well, then, get that little
college boy brain of yours to work, then.

81
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,938
And if you don't think I'm serious...

82
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,858
...just ask your old cellie here
what length I'll go to.

83
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,527
He's got Maricruz
locked away somewhere.

84
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,282
Either I help him get the money,
or she's dead.

85
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,369
Yeah, I'm a big jerk, Scofield.
Shame on me.

86
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,791
Michael, I'm in no position
to ask you for anything.

87
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,171
I need your help, papi.

88
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,798
I do.

89
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,054
Are you in, or what?

90
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,091
- Get the gun off me.
- I asked you a question.

91
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,594
I said get the gun off me, or I walk.

92
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,560
All right, you'll get your 5 million...

93
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,564
...you get Maricruz and I get T-Bag.

94
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,859
- Win-win-win.
- But you gotta do exactly what I say.

95
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,114
Thank you, bro.

96
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,869
All right, Einstein.

97
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,287
What you thinking?

98
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,708
And it's the third day of testimony...

99
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,877
...in the trial of Dr. Sara Tancredi...

100
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,546
...daughter of the late
Governor Frank Tancredi.

101
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,341
So far, pundits feel the prosecution
is well on its way...

102
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,178
...to meeting its burden of proof
and getting a conviction on all counts.

103
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,138
Defense counsel, you may proceed.

104
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,935
Your Honor, at this time, I ask that
this tape be marked Defense Exhibit D.

105
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,480
Objection. Your Honor,
this tape is the very propaganda...

106
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,025
...that Michael Scofield and Lincoln
Burrows released to the media...

107
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,944
...that was summarily debunked.

108
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,822
- The jury still has a right to hear it.
- The tape is hearsay.

109
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,323
Unavailable Witness Exception.

110
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,827
The witness is only unavailable
because he's a fugitive on the run.

111
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:24,623
Be that as it may, his statement
on this tape exonerates Dr. Tancredi.

112
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,333
Your Honor...

113
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,877
The tape is allowed.

114
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,880
The State's objection
will be noted in the record.

115
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,762
Much blame has been placed on another
innocent person, Dr. Sara Tancredi.

116
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,849
She had nothing to do
with our escape.

117
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,353
Sara, if you're listening, I know
I can't ask you for another chance.

118
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,689
I only hope by now,
you've found your safe haven.

119
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,776
The trial of
the late Governor Tancredi's daughter...

120
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,238
...Dr. Sara Tancredi,
continues today in Cook County.

121
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,366
Dr. Tancredi, whose medical license
has been suspended...

122
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:04,371
...pending the outcome of the trial,
is facing multiple counts, ranging--

123
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,942
- I'm gonna kill him.
- And go back to prison.

124
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,318
I don't care.

125
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,863
Once we get the money and he tells me
where Maricruz is, I'm gonna kill him.

126
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,826
If you find Maricruz, you'll marry
Maricruz and live happily ever after.

127
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,954
Yeah, after I sink a knife
in Bellick's chest.

128
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,540
Bellick and T-Bag will get theirs,
trust me.

129
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,375
Didn't Fox River teach you anything?

130
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,627
Because the same rules apply out here.

131
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,297
It doesn't make a difference
if you're guilty or innocent.

132
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,842
- It's who survives.
- You're not that guy.

133
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,386
That son of a bitch took my girl
and locked her up.

134
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,221
I am that guy now, Michael.

135
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,056
Look at me.

136
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,475
Only reason
I'm not five miles away from here...

137
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,520
...is because I wanna help you
find Maricruz, not kill Bellick.

138
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,065
And if that's your game, I'm gone.

139
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,490
Believe me, I understand
the impulse to pull the trigger.

140
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,827
But if we lose ourselves,
we lose everything.

141
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,668
It's been a week.

142
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,839
- I don't know where she is. I'm scared.
- We'll find her.

143
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,635
We'll find her.

144
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,282
What the hell is this?

145
00:13:55,585 --> 00:14:00,172
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.
The fire alarm has been activated.

146
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,926
Please proceed to the nearest exit
in an orderly manner.

147
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,152
You start acting like a cowboy,
this whole thing's going south real fast.

148
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,154
Remember that.

149
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,465
Here we go.

150
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,308
You're not gonna like
how this ends, Lincoln.

151
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,854
I'm giving you a chance right now.

152
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,566
Just back away, all right?

153
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,320
- Just back away.
- The son of a bitch who killed my dad?

154
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,532
You're done.

155
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,729
Those bullet holes don't heal
too good, do they, Mahone?

156
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,983
Toss me the handcuffs.

157
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,446
Hand them over, or I swear to God
I'll blow your head clean off.

158
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,307
Americans?

159
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,311
Oh, thank God. You know
where the Cathedral of Guadalupe is?

160
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,730
Never heard of it.

161
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,773
Supposed to meet
my old lady half-hour ago.

162
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,651
- That's great.
- They say you can't miss it, but I did.

163
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,571
I was wondering if you had
a travel guide or something on you?

164
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,448
Why don't you just keep on walking?

165
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,159
Excuse me for thinking I could ask
for a little help...

166
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,494
- ...from some fellow Americans.
- Hey, listen, beat it.

167
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,249
How we doing, gentlemen?

168
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,338
All right, Sucre, the gun.

169
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,843
Come on.

170
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,305
Get in the alley.

171
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,278
It is a global problem.

172
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,155
Forty-eight percent
of North American lakes are eutrophic.

173
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,283
- It's 53 percent in Europe--
Kristine.

174
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,285
- Yeah?
- It's your brother, Paul.

175
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,745
What? What's going on?

176
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,667
Hello.

177
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,212
He's in this building right here.
We gotta move.

178
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,839
Let's see your ID.

179
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,804
Feds?

180
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,309
No. If these guys were, they'd be
after T-Bag. You guys Company?

181
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,187
Come on, Sucre.
Let's wrap these numb nuts up.

182
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,779
What are you guys doing here?
What do you want?

183
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,952
I don't like this. Something's up.

184
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,747
Come on, Sucre, let's move it.

185
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,464
Now. Let's go, come on.

186
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
Let's go, Michael.

187
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,034
We know you're in here, Bagwell.

188
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,091
Three to one.

189
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,301
Do the math.

190
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,555
Okay, okay. I don't want any trouble.

191
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,820
Slide the gun over.

192
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,740
We can work something out, boys.

193
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,284
Slide the gun over.

194
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,340
Where's the money?

195
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,596
Who called the cops?

196
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,685
You got three seconds, hillbilly. One...

197
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,687
In there.

198
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,982
Get it.

199
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,360
You want it, you get it.

200
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,946
We don't have time for this, Bellick.

201
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,323
Nothing stupid now.

202
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,618
You're not playing games.

203
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,203
Open it.

204
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,463
Sucre, move your ass.

205
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,555
Michael.

206
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,407
It's a trap.

207
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,767
Freeze, Bagwell.

208
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,609
Get the money.

209
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,402
You want the girl, get the money.

210
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,169
Don't.

211
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,964
Don't.

212
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,633
We can work something out.

213
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,927
Move.

214
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,517
Sucre, come on.

215
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,729
Theodore Bagwell. He's the one
you want for that dead chick in there.

216
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,486
Anybody speak English? I didn't do it.
I swear to God I didn't do it.

217
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,738
Please, please.

218
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:54,534
We can do a little divvying right here.
Then we'll go our separate ways.

219
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,244
Sucre, I want you to get us a car.

220
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,121
What's going on? What's the plan?

221
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,789
I said get us a car.

222
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,712
Looks like you made
some friends lately.

223
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,923
- I don't follow.
- That little setup back there.

224
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,259
It's a little out of your league.

225
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,845
Looked almost professional.

226
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,807
Let's say that's the case.
What's it worth to you to find out, huh?

227
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:21,269
Because I am in possession
of some information...

228
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,271
...that you might need, pretty.

229
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,233
Okay, tell me what you know.
Maybe I'll let you walk.

230
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,860
Without the money.

231
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,822
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

232
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,618
- You're gonna let me traipse out of here.
- Depends on the information.

233
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,621
Who's pulling your strings?

234
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,917
You know, I got a hunch you're
speaking with a forked tongue, pretty.

235
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,419
I'm gonna tell you what.
We go someplace public...

236
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,589
...with a car waiting for me
to leave and then...

237
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,217
Then I'll tell you. Deal?

238
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,970
No.

239
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,329
Oh, my God.

240
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,334
Paul.

241
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,966
That is only the second time...

242
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,468
...a weapon has ever jammed on me.

243
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,681
First time was during training
for Gulf One.

244
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,017
And as soon as it happened, the C.O.,
he got in my face and he said:

245
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,272
"Son, a weapon jam on the battlefield.

246
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,650
You might as well call that suicide."

247
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,417
Uh...

248
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,094
Kristine, I've, uh...

249
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,932
...done things...

250
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,109
- Mm. Damn.
- I love you, Paul.

251
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,861
Whatever it is that got you here.

252
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,240
And there's a way out, believe me.

253
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:47,123
My entire adult life...

254
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,251
...I've followed orders.

255
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,962
And I did terrible things...

256
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,341
...because I thought they were right.

257
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:01,387
And it turns out I did those things
in the service of nothing.

258
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,640
So that's what I'm left with. Nothing.

259
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,311
You have me.

260
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,814
Okay.

261
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,444
And you have a clean slate.

262
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,489
Anything, everything.

263
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,159
- It's available to you starting right now.
- The things I've done, Kristine.

264
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,161
Undo them.

265
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,582
Paul, there's always a way.

266
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,418
Maybe that gun jammed for a reason.

267
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,173
Come here.

268
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,440
Don't let your pride
get in the way now, pretty.

269
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,025
Save it.

270
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,486
Locking me up
ain't gonna help your situation none.

271
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,030
I have information.

272
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,702
- What's the plan?
- We're gonna...

273
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,121
...take him to the embassy.

274
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,081
Gonna make sure he's deported.

275
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,500
Then we'll go looking for Bellick,
all right?

276
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,879
Meanwhile, I want you to ride
in the back with him.

277
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,341
I'm telling you, you are being
penny wise and pound foolish.

278
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,718
Get in the car.

279
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,221
Heh.

280
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:40,862
Pound foolish,
pound foolish, pound foolish.

281
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,949
I'll tell her about the offer.

282
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,495
- Well?
- Twelve years.

283
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,916
No, no, the jury heard
Michael's statement.

284
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,378
They heard a convicted felon lie
for a woman that he clearly cares for.

285
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,589
He's got no credibility.

286
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,467
Sara, we need to take a hard look
at what they're offering.

287
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,928
Due respect, Marty,
we aren't going to prison, I am.

288
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,015
They've made it clear that they want
somebody to hang for this...

289
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:12,393
...and unfortunately, you're the only one
they've got in their grasp.

290
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,769
There's no avoiding it.

291
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,650
This is the plea agreement.
We can walk you through it if you'd like.

292
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,988
Twelve years?

293
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,953
He ain't answering.

294
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,956
I certainly hope your brother
makes it back to that boat.

295
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,919
And if he doesn't?

296
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,962
You should see yourself.

297
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,882
You look like you're hanging in there
by a thread.

298
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,178
I just want this over with.

299
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,014
Then you should never have
come down here.

300
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:56,437
In case you hadn't noticed,
me and my brother don't quit for no one.

301
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,315
Thank God for that.

302
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,276
Because it's guys
accused of things like you were...

303
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,904
...that keep guys like me in business.

304
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:12,453
Kept guys like me in business, rather.

305
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,830
It's gonna end bad for you, man.

306
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,378
A couple of things in this world
I'm good at.

307
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,423
One of them is looking into a man's eye
and knowing when he's beat.

308
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,893
- How far to the embassy?
- Just hang in there, buddy.

309
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,522
- And then what?
- We're gonna turn him in.

310
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,692
- How do we not get busted?
- Before we get there, I'll pull over.

311
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,279
We'll hogtie him with duct tape,
then dump him out and hit the road...

312
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,115
...and I'll call the cops,
tell them where we left him.

313
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,867
- How do we get to Bellick?
- Don't worry, we'll find him.

314
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:56,038
- You ain't getting within a mile of Bellick.
- Nobody asked you.

315
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,916
He's got a point though, Michael.

316
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,793
Just keep the gun on him, okay?

317
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:04,297
I mean, if Bellick's locked up, what
good's the money gonna be to him?

318
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,674
- We'll fix it.
- My girl's life's on the line.

319
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,343
- Sucre, you better pull it together--
- Oh, God.

320
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,509
- Maricruz.
- Shh, shh.

321
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,930
Easy, easy.

322
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,768
- Maricruz, Maricruz.
- You're gonna be all right.

323
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,289
Go get the money, please.

324
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,967
- Pressure. Pressure.
- Go, go.

325
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,049
What exactly is it
that you want, pretty?

326
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,853
I'm turning you in.

327
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,899
Is that it, really?

328
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:14,445
It ain't about the money?
Because if it is, you can tell me.

329
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,530
Ain't nobody here but us cons.

330
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:20,826
You can walk or get dragged...

331
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,536
...but it's up to you.

332
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:28,334
No, see, when you had the gun on me,
I afforded you a certain respect.

333
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:32,838
But, uh, here, well,
the scales are tipped back my way.

334
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,467
So I'm gonna spell out
the present options.

335
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,303
Either we split this money...

336
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,183
...and you go get your legs tattooed,
or whatever the hell it is that you want.

337
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,852
Or they're gonna find your corpse
over that chair...

338
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,440
...with your pants around your ankles
because it's been a long time coming.

339
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,035
Well, I got my answer.

340
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,456
Whenever you're done yakking.

341
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,919
Bring it, bitch.

342
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,406
Who are you fooling?

343
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,076
You ain't gonna kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

344
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:48,038
You ain't got it in you.
So why don't we just let me--

345
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,217
All right.

346
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,521
Okay, Sara.

347
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,691
Now, here's how the plea
is going to go down.

348
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,569
The judge is gonna need you
to allocute to the charges.

349
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,281
He's gonna ask you
if you intentionally left the door open.

350
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,199
- You will say yes.
- Right.

351
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,076
And then he's gonna ask you:

352
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,788
"Did you give support and comfort to
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows...

353
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,833
...since the escape?" You'll say yes.

354
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,711
And then the sentence
will be immediately handed down.

355
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,547
The prosecution is asking
that you do your time...

356
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,008
...in a maximum security facility.

357
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,555
I think the judge
is going to agree to that.

358
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,018
Okay. Um...

359
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,022
With good behavior...

360
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,983
...how many years of my sentence
can I expect to serve?

361
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,861
On a 12-year sentence...

362
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,281
...you'll do nine years.

363
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,328
I'll be out before I'm 40.

364
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,913
I'm sorry, Sara.

365
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,001
Sara, are you ready for this?

366
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,004
What?

367
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,507
A very credible witness
has just come forward...

368
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,050
...and he's willing to testify.

369
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,053
He'll corroborate everything you've
said about this conspiracy.

370
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,596
Who?

371
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:41,795
Linc?

372
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,728
- Uh, do you speak English?
- Si, señor. Yes, I do.

373
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:02,983
Good. I need to, uh, get in contact with
every hospital in the Panama City area.

374
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,402
A friend of mine was, uh...

375
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,696
A friend of mine was in a car accident.

376
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,365
Sir?

377
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,576
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

378
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,495
Linc?

379
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,831
- I'm sorry, Michael.
- What's wrong?

380
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,129
Hello, Michael.

381
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,633
If you touch my brother,
you're a dead man.

382
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,218
Oh, please.

383
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,470
You don't have to worry about that.

384
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,016
But when it comes right down to it...

385
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,436
...he's just like you.

386
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,898
He has a heart that won't kill a man.

387
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:50,197
Give me the handcuffs, or I swear
to God, I'll blow your head clean off.

388
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,848
What do you want, Alex?

389
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:20,018
I'll tell you exactly what I want.
But first things first.

390
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,272
When the authorities
captured Bagwell today...

391
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,442
...the money was nowhere
to be found.

392
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,029
Now, I can only assume...

393
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,615
...that you've got the money...

394
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,328
...aboard the Christina Rose right now.

395
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,832
It's an amazing plan. Take the money,
take the boat and disappear forever.

396
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:48,922
But you are not the only one
that needs to disappear.

397
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,009
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

398
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,679
Good. Because I'm gonna say this
and I'm gonna say this once:

399
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,515
Bring me the money,
bring me the boat.

400
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,977
You are out of your mind.

401
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,520
Not really.

402
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,898
We both have something
the other person needs.

403
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,650
It all comes down to this, Michael:

404
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:12,154
Your brother for your plan.

405
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,533
Five minutes. That's what you have.
