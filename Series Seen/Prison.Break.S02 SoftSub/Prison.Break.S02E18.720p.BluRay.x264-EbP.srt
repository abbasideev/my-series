1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,627
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:04,712
It will work out. You have my word.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,255
Be careful.

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,216
Jane's gonna look after you. Hey.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,178
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 15 years.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,639
- You think she's better off for it?
- Bruce?

7
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,809
We said not to use this number,
but I needed to know you were okay.

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,227
It was you.

9
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,229
What are you talking about, Sara?

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,902
I got three words for you.
We gotta run.

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,989
I wanna turn myself in.
But I got one condition.

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,075
Your wife was released an hour ago.

13
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,578
She'll be here soon.
Just hold up your end of the deal.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,080
I'll get you Scofield.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,833
An NsA analyst
sympathetic to our cause...

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,128
...got his hands on a phone
conversation the president had...

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,589
...with Terrence Steadman two weeks
after you supposedly killed him.

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,427
Twenty-four hours later, Tancredi
is dead, the analyst is missing...

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,222
...and the White House echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,558
There's a tape.
It gives us everything we need.

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,685
Linc will be set free if we find it.

22
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,270
You have something here.

23
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,772
There'll be a lot
who wish you didn't, but you do.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,400
You think it's a conversation?

25
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,444
One they don't want us to hear.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,532
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,233
Yeah.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,323
Patoshik, dead.

30
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,949
Franklin, incarcerated...

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,744
...and assisting with
the capture of Scofield and Burrows.

32
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:03,164
- What exactly is the protocol with that?
- I'll handle that.

33
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,874
We're at the halfway mark, people.

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,961
Burrows, Scofield, Bagwell, Sucre.

35
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,379
They're still out there.

36
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,174
- Now, I heard a report came in from...
- Mexico.

37
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,511
Fernando Sucre was almost
apprehended at the airport in Ixtapa.

38
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,771
Excuse me.

39
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,817
My office, please.

40
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,781
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I came for my damn money.

41
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,201
- Your what?
- The Patoshik reward money.

42
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,372
See, how a reward works is,
someone gets rewarded the money.

43
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,707
And since I'm the one
who bloodhounded Haywire...

44
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,334
...the money is rewarded to me.

45
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,710
You come to my office--?

46
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,713
If you'd returned any of my calls,
I wouldn't have had to.

47
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,383
- We had a deal.
- The deal was you stay under the radar.

48
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,385
Is this under the radar, Brad?

49
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,222
No, this is an office full of federal agents
who now have all seen your face.

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,474
Hey, I don't care what they see.

51
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:09,272
Hell, if you don't pay up,
I'll go out there and drop trou.

52
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,247
Patoshik died, you stupid son of a bitch.

53
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,750
There's paperwork involved.
Of course you're gonna get the money.

54
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,377
But you'll have to be patient.

55
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,591
And if you ever
come in my office again...

56
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,303
...you will not only never see the cash...

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,597
...you'll never see another sunrise.

58
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,442
We gonna keep crying about money
you've already got coming to you...

59
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,612
...or do you wanna make some more?

60
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,114
I'm listening.

61
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,535
Ever been to Mexico?

62
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,499
We give this to the press,
the government will discredit it.

63
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,627
Just like they did
with the tape we made.

64
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,045
Okay.

65
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,298
So, what do we do with it?

66
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,301
There are people in the administration
Dad was working with.

67
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,930
If we give it to them, they'll finally have
the smoking gun they need...

68
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,806
...to bring Caroline Reynolds down.

69
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,935
But they'll release the tape, not us.

70
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,771
And how can she discredit
her own appointees? Sure.

71
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,523
We're gonna give the only thing
that can exonerate me...

72
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,651
...to someone who works
for the government?

73
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,987
The same government that set me up?!

74
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,824
We'll have to find someone
we can trust. Someone honest.

75
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,660
Jane Phillips.

76
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,578
She'll know someone that can help us.

77
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,497
She worked with Dad.
She's watching L.J.

78
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,165
I trust her, Michael.

79
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,501
She'll do it. She'll find someone.

80
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,588
Well, I hope you're right.

81
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,551
Because this is our last shot.

82
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,596
This'll do you right.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,015
It's good from a thousand yards out.

84
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,976
She a clean shot?

85
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,645
Like a good woman,
she does not stray.

86
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,065
Bariment stainless steel fluted barrel,
.308 caliber...

87
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,527
...175 grain, hollow point.

88
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,032
- I'll take the case too.
- She's a throw-in.

89
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,038
The serial numbers have been cleaned.

90
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,624
The chamber's been scraped
to throw off ballistics...

91
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,378
...just in case you're not,
you know, shooting at tin cans.

92
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,882
No, I'm hunting bigger game than that.

93
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,885
Hey! Hey, hey!

94
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,967
Radio silence.

95
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,929
I just don't know how often
he checks this thing, all right?

96
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,850
It seems not that often, considering
you've posted three messages.

97
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,019
I'm starting to wonder
why I need you at all.

98
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,938
To get Scofield. What?
What are we doing here?

99
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,068
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't see
who's sending him the messages.

100
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,946
Well, he's gonna see whatever little
rent-a-fed cops you guys have set up...

101
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,032
...whatever place you set up
to meet him.

102
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,367
You and I both know
how smart this kid is, right?

103
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,745
Smarter than you,
considering you're wearing orange.

104
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,623
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,668
Fish is not gonna peek his white ass
out from any rock that he's hiding...

106
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,087
...unless he sees a--

107
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,963
A familiar-- And that's your face?

108
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,216
Damn straight it is.
Don't pretend you don't need me.

109
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,135
You said you overheard him
telling Sucre about a website...

110
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,596
- Don't pretend you don't need me!
- You overheard--

111
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,557
- He's a Boy scout.
- I don't see how that helps!

112
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,060
If you have a bit of patience,
he will hit me back!

113
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,479
I'm the only one now
helping your family.

114
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,147
- I help my family, okay?
- So do I.

115
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,775
I got Kacee released.
I get Dede medical care.

116
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,779
I'm the one who allows you to visit them.
I'm the one that can take it away.

117
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,490
It looks like we both need each other,
doesn't it?

118
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,119
- Do we?
- So I'll hold up my end of the bargain.

119
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,497
And guess what? You hold up yours.

120
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,500
Now, get off my back.

121
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,964
You can get what you want.
Just give me what I want.

122
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,007
Give me Scofield.

123
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,515
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

124
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,933
Dad?

125
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,811
Yeah, it's me. How you holding up?

126
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,938
Okay. How about you?

127
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,190
Good. Good.

128
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,485
I, uh... I miss you.

129
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah, me too.

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,489
I didn't know you had Jane's number.

131
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,034
Yeah. Well, we exchanged numbers
when you guys split.

132
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,746
- You never called.
- No. Yeah.

133
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,458
I'm sorry. It's been, uh...
It's been dangerous, you know.

134
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,586
- Real dangerous.
- It's okay.

135
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,047
L.J., listen.
I know I've said this before...

136
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,718
...we've found something
that'll finally put this stuff behind us.

137
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,555
When it's good, when it's safe,
I'm gonna come and get you.

138
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,183
- You, me, your uncle, we can--
- Dad.

139
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,768
- Yeah?
- I want you to end this...

140
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,520
...more than anything.

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,316
But I'm in school again.

142
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,985
Under a fake name,
but it's still school, you know?

143
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,904
I mean, it's not the same...

144
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,241
...but it's the closest thing to a home
I've had in a long time.

145
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,412
I guess-- I guess I'm just saying...

146
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,583
...that for now, for a while...

147
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,002
...I just wanna stay in one place.

148
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,005
Have something normal.

149
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,342
Yeah, yeah. I get it.

150
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,928
I, uh...

151
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,722
- I need to speak with Jane.
- Okay.

152
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,227
I love you, Dad.

153
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,063
I love you too, son.

154
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,075
Mr. Webster, sorry to keep you waiting.

155
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,952
Oh, it's no problem, doc.

156
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,537
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate you...

157
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,873
...seeing me on such short notice.

158
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,375
That's what I'm here for.

159
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,794
Good.

160
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,714
Because I got a few things
I need to get off my chest.

161
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,800
See you, Jane.

162
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,478
Cooper Green?

163
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,481
Former deputy attorney general.

164
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,984
Splits his time between D.C.,
Chicago and New York.

165
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,403
Jane says he's been an ally
of Dad's forever.

166
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,488
We find him, we got a shot.

167
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,911
How's L.J.?

168
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,498
He's all right.

169
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,630
Cooper Green's office.

170
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,342
- Mr. Green isn't available at this time.
MICHAEL. Please, this is very important.

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,346
Just tell him I have some information
regarding the sons of Aldo Burrows.

172
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,640
- Aldo Burrows?
- Yes.

173
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,767
He and Mr. Green
used to work together.

174
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,353
Please hold. I'll try to reach him.

175
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,858
She's tracking him down.

176
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,989
- Hello.
- Mr. Green, this is Michael Scofield.

177
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,365
Do you know who I am?

178
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,368
Of course. I knew your father,
and I know what happened to him.

179
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm sorry. He was a good man
trying to do good things.

180
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,789
Well, so are we.

181
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,708
We have something.

182
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,710
- The tape?
- You've heard of it?

183
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,379
Well, I know a lot of people
have been looking for it.

184
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,839
What's on the tape?

185
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,884
If you want to find out,
there's a bronze statue of a mammoth...

186
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,886
...at the southwest corner of Ebert Park.

187
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,387
I need you there in an hour.

188
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,056
- Do you have a blue suit?
- Yes.

189
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,557
Wear it, and a red tie.

190
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,894
That way, we'll know who you are.

191
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,646
Ready?

192
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,982
Yeah.

193
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,155
Good luck.

194
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,461
- This'll work.
- You think?

195
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,420
Hello, Sara.

196
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,006
I figured you'd show up eventually.

197
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,967
You look good, Bruce.

198
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,638
You've done well for yourself
at my father's expense.

199
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,808
I had nothing to do with your father.
He was murdered.

200
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,644
By you, and then you tried
to have me killed. Don't--

201
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,146
How can you say that?

202
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,649
My line was tapped, they heard you
tell me that you were at that payphone.

203
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,820
- I've known your family my entire life.
- Which makes your betrayal disgusting.

204
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,576
For what it's worth,
I've been tortured already. Didn't work.

205
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,411
I shouldn't have to
defend myself to you.

206
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,290
If you can't trust me,
then all I can do is just wish you luck.

207
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,625
Go.

208
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:38,025
Look, before you get started,
I'm gonna save you some time here, jefe.

209
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,694
I played rat for you once,
and that was it.

210
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,613
I got protection now.

211
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,242
I let the top bangers in here cherry-pick
the laundry, clean sheets, new shorts.

212
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,704
And for that, I'm untouchable.

213
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,248
So threaten all you want, homes.

214
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,590
Yo, man, what are you gonna do?

215
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,593
You don't look like
you play too much tennis, Manche.

216
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,846
This is probably more your speed.

217
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,806
Entertainment center.

218
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,893
Wide-screen plasma.

219
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,563
Pinball. Pool table.

220
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,275
- What the hell is this?
- Your future.

221
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,445
At Kankakee Minimum Security
Correctional Center...

222
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,615
...where the only thing softer
than the pillows are the guards.

223
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,826
I didn't come here to threaten.

224
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,286
I mean, why whip the mule...

225
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,206
...when he'll work even harder
for a sugar cube?

226
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,127
The same connections got this fox
out of the river so quick.

227
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,421
Well, I can use them for you too.

228
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,636
All I need to know is where down in
Mexico your cousin Sucre is headed.

229
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,617
Look, mami, look.

230
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,078
I told you. Llamas.

231
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,788
I think those are alpacas.

232
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,291
That's what I said. A pack of llamas.

233
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,294
Fernando! Fernando!

234
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,957
What I'm trying to tell you, doc...

235
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,629
...is I just feel like I've been a penny
on the train tracks my entire life.

236
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,759
And that old Union Pacific
just keeps on coming every day.

237
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:14,014
Back and forth, just running me down,
running me over, but I will not flatten.

238
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,682
I will not flatten.

239
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,518
You know the nice things
about pennies, Mr. Webster?

240
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,354
They have dates on them.

241
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,190
And you can pick the date.
Your own date.

242
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,233
Today's date.

243
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,361
You can get a fresh start.

244
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,947
You can be a brand-new shiny penny.

245
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:37,579
I gotta be honest with you, doc.
I had no intention of, whatsoever...

246
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,165
...talking to you
once I got inside your office today.

247
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,169
But I have to admit, I find therapy...

248
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,174
Well, it's therapeutic. Heh-heh-heh.

249
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,385
I don't follow.

250
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,805
If you didn't plan on talking today,
why did you come in?

251
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,274
Well, I saw that ad
on the back of the bus stop today...

252
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:12,781
...and though it wasn't exactly
like looking in the mirror...

253
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:20,163
...you can't deny that there's a certain
commonality in our visages.

254
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,211
I guess we do look a little bit alike.

255
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,841
But I don't understand.

256
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,725
What--? What the hell you think
you're doing?

257
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,217
- Hello.
- Mr. Green?

258
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,512
- Yes.
- This is Lincoln Burrows.

259
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,473
Do exactly what I say.

260
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,310
Your suit jacket.
Toss it in the trash behind you.

261
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,062
- Excuse me?
- Do it.

262
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:43,747
All right, I just threw my
$2000 Zegna suit jacket in the garbage.

263
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,457
Good.

264
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,085
There's a fountain on the other side
of the park. Be there in four minutes.

265
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,879
Four--?

266
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,902
Make it quick.
The cell is running out of juice.

267
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,821
You were right.

268
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,156
- He's being tailed?
- Yeah.

269
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,700
On it.

270
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,127
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for a guy in a suit.

271
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,505
Lot of guys with suits--

272
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,048
It's me.

273
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,842
See the fountain?

274
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,764
- How could I not?
- Get in.

275
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,963
They wanna drown the mics,
in case we bugged him.

276
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,931
Hey, mister. This is for you.

277
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,726
- I'm not interested.
- I'm not selling it.

278
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:32,480
Some dude gave me 20 bucks to
give it to the first wet guy I see. Here.

279
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,611
See the building across from you?

280
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,779
- Yeah.
- Go inside.

281
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,657
This is getting ridiculous.
I've done everything you asked.

282
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,952
- If you wanna meet me--
- Been burned way too many times.

283
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,413
We need to make sure
this thing goes down right.

284
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,749
Go inside,
and keep the phone to your ear.

285
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,638
- Yeah?
- Where are we?

286
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,641
They've gone inside the Beck Museum.
But we got men out back.

287
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,392
He's not going anywhere.

288
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,149
- Yeah?
- Get to Ebert Park.

289
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,777
I have men on Scofield and Burrows.

290
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,362
Ebert Park?

291
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,864
Scofield set a meet with a target
we're surveilling.

292
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,325
What the hell's Scofield doing
in Chicago?

293
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,495
You're asking why the deer walked
into your cross hairs?

294
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,331
Just take the shot, Mahone.

295
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,874
I'm on it, I'm on it.

296
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,501
And, Alex.

297
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,336
Franklin.

298
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,631
I'm using Franklin
to help me find Scofield.

299
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,633
We don't need him for that anymore.

300
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,261
What I do need is a death
with no questions.

301
00:21:55,982 --> 00:22:00,568
Hey, look, it's nothing yet, man,
but I'm sure he'll hit me real soon, okay?

302
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,912
You know,
if I were in your situation...

303
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,125
...everything you've done,
every decision you've made...

304
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,294
...I'd have done the same thing.

305
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,800
You're a good man, a good father.

306
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,887
There's been a change of plans.

307
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,100
And it looks like I'm not
gonna need your help after all.

308
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,605
So you found Scofield.

309
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,985
My colleagues
are getting pretty close, yeah.

310
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:46,072
- So--
- So I guess you can set me free, then.

311
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,327
Of course not.

312
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,589
- You and me, we had a deal, right?
- Right.

313
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,470
I get your wife released,
take care of your daughter's health...

314
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,638
...and you get me Scofield.

315
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,976
But you're getting him yourself.
You just said that.

316
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,812
I know, I know.
I just want you to know...

317
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,487
...that I'm gonna keep my promise
to you, and I'm gonna help your family.

318
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,074
But I'm gonna need your help too.

319
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,826
And this is something
you're not gonna wanna do.

320
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,995
I don't want you to do this,
but I need you to.

321
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,247
If you don't,
I'll have Kacee arrested again...

322
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,500
...and I'll have
Dede's medical care stopped...

323
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,086
...and I will hate myself,
and it'll make me sick...

324
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,879
...but I swear to God...

325
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,051
I will ruin their lives. Don't make me.

326
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,137
What the hell are you saying to me?

327
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,516
Later, you'll get a package in your cell.

328
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,102
It's gonna be from me.
I need you to use it, okay?

329
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,853
Well, what's in it?

330
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,399
Yo. Yo, what the hell is in it, man?

331
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,194
Just use it or you'll wish you had.

332
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,446
What's in the package?

333
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,907
What the hell is in the package, man?

334
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,326
Yo, what the hell
is in the package, man?

335
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,044
Okay, I'm in the lobby.

336
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,672
Take the stairs to your left.

337
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,427
When you get to the top,
cross the catwalk.

338
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,477
Okay, I'm across.

339
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,438
Go down the hall,
down the stairs to the basement.

340
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,079
Go through the white door.

341
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,331
The one on the left.

342
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,461
Sara, I wish you'd come to me first.

343
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,338
Cooper Green and I go way back.

344
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,049
If anyone can help Michael
and Lincoln, it's him.

345
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,260
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Mr. Green in?

346
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,887
Is he expecting you?

347
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,513
Bruce.

348
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,850
Oh, good, you're back.
I'm here to help you.

349
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,103
- Help me? With what?
- Scofield and Burrows. Where are they?

350
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,565
- This is absurd.
- This tunnel goes underground.

351
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,901
You're already under another building.

352
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,153
See the second door on your right?

353
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,488
Congratulations.

354
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,407
You made it.

355
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,914
I'm sorry, Sara Tancredi.

356
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,875
I trust you've met with Scofield
and Burrows today?

357
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,793
Well, I'm sure I'd remember if I did.

358
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,213
Sara?

359
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,965
If you're Cooper Green,
who's with Michael right now?

360
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,260
Mr. Green?

361
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,055
I'm Michael Scofield.

362
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,850
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

363
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,645
Do you have the tape?

364
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,397
It's right here.

365
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,531
- Yeah?
- Lincoln, it's Sara. Listen to me.

366
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,201
The man Michael's with
is not Cooper Green. You hear me?

367
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,995
The man that Michael's with right now
is not Cooper Green.

368
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,430
We should hurry. We're in Chicago.

369
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,142
Won't be long before the Company
knows you're in town.

370
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,811
Where are we going?

371
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,564
Well, we're gonna make sure
that that tape goes into the right hands.

372
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,108
Whose?

373
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,568
A friend.

374
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,571
What kind of friend?

375
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,949
He's a federal judge.

376
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,285
Is that good enough for you?

377
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,748
Well, this tape is my brother's life
and mine.

378
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:10,461
And consequently, I need a name.

379
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,881
Judge Scott Warren.

380
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,675
A lifetime appointee...

381
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:19,053
...who was put on the bench
by President Mills.

382
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,056
He has no job to lose,
no loyalty to Reynolds.

383
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,310
Wants to see her gone, just like us.

384
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,730
Well, let's go.
I left my car over by the statue.

385
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,982
You were tailed, Mr. Green.

386
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,277
The judge comes to us.

387
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,362
I'll set up the meeting.

388
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,656
Do you see my clothes?

389
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,702
Your brother made certain that anybody
who was tailing me is long gone.

390
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,038
And on top of that, I'm an asthmatic.

391
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:50,126
My inhaler is in my jacket pocket,
which Lincoln made me throw away.

392
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:55,465
I'm okay now, but in about 10 minutes,
I'm gonna have a hard time breathing.

393
00:27:55,632 --> 00:28:01,637
I've got a spare in my glove box, so
could we please just get back to my car?

394
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,398
My car is just a few blocks away.

395
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,485
- Albuterol, Cortizaide or prednizone?
- What?

396
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,780
My mother was an asthmatic.

397
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,408
- What do you use in your inhaler?
- What the hell difference does it make?

398
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,911
Just answer the question, please.

399
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,747
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

400
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,791
How many times
I gotta prove myself to you?

401
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,417
Just one.

402
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,383
Fine. Uh, Cortizaide.

403
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,346
I'm sorry, it's just...

404
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,348
If you knew what--

405
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,350
If you knew what we'd been through.

406
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,477
I understand.

407
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,814
- Can we now just please go to my car?
- Yeah.

408
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,541
A one-way ticket to Bangkok,
s'il vous plaît.

409
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,251
Oh, I'm sorry.

410
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,004
We don't have anything until tomorrow.
Unless you don't mind...

411
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,715
...taking a few connections
through Chicago?

412
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,884
And there's one more
international stop.

413
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,344
Whatever leaves first.

414
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,388
Okay. ID, please.

415
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,561
Okay, Mr. Stammel?

416
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,563
Oh, it's Dr. Stammel.

417
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,441
- And thank you.
- All right. It'll be just a few minutes.

418
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,403
- I'll check this bag for you.
- Oh, no. It's coming with me.

419
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,616
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carryon.

420
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,745
What difference does a few pounds
make on a 3-ton aircraft whether it's--?

421
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,914
It's an FAA violation.

422
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,751
Sir, your bag will be safe.

423
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,809
Today will be a tough
day for travelers in the Windy City...

424
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,771
...as all streets in a six-block radius
of the Grand Carlisle Hotel...

425
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,107
...have been closed to traffic
in anticipation...

426
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,527
...of President Reynolds' speech
there this evening.

427
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,614
This will be one of several
Midwestern stops for the president...

428
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,783
...as she ramps up
her election campaign.

429
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,829
I know you're new, but we use both
sides of legal pads in this office, okay?

430
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,539
Before we recycle, we reduce.

431
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,958
The Comanche used the entire buffalo.

432
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,585
So can we.

433
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,087
Actually,
majority of tribes would farm land...

434
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,216
...till it was stripped of its fertility,
then they'd just move on.

435
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:48,304
The Indian as conservationist is a myth
created by white liberal guilt.

436
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,391
- Paul.
- Hi, Kristine.

437
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,644
I'd hoped maybe I'd see you
at Dad's funeral.

438
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,146
That man died
long before his heart stopped.

439
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,065
That funeral was a formality.

440
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,567
- That's really not fair.
- It's true.

441
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,986
So you wanna know how Mom is?

442
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,615
Someone spitting you out of their crotch
doesn't make them your mother.

443
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,700
That woman is insane.

444
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,869
Do you remember?
Have you suppressed it all?

445
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,081
I know, Paul.
I was there every day, unlike you.

446
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,125
- I was there for 18 years.
- And then you just left.

447
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,169
I was 10, Paul.

448
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,340
You were all I had in the world,
and you just left me there.

449
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,344
I'm sorry.

450
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,848
If I could've taken you with me,
I would've...

451
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,850
...and I've thought about you
every day.

452
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,029
I'm not the brother you remember.

453
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,574
I've changed...

454
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,870
...in a really bad way.

455
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,543
To the point where I don't know
what good or bad is anymore.

456
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:05,214
And I am gonna do something,
I have to do something...

457
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,634
...that a lot of people
are gonna think is horrible.

458
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,221
- Paul.
- And you just remember...

459
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,057
...the brother you grew up with.

460
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,268
Just remember him.

461
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:24,358
You're my sister, Kristine. I love you.

462
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,910
I was out cold.
I don't know where they went.

463
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,623
It was their idea for you to meet them
here in the middle of Chicago?

464
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,958
Yeah.

465
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,922
Oh, man.

466
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,513
Mahone?

467
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,474
You brought me in too late.
They're gone.

468
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,354
- Then find them.
- Let me get this straight.

469
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,607
They come back to a city 15 miles
from the prison they escaped from.

470
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:05,941
Why would they do that?

471
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,612
Because the president's in Chicago
for a speech. They're up to something.

472
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,447
Which is why we need to find them.

473
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,449
And of all people...

474
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,243
...they wanna meet somebody
from the attorney general's office.

475
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,953
Your point?

476
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,499
- Burrows is innocent.
- Wow.

477
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,294
You're good, Alex, as advertised.

478
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,713
No one's truly innocent.

479
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,257
You, of all people, should know that.

480
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,973
It must've been the receptionist.
She's the only one I spoke to.

481
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,573
Michael Scofield, Cooper Green.

482
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,217
We gotta get as much of that in as
possible before the baby gets here.

483
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,094
Why?

484
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,472
Because.

485
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,642
Once the baby's growing in there,
doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

486
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,061
Oh, yeah.

487
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,150
Whoa!

488
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,860
- What?
- I just felt the baby move.

489
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,238
- No, Fernando, that's impossible.
- I know what I just felt.

490
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,242
Well, the doctor did say
that he can become active...

491
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,328
...after certain activities.

492
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,460
- Whoa! Did you feel that?
- Like a flutter?

493
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,337
Flutter, my ass. He's strong.

494
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,923
He's gonna be the captain
of the national soccer team.

495
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,717
You hear that, junior?

496
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,637
Soon as you're born,
I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

497
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,097
No, he's gonna have books.

498
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,183
Fine.

499
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,101
Books about soccer.

500
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,440
Hey, baby.

501
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,235
I told you
everything was gonna work out.

502
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,695
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

503
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,614
The baby's doing great.

504
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,784
Everything's gonna be perfect.

505
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,245
Your attention, please.

506
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,789
It looks like we've got nothing
but smooth skies ahead...

507
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,791
...so we should be arriving
in Mexico...

508
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,378
Excuse me, when is the meal coming?
I'm starved.

509
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,338
As a way to keep ticket prices low...

510
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,049
...we removed in-flight meals
from our service package.

511
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,635
Well, what's left
on the service package?

512
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,721
Pretzels and bags of Krispity Krunch.

513
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,682
Pretzels.

514
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,560
Just a few minutes.

515
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,482
Freshen me up
when you get a chance, darling.

516
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,068
Right away, Dr. Stammel.

517
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,868
Dede's doing real good.

518
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:48,080
Responding to the meds, eating.

519
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,375
She's gonna be okay.

520
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,006
Because of you.

521
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,802
- She's gonna be okay because of you.
- Yeah.

522
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,514
I need to know...

523
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,102
...you know, that you forgive me.

524
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,647
I know that. Of course I forgive you.

525
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:19,028
You know, when Dede was like 4,
she wanted to watch this video.

526
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,405
And I kept telling her,
you know, after the game.

527
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,699
After the game, okay?

528
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,411
She kept asking and kept asking.
I lost my patience and I snapped at her.

529
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,954
I snapped at her real bad.

530
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,666
Well, she went over into the corner...

531
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,212
...and I didn't even go over
and say anything.

532
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,048
Why are you getting yourself upset...

533
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,885
...over something that happened
years ago, baby? Dede loves you.

534
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:48,557
I want you to do something for me.
I want you to tell her that I'm sorry.

535
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,519
I'm so sorry. And that my baby girl
means everything to me.

536
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,231
I want you to tell her that
she means everything to me, okay?

537
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,816
You tell her that every day.

538
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,610
- Time.
- No matter what.

539
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,862
- Ma'am.
- Tell her.

540
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,240
Tell her, okay?
No matter what, he loves her, okay?

541
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,077
- Ma'am.
- Please. Please, you gotta tell her.

542
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,246
- You have to tell her...
- Okay, okay, okay.

543
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,957
Ma'am, you really have to go.

544
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,751
Tell her that her daddy loves her.

545
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,436
Attention, attention.

546
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:39,608
All spectators must remain
behind the barricade at all times.

547
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,407
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

548
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,785
We got a Boom Charlie half a block
south. Team leader wants you there.

549
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,287
- What's the M.O.?
- He's got an I.E.D. strapped to--

550
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,547
He asked you to come
to this fountain specifically?

551
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,173
Yeah.

552
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,554
Let me take a look at that park map.

553
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,059
Why not the fountain
on the east side of the park?

554
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,895
Because this was closer
to the payphone they called me at.

555
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,897
No, because this one's closer to them.

556
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,152
They tell you to meet them
at the statue, then the fountain...

557
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,155
...then they send you
to the building across the park.

558
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,157
Why?

559
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,326
Because they wanna keep you
in their sights.

560
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,787
Because they're watching you.

561
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,250
But from where?
The statue, fountain, building.

562
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,339
There. The hotel.

563
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,677
You know what you have?

564
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,139
- I think we have a pretty good idea.
- What you doing?

565
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,183
Getting unique data
from the memory key...

566
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,560
...so we can identify this key
from any other...

567
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,521
...label it, start a proper record
of the chain of custody...

568
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,690
...to present to the judges I trust.

569
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,358
Cool.

570
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,032
- No.
- What's wrong?

571
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,451
No, it's the date stamp
on the memory key.

572
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,620
It's the copy date.

573
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,790
- I'm sorry, what's that?
- The date the damn thing was copied.

574
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,626
Not the date that the conversation
was originally recorded.

575
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,879
So what? I mean,
you heard what was on the tape.

576
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:28,759
Without a time stamp of exactly
when this conversation took place...

577
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,678
...we can't prove that this
is Terrence Steadman talking...

578
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,014
...after you supposedly killed him.

579
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,892
This could've happened
a year before his funeral.

580
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,519
No, it can't be authenticated...

581
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,397
...so it can't be admitted
to any court as evidence.

582
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,567
People died because of this.
My family died.

583
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,236
I'm sorry.

584
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,241
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

585
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,791
- Hi.
- Alexander Mahone, FBI.

586
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,086
Have either of these men checked in?

587
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,880
- Not that I've seen.
- How about this woman?

588
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,425
Yeah. Um...

589
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,054
Room 1006.

590
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,931
Ten-o-six. Ten-o-six. Thank you.

591
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,854
It's not over. We're this close.

592
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,772
You've already said it's done.

593
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,442
Actually, I said it couldn't help
exonerate you in a court of law.

594
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,155
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

595
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
How?

596
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,783
Well, we all heard the conversation.

597
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,996
There's more to this tape than
potential proof of Lincoln's innocence.

598
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,332
There is proof
of Caroline Reynolds' guilt.

599
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,461
Guilt about something she does not want
anyone to know anything about.

600
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,505
So we blackmail her.

601
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,468
I'm an officer of the court.
I didn't say that.

602
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,554
Blackmail in exchange for what?

603
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,766
A presidential pardon.

604
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:04,354
So the woman that set me up
is gonna set me free.

605
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,108
I think she'll sign it
with her own hand.

606
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,363
Ace Team,
Beta Team, this is Leader One.

607
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,949
All spectators must remain
behind the barricade.

608
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,410
The president will be arriving shortly.

609
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:22,122
The president will reach
Home Base in T-minus 2 minutes.

610
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,521
I love you.
