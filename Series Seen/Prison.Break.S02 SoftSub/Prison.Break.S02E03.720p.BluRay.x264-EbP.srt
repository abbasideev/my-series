1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,127
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,505
Hey, y'all, we're headed out, man.

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,298
Good luck.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,385
- I hope you find the girl, buddy.
- Baby, what the hell's going on?

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,054
Hector says that you could serve
your full sentence.

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,224
- What you doing here? Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me now.

7
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:20,561
What's this about you coming home?
You getting your daughter's hopes up?

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,522
<i>You sitting down?</i>

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,565
Your man is coming home this week.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,526
We can make it
to the courthouse on foot.

11
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,986
You don't understand.
Everything is in that car.

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,864
I've been clean for 18 months now.

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,076
I wanna help people get
from where I've been to where I am.

14
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:42,041
You're right. I should never
have gotten you involved.

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,253
I just need to know
what Michael Scofield...

16
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,755
...wanted from you in exchange
for the green card.

17
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,342
I've been doing this for 15 years,
it's never been about anything...

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,429
...other than you, your family
and most importantly, this country.

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>Now, I need to know</i>
<i>who I'm working for here.</i>

20
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,766
You are working for me.

21
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,561
Are you aware of any arrangement
Officer Bellick had...

22
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,980
...with any inmate
regarding Prison Industries?

23
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,857
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

24
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:10,027
Officer Brad Bellick to be terminated,
effective immediately.

25
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,281
They just announced
the rewards on the TV.

26
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,285
- How much?
- A hundred thousand dollars apiece.

27
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:21,038
The money.
Just outside of Tooele, Utah.

28
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,958
- I got him.
- He's on the wall!

29
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,544
Truck!

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,511
Get men at all area hospitals. Wherever
they are, one's bleeding good.

31
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,055
- We gotta move.
- I can't.

32
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,938
Put in all that work,
break out of prison...

33
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,775
...only to end up dead
at the bottom of a ditch.

34
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,568
Kind of sad, really.

35
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,820
So which one of them was it?

36
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,417
We got a blanket on all the hospitals.

37
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,835
Free clinics?

38
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,838
If they got Band-Aids and Bactine,
we got a body in there.

39
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,717
The brothers come in for a medical,
they're getting it in a van to Fox River.

40
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,344
Anything break on the other six?

41
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:20,473
Eyes and ears on the families.
So far, no hits. Maybe just laying low.

42
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,267
What's the hardest thing
in the world for a con to do?

43
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,685
Nothing?

44
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,021
- Two things in life are certain, Miss...?
- Lang.

45
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,440
Death, taxes and the fact
that a man on the run...

46
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,859
...will make a mistake
in the first 72 hours.

47
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,112
Needing distance, he'll steal a car.
Needing money, he'll rob a store.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,824
Needing help,
he'll trust someone that he shouldn't.

49
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,659
And when he does...

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,496
...he will leave behind the crumbs
that will take us right to him.

51
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,963
- I need your help.
- Michael, what are you doing?

52
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,382
- Cayenne pepper.
- What?

53
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,970
- In your kitchen, do you have any?
- Um, uh...

54
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,263
Yeah, maybe.

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,308
I'm gonna need some rubbing alcohol,
some towels and painkillers.

56
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,394
- Whatever you got.
- And some booze.

57
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,354
Please.

58
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,987
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

59
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,488
Easy.

60
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,494
It's fine, man. Let's just keep moving.

61
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,789
We keep moving
and that leg keeps bleeding.

62
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,251
That leg keeps bleeding
and we're not getting out of Illinois.

63
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,253
This is gonna hurt.

64
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,882
That's good, that's good, that's good.

65
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,760
This will seal the capillaries.

66
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,388
You should not have come here.

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,473
The police have been here
asking questions.

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,933
We didn't have a choice.

69
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,727
I'm thankful for the green card.

70
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,937
- But I just don't wanna get involved--
- I know.

71
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,941
It wasn't part of our deal.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

72
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,194
I'm sorry.
There was nowhere else to go.

73
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,989
When I saw you on the news,
I was worried.

74
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,241
I just hoped you'd crossed
the border by now.

75
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,119
So did I.

76
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,624
Keep giving him these.

77
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,627
- See if you can find some clean clothes.
- Okay.

78
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,421
I gotta go back and get our car.

79
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,507
Forget the car. We can get another.

80
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,593
I don't need a car, I need that car.

81
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,969
Why?

82
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:29,352
Because in that car
is everything we need to disappear.

83
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,852
- What have you got?
- Here we go.

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,647
One of the blues hauled in a vagrant
a couple of hours ago.

85
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,233
It seems the man was in possession
of an item or two...

86
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,652
...that didn't exactly belong to him.

87
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,540
Looks like we got our first mistake.

88
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,004
Hey, you got any of that Oriental jerky?

89
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,006
Excuse me?

90
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,758
Teriyaki flavor.

91
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,052
No.

92
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,512
Well, you got any in the back?

93
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,432
Uh, let me check.

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,769
And get me a bottle of that Early Times
while you're back there, junior.

95
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,687
Feel free to earn
your paycheck today.

96
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,773
Watch the store,
I'll be right back.

97
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,614
How goes it, Roy?

98
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,211
To be honest, Roy, I could've done
without the knee to the junk.

99
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,839
You bit me, Brad.
Like a little girl, you bit me.

100
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,843
- Well, you had it coming.
- Yeah, probably did.

101
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,473
You know, it's crazy, us taking it out
on each other for how things turned out.

102
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,810
You want someone to blame, how about
those convicts staring up at us...

103
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,104
...from the papers every morning?

104
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,484
They took my job,
my pension, my dignity.

105
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,904
When they went over that wall,
they took all of it right along with them.

106
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,490
Everything I worked for my whole life.

107
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,326
You see that reward they got?

108
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,412
Those ass-hats are worth more dead
than you and I are alive.

109
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,415
- Not for long.
- What do you mean?

110
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,418
I mean, somebody's gonna get
that money. Might as well be me.

111
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,006
You know, a job like that...

112
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,009
...might go a little smoother
with an extra pair of hands.

113
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,554
You really think I'm gonna split
that reward with you?

114
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,307
I'm saying, you run into those brothers,
two of them, one of you...

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,977
...you might find yourself wishing
for a good wingman.

116
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,119
Just get it done, Mike.

117
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,081
- How you doing?
- Can I help you?

118
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,709
Yeah, I hope so, Chuck.

119
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,712
I think you may have towed my car.

120
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,464
- What'd it look like?
- What did it look like?

121
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,719
The car you stole the backpack from,
what did it look like?

122
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,722
I don't know, man.
Maybe it was gray.

123
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,766
- It's a gray Accord.
- License number?

124
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,643
Look, man, that's all I know.

125
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,729
I wasn't after the car.

126
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,983
- I thought the bag had clothes in it.
- Remember where the car was parked?

127
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,776
Where'd you park it?

128
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,320
Corner of Hancock and 15th.

129
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,573
I don't know,
maybe around 15th somewhere.

130
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,743
- But it ain't gonna be there anymore.
- What do you mean?

131
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,704
That's the reason
I didn't get to grab anything else.

132
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,582
- Tow truck rolled up.
- Already on it.

133
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,879
Okay, it's gonna be 60 bucks
for the tow...

134
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,756
...and 24 for the overnight.

135
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,605
All right.
I'll be right back with your vehicle.

136
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,982
Shouldn't take but a few minutes.

137
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,994
- Hello.
- Petey, it's Sucre.

138
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,247
<i>As in Fernando Sucre?</i>

139
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,457
- Is there another one?
<i>- Man, I hope not.</i>

140
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,460
But my boy, Sucre, would not be
calling me on the telephone...

141
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,464
...thereby making me an accessory
to his dumb-ass escape, man.

142
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,593
I'm sorry, bro,
I just need you to get ahold of Maricruz.

143
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,972
I can't call her cell because the feds
will be all over the place.

144
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,016
Homes, listen, man,
you have got to forget about that girl.

145
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,144
If I could forget about her, pendejo,
I'd still be at Fox River...

146
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,397
...sitting in cell 40 on your old bunk.

147
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,442
Hope you're holding onto something
because I'm about to break it down.

148
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,321
She's getting married to Hector
on Saturday.

149
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,824
- What day's today?
- Thursday, bro.

150
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,243
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

151
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,039
All right.

152
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,917
- You gotta get her to your place tonight.
<i>- But hang on, man.</i>

153
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,004
I got one last shot
to make her change her mind, dude.

154
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,423
Just find a way to get her there, okay?

155
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,134
Wait, Sucre, hang on, man.

156
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,295
About the broken window--

157
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,214
We got a disclaimer posted on the wall,
says we're not res--

158
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,260
I don't care about the broken window,
Chuck.

159
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,139
I had a backpack inside.

160
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,725
Not when we got it.

161
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,269
Got some paperwork for you to fill out.

162
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,359
You look familiar.

163
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,866
Yeah, you were the attending
when I first started here.

164
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,285
Sure.

165
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,206
Um, would one of you mind
calling me a cab, please?

166
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,541
I don't think so.

167
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,920
Look, Dr. Tancredi, I--

168
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,839
I just wanna say good luck.

169
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,257
- Sara Tancredi?
- I'm sorry.

170
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,301
You have the right to remain silent.

171
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,428
Place your hands behind your back.

172
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,764
If you have any questions,
I'm happy to come down.

173
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,059
Ms. Tancredi, out of respect
for your father, I'm gonna ask you again.

174
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,477
My father?

175
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,563
I'm sure he'd prefer that this went
without incident.

176
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,816
You have the right
to speak to an attorney...

177
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,693
...before you speak to the police.
Anything you say may be used...

178
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,779
...against you in a court of law.

179
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:23,283
You may have an attorney present
during questioning now or in the future.

180
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,412
Carolyn, they're taking her in.

181
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,998
Of course, I'll keep an eye on her.

182
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,462
All you gotta do
is sign here at the bottom.

183
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,133
You'll be one your way.
Excuse me, please.

184
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,596
- Brewster's Towing.
- This is Agent Mahone with the FBI.

185
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,891
- Who am I speaking with?
- Chuck.

186
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,478
I wanna alert you to a possible situation.
Are you listening to me, Chuck?

187
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,440
<i>An individual may be coming there</i>
<i>to inquire about a vehicle.</i>

188
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,484
<i>A gray Accord,</i>
<i>probably with a busted rear window.</i>

189
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,780
Has anyone come by looking for
a vehicle that matches that description?

190
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,912
- Yes, sir.
- When?

191
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,292
Uh...

192
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,752
Chuck, can you tell me
when he was there?

193
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,132
Right now.

194
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,767
Brewster's Towing. Scofield's there.

195
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,186
Chuck, stall him.

196
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,981
All units, Fox River subject 01
Scofield, V-ID'd at Brewster's Towing.

197
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,985
It's my supervisor. He says I gotta get
clearance before I can release the car.

198
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,323
<i>Chuck, you there? Hey, Chuck.</i>

199
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,617
Come on. Come on, Chuck.
You still with me?

200
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:53,081
Yeah, that vehicle might not be here
when you get here.

201
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,083
You need to send somebody now.

202
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,877
Do not let him leave!

203
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,256
Oh, he got the keys.

204
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,264
- Where the hell are those units?
- Still six or seven minutes out, sir.

205
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,939
We got chatter. It's Franklin.

206
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,943
He's at a payphone downtown.
Mistake number two.

207
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,862
I know.

208
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,614
I know. Just let me explain, all right?

209
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,908
Were you ever even in the military?

210
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,454
I served my country
and my country served me up, all right?

211
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,291
Now, look, I wish I could lay this
all out for you right here, right now.

212
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,128
<i>But just know, baby, I am sorry</i>
<i>and I love you.</i>

213
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,799
<i>And when the time comes,</i>
<i>I will explain everything.</i>

214
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,262
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't turn you in right now.

215
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,639
You know what? I'll give you three.

216
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,850
Me, you
and that beautiful little girl of ours.

217
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,062
Baby, look, I got a plan.

218
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,148
I got a plan that is gonna get us
some money...

219
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:05,821
...where you and I and the baby, nobody
can ever find us or bother us again.

220
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,825
You gotta trust me. That's all I need,
the opportunity for you to hear me out.

221
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,827
<i>All right?</i>

222
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,331
All right.

223
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:23,380
All right, listen. Has anybody
tried to contact you about me?

224
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,174
- No.
<i>- Okay.</i>

225
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,927
<i>Okay, that's good, that's good.</i>

226
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,347
<i>Listen.</i>

227
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>In the Rainbow Room--</i>

228
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,685
- Restaurant, New York City.
- Mm-hm.

229
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:42,357
--do you remember that beautiful spot
where we took that picture?

230
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,611
The one by the window?

231
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,697
Mm-hm.

232
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:56,121
I am going to be waiting
in that spot one week from now.

233
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,416
And that's all that I want...

234
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,753
...in this whole world, is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

235
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,548
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Look, I gotta go.

236
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,886
<i>Baby, I just wanna know,</i>
<i>are you going to be there?</i>

237
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,347
<i>I don't know.</i>

238
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,390
But you know me.

239
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,892
- Do I?
- Yes.

240
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,771
Goodbye, Miles.

241
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,863
I'll alert the office in Manhattan.

242
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,282
Send Franklin's picture
to the Rainbow Room.

243
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,868
And go have a chat
with his wife, woman to woman.

244
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,537
Ask her why she never
visited her husband at Fox River.

245
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,998
Pretend you don't know,
the relationship is fragile.

246
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,376
We keep tapping the cracks
and she's gonna break.

247
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,920
Yes, sir. I appreciate the assignment.
I want you to--

248
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,215
Lang, I don't need gratitude.
I need leads, answers, progress.

249
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,051
Anybody that can't deliver that,
just don't even unpack.

250
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,928
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,934
- Mr. Wheeler.
- Stand by.

252
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,062
Stay on Scofield. I want the
license plate number of that Accord...

253
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,147
...and I want you to get it out
on the wire.

254
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,233
- Yeah.
- Now.

255
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,694
I'll call you back.

256
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,826
What's going on?

257
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,414
Apparently, I wasn't the only one
looking for this car.

258
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,291
Great. Let's get out of here.

259
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,050
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

260
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,846
I mean, any more than I already have.

261
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,434
Good luck.

262
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,603
To you too.

263
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,232
So...

264
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,780
I'll see you.

265
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,158
I hope so.

266
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,924
- You all right?
- Yeah.

267
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
Good.

268
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,846
We're heading west,
toward the money, toward L.J.

269
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,515
Just got one more stop to make.

270
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,642
What for?

271
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,520
You trust me?

272
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,481
Of course, I trust you, Brad.

273
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,734
It's just that
if anybody finds out about this, I--

274
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,694
They won't.

275
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,867
Let me handle this.

276
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,792
<i>Humpty Dumpty climbed up a wall</i>

277
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,545
<i>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.</i>

278
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,966
Look, I already told the feds,
I don't know anything, okay?

279
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,386
Those suits with pedicures
and penny loafers? Why would you?

280
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,972
They got rules to follow,
codes of conduct.

281
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,266
They got jobs to protect.

282
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,894
- Now me, on the other hand--
- Come on, boss.

283
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,314
I swear, those guys
didn't let me in on any plans.

284
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,985
Are you telling me that in all
your little powwows in the yard...

285
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,571
...they never once mentioned
what they were gonna do...

286
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,281
...once they went over that wall?

287
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,242
That's right.

288
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,081
You know...

289
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,167
I may not work here anymore, big-uns...

290
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,878
...but I still got influence
with people who do.

291
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:37,175
People who will do whatever
I ask them to, to whoever I ask them to.

292
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,433
And a curvy man like yourself...

293
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,937
Let's just say
there's some filthy individuals...

294
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:54,317
...who might enjoy a cellie
with womanly attributes.

295
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,991
Now, you're gonna tell me
everything you know...

296
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,451
...about where those convicts
are headed...

297
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:08,290
...or I'm gonna throw your fat ass
to the wolves.

298
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,463
Okay, thanks.

299
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,882
Mistake number three.

300
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,595
Someone reported a man matching
Fernando Sucre's description steal a car.

301
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:26,308
- Where?
- Defiance, Ohio.

302
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,686
Someone's going down today.

303
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,654
I know, mami. I know.

304
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,208
Sara.

305
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,670
- I paid your bail.
- You took your time.

306
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,924
- I'm the governor. I do have things that--
- Go to hell, Dad.

307
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,386
You keep this up, this may be
the only place I'll be able to see you.

308
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,847
Do you even wanna hear
my side of things?

309
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,183
Not particularly, Sara, no.

310
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:12,479
Especially when I have no idea
whose side you're on.

311
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,397
But I do know this.

312
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,859
Somebody is gonna go down
because of what happened at Fox River.

313
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,445
And it would be in both
of our best interests...

314
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,197
...if that someone was not you.

315
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,991
But to ensure this,
certain steps need to be taken.

316
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,161
One, you should go
to a daily recovery meeting.

317
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,623
Two, you need to go before a judge
and plead not guilty.

318
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,291
- And three--
- Dad, I don't--

319
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,794
You need to tell the DOC
everything you know...

320
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,046
...about how that prison
was being run.

321
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,383
And that Warden Pope, how he was
granting favors to Scofield...

322
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,094
...because Scofield helped him
with his personal projects.

323
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,554
Thereby exposing him
to certain restricted areas...

324
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,891
...where he may have been able
to obtain a key to the infirmary.

325
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,186
I can't do that.

326
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,523
Oh, yes, you can, Sara.
You can do that and you will.

327
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,651
I did it, Dad.

328
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,280
I left the door open.
Me, and no one else.

329
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,409
That's not true.

330
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,703
- Yes, it is.
- That's not true.

331
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,082
Sara...

332
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,711
...just do what you're told.

333
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:24,092
Otherwise, there will be consequences
that will affect us all.

334
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,762
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

335
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,723
Yes, sir.

336
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,933
Good.

337
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,354
In one week...

338
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,858
...I will be appointed the new
vice president of the United States.

339
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,068
There will be a ceremony,
you will be invited.

340
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,779
You will not attend.

341
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,284
Goodbye, Sara.

342
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,135
- Let's put some music on.
- No.

343
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,138
Forgot. No radio.

344
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,474
Man, it's quiet out here.

345
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,393
Inside, there was always noise,
you know.

346
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:19,147
Someone yelling, guards making rounds.
Kind of got used to it.

347
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,150
You're right. We should go back.

348
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,949
The tats. They weren't just
for getting out, were they?

349
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,580
Breaking out was just the beginning.
Now it gets a little more interesting.

350
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,042
Because me being strapped to the
electric chair wasn't interesting enough.

351
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,504
All I'm saying is, inside,
we had the element of surprise.

352
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,006
No one knew what we were planning.

353
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,844
But there's something about this guy,
the one in the elevator.

354
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,014
It's like--

355
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,726
<i>It's like he knows where we're going,</i>
<i>what we're thinking.</i>

356
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,355
<i>It's a matter of time before he</i>
<i>finds out about the money in Utah...</i>

357
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,982
<i>...Bolshoi Booze,</i>
<i>our way into Mexico.</i>

358
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,194
Everything.

359
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,370
You ready for this?

360
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,540
Make the call.

361
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,338
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

362
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,883
Hey. It's me.

363
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,804
I've got Linc.
We're on our way there.

364
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:38,852
<i>If, for some reason, you can't make it,</i>
<i>call me back at 917-454--</i>

365
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,812
Just got this from surveillance.

366
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,399
You remember that voice mail Scofield
prepaid for when he went off to prison?

367
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,901
- Yeah.
- Someone just left a message on it.

368
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,571
- Who?
- Scofield.

369
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,781
Something about a meeting.

370
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,577
Sounded like he's waiting for someone
to check the message, call him back.

371
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,413
This prefix, it's a cell phone number.
As long as it's on--

372
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,374
We can track exactly where he is.

373
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,733
Don't do anything stupid,
don't do anything stupid.

374
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,640
Is there a problem, officer?

375
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,726
You know why
I pulled you over today, sir?

376
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,686
Speeding?

377
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,856
Let me see your license
and registration, please.

378
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,610
The thing is, I lost my wallet.

379
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,864
Well, I guess your registration
will have to do just fine.

380
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:29,796
So this is your car, Mrs. Miller?

381
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,758
Mrs. Miller's my wife.

382
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,426
I'm Mr. Miller.

383
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:41,015
Well, your tags are expired.

384
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,476
I'll be right back.

385
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,295
Did he sing?

386
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,631
Like a fat, sweaty bird.

387
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,980
Hey, sweet pea.

388
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,691
- Daddy.
- Hey, come on.

389
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,153
Oh, look at you, you're so big.

390
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,741
I want you to do me a favor
and grab a piece of chalk...

391
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,036
...draw Daddy a picture
on the ground, okay?

392
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,625
So how you feeling, huh?

393
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,544
You keeping your appetite up?

394
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,630
Sort of, I guess.

395
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,843
That's good. That's real good.

396
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,264
Oh, God, it's so good
to see you, baby girl.

397
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,685
Do you understand what Daddy
is going through right now?

398
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,731
Sort of. But the kids at school
have been saying stuff.

399
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,983
Okay, what have they been saying?

400
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,779
They're saying you're on TV
because you're a bad man.

401
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,325
And what do you think?

402
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,953
I think if I were some place...

403
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,498
...and they wouldn't let me leave
to see you...

404
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,416
...I wouldn't do what they said either.

405
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,506
You know what?

406
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,092
We are gonna be together real soon.

407
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,510
I promise you.

408
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,345
But Daddy needs you
to do him a favor.

409
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,931
I need you to get a message
to Mommy, okay?

410
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,682
Okay.

411
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,896
Now, I need you to tell her
if she understood what I told her...

412
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,108
...and if she is willing
to trust Daddy...

413
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:01,447
...that she needs to turn
on the porch light at 7:00.

414
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,409
Okay? Can you remember that?

415
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,285
That's a good girl.

416
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,038
Dede, stay away from the gate, honey.

417
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,877
Daddy gotta get going,
okay, sweet pea?

418
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,592
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, baby.

419
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,019
There.

420
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,070
It's not much further now.

421
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,583
They've moved off the interstate,
heading north on Route 38.

422
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,586
Talk to me.

423
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,423
Where?
There's a patrolman who thinks...

424
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,759
...he has Fernando Sucre pulled over
outside of Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

425
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,678
Get in touch with the local dispatch.

426
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,764
Make it clear that we want this man
in custody, not in a body bag.

427
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:13,603
Yeah, dead men can't tell us
where their friends are. You got it.

428
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,404
Yeah.

429
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,813
<i>- Do you have a positive ID?</i>
- It's gotta be. It looks just like him.

430
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,315
<i>- Can you take care of it?</i>
- Yeah.

431
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,816
<i>- Okay.</i>
- I'll take care of it.

432
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,945
<i>- Proceed with caution.</i>
- I will.

433
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,829
Mr. Miller...

434
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,917
...I'm gonna have to ask you to place
your arms outside the vehicle, please.

435
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,172
Mr. Miller, I need to see some hands.

436
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,543
- You ready?
- Yeah.

437
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,379
Now.

438
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,520
This is the one.

439
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,864
- You see him?
- Nope. Maybe he didn't get the message.

440
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,251
They've stopped.

441
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,337
A couple of miles up ahead. There's--

442
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:48,924
There's nothing up there.
What are they waiting on?

443
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,010
Or who?

444
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,559
All right, that's good, that's good,
that's good.

445
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,042
Oh, come on. Come on.

446
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,714
Go red. Now! Go red!

447
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,535
There's one more thing.

448
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,996
You trust me?

449
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,376
Of course.

450
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,753
How do you throw the hunter
off the scent?

451
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,172
Get rid of the prey.

452
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:15,511
Remember, once I hit scan, we'll have
30 seconds before it reaches103.7.

453
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,012
Then she blows.

454
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,349
- That's right. Ready?
- Yeah.

455
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,661
All right, let's go.

456
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,917
Wait.

457
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,004
The music's not changing.
Wait, wait, wait.

458
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,716
Something's wrong.

459
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,634
What happened?

460
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,763
I don't know,
but we're gonna need that explosion.

461
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,604
He's here.

462
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,907
The radio must've jammed.
We're gonna have to set it off manually.

463
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,075
The car could blow any second, Mike.

464
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,536
The feds are gonna be here
in about two minutes.

465
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,539
If it doesn't look like we're dead,
we will be.

466
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,666
Rock, paper, scissors.

467
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,169
- Linc.
- It's my turn.

468
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,103
Better pray for reception.

469
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,282
How many stations
between 102.1 and 103.7?

470
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:05,621
Way out here? Just one, probably.

471
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,229
Whoa.

472
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,538
Where's Maricruz?

473
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,874
- Hey, look, man--
- No, no, no, Petey, you look.

474
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,251
I haven't slept in 72 hours.

475
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,336
I've seen a man's hand
get chopped off...

476
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:59,675
...I've been shot at, dug up a grave,
stolen a car, jumped on a freaking train.

477
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,677
So please, just tell me where she is.

478
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,762
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

479
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,473
I was trying to tell you
but you hung up the phone, man.

480
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,100
The wedding is in Vegas.

481
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,438
- The city?
- Yeah.

482
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:15,691
And they left a few hours ago, bro.

483
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,868
Now, wait. No, no, no.

484
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,120
Come on, man. Hey, Fernando.

485
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,705
It's pristine, man. It's just--

486
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,874
Gonna be back to you in one piece,
I promise.

487
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,168
Can we go back to the part
where I said no?

488
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,712
- I wish I had another choice.
- You do have a choice.

489
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,883
I mean, come on, man.
It's a 1952 Ural motorbike.

490
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:44,720
- Bro, if you so much as scratch it--
- I won't scratch it, I promise.

491
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,351
She's the love of my life, bro.

492
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,061
I gotta do something.

493
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,898
- You look like hell, man.
- Been through hell, papi.

494
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,318
Now, I just gotta get to Vegas.

495
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,077
Um...

496
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,455
Hi, I'm Sara, and I...

497
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,459
Um...

498
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,383
Over the years, I've worked
with more than a few people...

499
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,093
...who had a history of addiction.

500
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,178
And...

501
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:31,517
...I would tell them I could understand
what they were going through...

502
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,644
...because I used to be just like them.

503
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,105
I used to be an addict too.

504
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,358
And I think...

505
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,947
I think that what's becoming clear
to me is that...

506
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,410
...the reason I understood them
is because I am like them.

507
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,911
Um...

508
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,622
I never used to be an addict.

509
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,624
I...

510
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,546
Hi, my name is Sara and I'm an addict.

511
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,339
Hi, Sara.

512
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,346
Hi, my name's Lance and I'm an addict.

513
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,432
Hi, Lance.

514
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,145
I guess a lot of what Sara
just said resonates with me...

515
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,813
...in what I'm going through.

516
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,568
Put in all that work,
break out of prison...

517
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,446
...only to end up dead
at the bottom of a ditch.

518
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,740
Kind of sad, really.

519
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,533
So which one of them was it?

520
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,663
Shales.

521
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,540
Shales?

522
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,876
Scofield. Might be Scofield.

523
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,920
Probably gonna find his brother
in there too.

524
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,924
Oscar Shales is this guy
Mahone tracked for a while.

525
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,344
Nasty little bottom feeder,
you know the type.

526
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,180
He's still in the wind.

527
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,682
Can't get them all, right?

528
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,708
We should have a pretty clear path
to Utah now.

529
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,419
They'll turn their attention
to the other guys...

530
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,089
...which means we'll be off their radar
for a while.

531
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,800
They're gonna get the lab results back
from the accident.

532
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,843
We'll be in Mexico by then.

533
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,845
Provided the transport comes through.

534
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,398
Oh, come on, baby.

535
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,746
<i>In the Rainbow Room...</i>

536
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:03,585
<i>...do you remember that beautiful spot</i>
<i>where we took that picture?</i>

537
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,421
<i>The one by the window?</i>

538
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:13,428
<i>I am gonna be waiting there</i>
<i>in that spot one week from now.</i>

539
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,880
She sleeping okay?

540
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,008
Yeah, like a baby.

541
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,843
Good.

542
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:58,348
So you had some information you
wanted to tell me about your husband?

543
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,653
Looks like I owe you another one.

544
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,156
- It's okay.
- Okay.

545
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,702
Well, once we get to Mexico,
I'll send you 10,000...

546
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,873
...like I promised,
plus another 3 for the car.

547
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,043
Are you meeting up with her?
Your doctor?

548
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,503
Sara?

549
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,383
I don't know.

550
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,887
We should get moving.
Next town's a few miles away.

551
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,349
That's fine.
I can catch a bus from there.

552
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,476
Thanks again, Nika.

553
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,914
I knew the little whore
would take us right to them.
