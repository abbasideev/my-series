1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,752
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,671
- Where is it?
- Go to hell.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,880
You did this to yourself.

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:08,841
Sara, if you're listening...

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,344
...I only hope by now you've found
your safe haven.

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:15,098
I took advantage of you and put you in a
place that's every doctor's nightmare.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,016
Sara Tancredi. You know her well?

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,268
I'd know her better if you
get my ass moved.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,854
- I'll talk to the warden.
- Another Chance, Safe Haven.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,608
Those are the names of some of the
chapters in the book they use in A.A.

11
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,364
Don't make no mistake about it.
We will be a family if it kills us.

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,783
- That's your map?
- Uh-huh.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,828
- What happened to your arm?
- My dad drinks too.

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,873
My tummy hurts.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,001
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

16
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,838
Kacee's going into the system
now. Aiding an escaped con.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,674
- I'll turn myself in.
- Kacee said you need to run.

18
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,635
If you turn yourself in,
Dede won't have either of you.

19
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,513
- Michael, I want this to be over.
- That makes two of us.

20
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,141
It's looking at whatever
your father gave you.

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,392
It's just a key.

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,562
If I may, sir.
The president, she could be useful.

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,021
Madame President?

24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,649
I want you to come home, Paul.

25
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,527
But not with those brothers
running around the country.

26
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,363
- Caroline.
- Please bring them in, Paul.

27
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,575
And everything can go back
to the way it was.

28
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,726
Agent Kellerman.

29
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,770
Paul, where are you?

30
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,563
Out in the cold, remember?

31
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,357
I'm speaking in Chicago tonight.

32
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,787
Yeah, well...

33
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,664
Lincoln.

34
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,458
Sara.

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,836
It's funny how you only call me
when you need me.

36
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:13,257
- Maybe funny's not the right word.
- All of this can go away, Paul.

37
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,842
- Can it?
- Yes.

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,678
I am the president
of the United States.

39
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:22,016
Please just come back to Chicago
and turn Burrows and Scofield in.

40
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:26,687
I promise you that I will make everything
go back to the way it was.

41
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,858
- I have to go.
- Just come back, Paul.

42
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,027
I need you.

43
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,988
You actually think we have a shot?

44
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,534
It depends
on what your father gave you.

45
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,662
This fell out of his pocket
when I found him.

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,122
I don't recognize the insignia, do you?

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,125
No.

48
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,877
But, uh...

49
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,174
Sara, we've got someone working
with us now.

50
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,730
Good morning, sunshine.

51
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,736
How'd you sleep?

52
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,326
I tell you what.

53
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,162
I'll go unlock the kids
and make us all breakfast.

54
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,497
No, I'll get the kids.

55
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,583
- No.
- I insist.

56
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,251
No.

57
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,813
I'll get the kids.

58
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,111
And my hand cream will make them
rope burns feel better.

59
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,071
It won't work.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,616
Of course it will.
Says right here on the bottle:

61
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,036
- "Soothes skin irritations and--"
- No. This.

62
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,372
It won't work. I've got a job.
The kids have school.

63
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,791
We're all gonna get back
to our normal routines...

64
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,086
...once this little
adjustment period is over.

65
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,255
- There's someone coming over today.
- Who?

66
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,758
This woman, Patty,
from the Welcome Wagon Committee.

67
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,344
- Call her and cancel.
- I don't have her number.

68
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,221
And if she shows up
and I don't answer the door...

69
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,849
...she's gonna know
something's wrong.

70
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,648
Teddy.

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,319
Teddy bear.

72
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,863
You need to go.

73
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,826
If she recognizes you...

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,414
I don't want you to get in trouble.

75
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,798
That's nonsense.

76
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,801
It's no trouble.

77
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,182
No trouble at all.

78
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,938
Wakey-wakey, children.

79
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,275
Hi, Sara.

80
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,696
What's done is done.
We all want the same thing.

81
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,534
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

82
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,995
I was scaring her.

83
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,288
I would've pulled her out.

84
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,541
No. No,
you left me in there to drown.

85
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,918
I wonder how long
you can hold your breath.

86
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,171
- Maybe we should find out.
- You need me and you know it.

87
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,966
You need me.
You need me and you know it.

88
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,723
Why? Why do we need him? We have
the key. We'll find out what it's for.

89
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,058
I can tell you what that key's for
right now.

90
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,313
It's to a private cigar club.

91
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,149
Where?

92
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,235
Chicago.

93
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,774
We have to hurry.

94
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,611
We have to hurry, Larry.
I did a bad thing.

95
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,574
I did a very bad thing.

96
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,704
All gas stations.

97
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,582
On 80, 30, 77.

98
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,377
I want Scofield and Burrows' pictures
on each and every gas pump.

99
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,630
If they have no fuel,
they can't get anywhere.

100
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,964
- Sir.
- What?

101
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,551
We might need to divert our attention
away from Scofield and Burrows.

102
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,388
- Why would I do that?
- One of the escapees just killed a civilian.

103
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,390
Patoshik.

104
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,643
A man fitting his description
was spotted...

105
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,978
...running from the scene
of a brutal homicide.

106
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,939
It happened in Algoma, Wisconsin.

107
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,441
It's less than four hours
from the president.

108
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,903
Call the field office in Madison and
have them get some agents out there.

109
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,572
- I'll notify headquarters.
- I didn't say headquarters.

110
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,407
Are you not following direct orders?

111
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,911
Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.

112
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,081
Just not from you anymore.

113
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,335
Everything goes through headquarters
from now on.

114
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,796
May I?

115
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,306
Yeah?

116
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,475
You heard about Patoshik?

117
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,768
Just now.

118
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,937
Good.

119
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,689
- He goes.
- Come on.

120
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,150
The man is mentally ill.
He doesn't know anything.

121
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,361
Patoshik was one of Scofield's
cellmates for a while.

122
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,989
He's included in the escape.
Who knows what he knows.

123
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,659
- Scofield and Burrows are still out.
- Don't worry about Scofield and Burrows.

124
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,703
So.

125
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,454
Again.

126
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,999
Patoshik goes.

127
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,293
Take care of it.

128
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,923
Hi. Are you in charge of seating?

129
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,968
- Yeah. Can I help you?
- Agent Paul Kellerman, Secret Service.

130
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,471
I'm transporting a fugitive to Chicago.
I need you to clear a car for me.

131
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,724
- A fugitive?
- That's right.

132
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,560
It's just, we're already near capacity,
I mean--

133
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,896
You want us to rub elbows
with the passengers?

134
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,647
- No, sir.
- Okay.

135
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,274
What's he wanted for?

136
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,483
Killing people.

137
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,736
- Good Lord.
- Make it happen.

138
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,155
Come on. Follow me.

139
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,793
It's gonna be all right.

140
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,589
If you say so.

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,010
We use him to get what we need...

142
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,179
...then we dump him.

143
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,682
Okay.

144
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,649
I'm sorry you got involved in this.

145
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,319
The fact that you're helping us...

146
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,112
...it means a lot.

147
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,531
Thank you.

148
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,748
The other riders aren't in any danger,
are they?

149
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,376
I mean, should I make an announcement
or anything?

150
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,294
You want pandemonium?

151
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,797
- No, sir.
- Okay, then no announcements, all right?

152
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,883
Keep everybody out of this car
and everything's jake.

153
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,886
I've done this a million times,
never had a problem.

154
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,471
Yeah. Will do.

155
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,150
Let's go.

156
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,283
For all passengers going to Chicago...

157
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,660
...we will be stopping at stations...

158
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,162
We'll be in Chicago in about five hours.

159
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,956
You wanna get some rest?

160
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,851
You okay?

161
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,687
Yeah.

162
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,619
Brad.

163
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,829
You don't look good.

164
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,833
I helped you with Sara Tancredi, and you
were supposed to get me into Ad Seg.

165
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,710
I tried.

166
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,838
But your new warden, ugh...

167
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,300
...straight as an arrow...

168
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,387
...but I might be able
to do you one better than Ad Seg.

169
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,225
You found Scofield and Burrows
through the Russian girl, right?

170
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,644
Yeah, Nika. Why?

171
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:32,232
And you tracked down Bagwell
by following Susan Hollander.

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,818
Yeah. And I blow my nose
with my right hand...

173
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,280
...and I wipe my ass with my left.
What of it?

174
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,499
I've got very powerful people behind me
that want me to finish my job.

175
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,127
They can push the quickest
habeas corpus proceedings...

176
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,088
...the courts have ever seen.

177
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,674
The paperwork's sitting on the
right person's desk as we speak...

178
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:03,263
...setting forth all the constitutional
violations in your prosecution.

179
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,892
It's just waiting to be rubber-stamped.

180
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,354
And what do I have to do?

181
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,690
You just find those cons.

182
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,110
Only this time...

183
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,778
...you're gonna do it for me.

184
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,408
Unofficially, under the radar,
no paper trail.

185
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,372
I need a junkyard dog who's willing
to do the ugly things it takes...

186
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,083
...to bring a con to justice.

187
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,130
Are you my dog, Brad?

188
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,385
Damn hell yeah, I am.

189
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,304
Mmm. Mmm.

190
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,557
This is delicious.

191
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,392
What'd you call it again?

192
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,644
That, my dear Pattycake,
is what my auntie...

193
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,896
...back in 'Bama used
to call hobo chicken...

194
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,316
...one part chicken, two parts spice,
three parts actual hobo.

195
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,153
Oh, come on.

196
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,656
I know, uh...

197
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,911
...fowl isn't part of a traditional
brunch, per se...

198
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,084
...but I have found a lean meat
can act as an aperitif...

199
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,753
...to awaken the palate...

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,507
...for more subtle flavors
and textures...

201
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,135
...such as--

202
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,012
Mommy!

203
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,515
--pumpkin cinnamon bread
with fresh strawberries and cream.

204
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,685
Oh, boy.

205
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,187
Now, how did you two meet?

206
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,982
- Church.
- Mm.

207
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,818
Ahem. After my, uh...

208
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,528
...accident...

209
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,615
...I was volunteering
with some other amputees.

210
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,869
My parish back home
did an exchange program...

211
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,789
...with churches all over this fine country
and, well...

212
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,084
...the good Lord just saw fit to plop
my country rump right down...

213
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,254
...in the pew right beside my Suzie Q.

214
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,341
And you just stole her heart.

215
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,593
I'm a regular one-armed bandit.

216
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,432
Mrs. Wallace.

217
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,809
Teddy just bought me a brand-new bike.

218
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,812
- It's out in the garage. Wanna go see?
- Sure.

219
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,607
We have got company.

220
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,359
Oh, that's okay.

221
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,946
No, it's not. It's rude.
Zack knows better, ain't that right?

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,035
You do know better, Zack.

223
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,047
You gotta have discipline.

224
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:48,595
Without a strong father figure,
a young man might just end up in prison.

225
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,776
Since you are such a fan...

226
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,447
...of Elaine's store-bought blueberry pie,
I'm gonna bake you a real pie.

227
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,036
My name's Lance, and I'm an addict.

228
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,752
Hi. My name is not Lance...

229
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
...and I'm not an addict.

230
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,475
Michael.

231
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,313
Do you know if there's any way
I can get any water?

232
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,899
Yeah, I think there's a bathroom
downstairs. I'll check.

233
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,234
Thanks.

234
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,498
It was never personal, Sara.

235
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,668
- War never is.
- Yeah.

236
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,949
Sara.

237
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,410
Sara, back off.

238
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,080
- Let him go, Sara. Sara!
- Sara.

239
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,212
Settle down.

240
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

241
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,719
You get one of those.
You get one of those. One.

242
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,890
Down. Get down, right now.

243
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,272
What?

244
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,816
These three guys said they saw...

245
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,110
...what looked to be
a fight going on in there.

246
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,445
They didn't, okay?
Just get the train to Chicago.

247
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,240
- Do I need to notify the police?
- Do what I told you to do.

248
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,868
Take the tickets, I'll watch the fugitive,
you can continue to do bong-hits...

249
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,330
...or whatever you do back there, okay?
You guys mind your own business.

250
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,998
Everybody clear?

251
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,000
Great.

252
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,585
Don't interrupt again, please.

253
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,383
Just so we're all clear...

254
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,385
...if she tries that again--

255
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,761
You'll do what?

256
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,763
Just stay on the other side of the car.

257
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,642
It wasn't personal, Paul.

258
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,238
The pleasure was all ours, Pattycake.

259
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,865
Oh, what are these?

260
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,701
Oh, I'm gonna do some renovations.

261
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,205
I was just tapping the sheetrock,
looking for the stud.

262
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,957
Looks like you already found one.
Ha-ha-ha!

263
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,085
- Ooh! Potty-mouth!
- Oh!

264
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,882
Me and the girls get together
every Friday for book club.

265
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,260
You ought to host it this week,
and everybody can meet you.

266
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,512
I'll see you then.

267
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
Can't wait.

268
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,479
This ain't never gonna work here.

269
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,731
Go pack your things.

270
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,191
We're moving.

271
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,594
Now, if you don't stop me...

272
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,974
...I am gonna eat this whole thing
by myself, huh?

273
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,604
All right, sweetie.

274
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,732
Listen, I'll make a deal with you.

275
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,444
Remember that merry-go-round
that we saw today?

276
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:01,449
You're not gonna get a chance to ride it
if you don't eat something. Go ahead.

277
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,869
I don't feel good.

278
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,878
Oh, sweetie.

279
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,551
Okay, come on. Let's go, all right?

280
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,053
I got you.

281
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,726
Okay, just hold on, okay, sweetpea?
Check, please.

282
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,270
All right, nobody move.

283
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,574
- Hey, Sara.
- Not now.

284
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,302
How is she?

285
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,931
Well, she wants to be alone.

286
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,436
So we get what her dad locked away
with that key. What do we do then?

287
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,980
I mean, you saw what they did
with the tape we made.

288
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,607
They're gonna bury everything.

289
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,859
That's why we're keeping him
close to us.

290
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,778
He's got a lot of connections
in Washington.

291
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,029
Mm-hm.

292
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,158
So we get to this cigar club,
open her dad's box.

293
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,078
What if the only thing inside's
a bunch of stogies?

294
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,164
I think it's worth making the trip
to find out.

295
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,265
- Yes?
- Caroline.

296
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,893
Paul, where are you?

297
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,354
I need to know exactly
what you meant...

298
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,564
...when you said
you're gonna make this right.

299
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,859
- I need specifics.
- Where are you? What's that noise?

300
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm on a train.
I'll be in Chicago later today.

301
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,280
But I need to know some specifics.

302
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,950
Where are Burrows and Scofield?
Are they with you?

303
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,619
Don't worry about them,
worry about me.

304
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,999
Paul, there are still positions in my
administration that need to be filled...

305
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,086
...including chief of staff.
I want that to be you.

306
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,215
When I get to Chicago,
we'll meet and we'll talk.

307
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,892
All of it.

308
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,354
Man, I just brought enough to get a
sandwich. I was sitting right there.

309
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,566
If you're lying--

310
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:44,154
Look, my daughter is sick and I don't
wanna spend any more minutes in here.

311
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,407
Trust me, that is all that I have.

312
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,542
What do you got, sweetheart? Huh?

313
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,837
What do you got?

314
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,928
- You don't want to listen?
- Hey. Hey, calm down, man.

315
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,972
- Shut up.
- All right.

316
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,349
Listen to me.
You've got to calm down.

317
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,603
I can help you get everything
that you want.

318
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,272
But you don't want to hurt
anybody else, right?

319
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,899
Come on.

320
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,152
Look, listen. Hey.

321
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,072
Why don't you lock the door
and turn the closed sign back...

322
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,658
...so everybody thinks that this place
is closed, all right?

323
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,369
And then we can get everybody
away from the window.

324
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,663
Is that cool?
Everybody's away from the window.

325
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,041
Let's move everybody on
to this side of the room.

326
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,711
Get on this side. Let's move to this side
of the room, away from the window.

327
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,838
Let's get on this side
of the room, okay?

328
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,674
This side of the room.
Why don't you take my daughter, okay?

329
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,553
Take her on this side of the room so that
everybody, everything is gonna be okay.

330
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,555
Everything is gonna be fine.

331
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,850
Because you're not gonna put your hand
on another person, right?

332
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,645
Right. We're all good.

333
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,481
You all good?

334
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,066
We're good, right?

335
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,656
- Hey, Sara.
- Come on in.

336
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,623
Hey.

337
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,012
I've been sitting here, evaluating.

338
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,599
I, uh...

339
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,729
I jumped bail, I'm on the run...

340
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,984
...and I just tried to take a man's life.

341
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,070
I'm not using.

342
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,742
Which is actually
quite an accomplishment.

343
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,206
But three weeks ago, I was a doctor.

344
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,168
You can get that back.

345
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,170
All of it.

346
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,214
You need to believe that.

347
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,800
You believe that?

348
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,263
You think you can get it all back?

349
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,476
I choose to have faith.

350
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,565
Because without that, I have nothing.

351
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,486
It's the only thing
that's keeping me going.

352
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,824
Well.

353
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,494
I got two things keeping me going.

354
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,998
The first is that I want the people
who took my dad.

355
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,128
And actually the second...

356
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:53,134
...ironically, I probably wouldn't even say
if I hadn't lost it.

357
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,761
But...

358
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,263
...you should know that--

359
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,355
Uh...

360
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:12,237
The first thing they tell you
when you take the job is...

361
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,989
...never to fall in love with an inmate.

362
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,670
What's going on?

363
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,051
Roadblock.

364
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,525
Linc, it's locked.

365
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,393
Hey, you can't be in here.

366
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,030
- Run the roadblock.
- Man, I can't do that.

367
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,490
Run it.

368
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,826
Hey, hold them up!

369
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,695
Bradley Bellick, FBI.

370
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,827
Brad Bellick,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

371
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,371
Brad Bellick, FBI.

372
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,624
Special Agent Brad Bellick, FBI.

373
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,502
Hi, there.
I'm Brad Bellick with the FBI.

374
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,547
I'm an agent with the FBI, Brad Bellick.

375
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:27,181
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

376
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,226
I already talked to the cops.
Told them all I had to say.

377
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,229
Yeah, well, I'm no local hayseed cop.
I'm federal.

378
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,648
And you're not gonna get away
with lying to me.

379
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,818
- I didn't lie to nobody.
- Really?

380
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,946
"He was just some homeless guy.
Hangs around Hancock Square...

381
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,241
...hitting up college kids for change.
He's down there all the time.

382
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,743
If he's not there,
I don't know where to find him."

383
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,745
- That's your statement?
- Pretty much.

384
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,666
You see, the problem is, Charles
"Haywire" Patoshik's a paranoid...

385
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,170
...who suffers from fear of crowds,
who's terrified of strangers.

386
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,172
If he's anywhere,
it's the middle of nowhere...

387
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,756
...keeping to himself, being a weirdo.

388
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,009
- And?
- And if you want to get tough...

389
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,762
...how about I arrest you right now
for hindering a federal investigation?

390
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,139
Who they gonna believe?

391
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,934
An agent with 15 years on the force
and three presidential citations...

392
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:16,230
...or a piece of white trash
with a juvie record?

393
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,566
I didn't ask him to do it.

394
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,445
But in case you haven't noticed, I ain't
exactly broken up over my dad's death.

395
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,989
Why can't you just leave
this Patoshik guy alone?

396
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,616
Where is he?

397
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,786
Or do you want to get locked up
right now?

398
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,795
- Yeah?
- I got a lead on Patoshik.

399
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:40,963
Where?

400
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,382
I'm on my way.

401
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,801
Keep him there.

402
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,303
Alone.

403
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,727
Any information on Scofield and Burrows,
I want to be notified immediately.

404
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,979
If that works out for you.

405
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,611
They're gonna have cops waiting for us
at the next station.

406
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,572
- We need to jump, then.
- And do what?

407
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,115
Hide under a barrel?

408
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,659
Linc's right.

409
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,833
Okay, just put those in there.

410
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,002
So sorry about all this.

411
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,923
It's okay, sweetpea.

412
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,262
Here's everything right here, man.

413
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,768
- It's good.
- All right.

414
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,937
Everyone in the storage room. Now.

415
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,313
What?

416
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,025
Get back there,
until the cops show up.

417
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,361
No, no, no, no.
I can't go back there.

418
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,196
- Come on.
- No.

419
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,366
You kept a cool head this whole time,
don't get yourself killed.

420
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,076
You know what? Listen to me.

421
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,329
I'm a wanted man.

422
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,623
Okay? The police show up here...

423
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,543
...they'll take me back to prison.
You know what? That's fine.

424
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,004
But my little girl right here, she's sick...

425
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,964
...and she's gonna be left alone.

426
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,509
And I can't let that happen.

427
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,054
So can you please let us go?

428
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,734
- Split.
- Okay.

429
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,571
- Go on.
- Come on, sweetie, let's go.

430
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,575
All right, everyone in the back. Move.

431
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,995
- Not you.
- Aah!

432
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,580
You're coming with me.

433
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,665
Go on, move.

434
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,544
Look, I want you to stay right here,
okay?

435
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,506
- Go on.
- Hey.

436
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:54,263
- I think you should let her go, man.
- Take off. Last chance.

437
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,474
You got the money...

438
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,852
...burglary and assault, man.
Hey, that's change, that's little time.

439
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,646
But this right here?

440
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,399
You will be in prison for the rest
of your life. You believe me on that.

441
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,611
Unless you want your daughter
to see you die...

442
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:09,820
...move.

443
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,619
I'm trying to help you, man.

444
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,707
Come here!

445
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,340
Sweetie, stay right there.

446
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,138
Oh, no.

447
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,779
Who did this?

448
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,034
I did.

449
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,088
Thank you.

450
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,685
Haywire.

451
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,729
Don't move.

452
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:29,275
Run, Larry, run. Run, run.

453
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,621
Dino, it's Eric. We got four jumpers.

454
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,333
Three males and a female.
Call it in and get to the next station.

455
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,712
Do you hear me?
Get us to the next station.

456
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,842
The men who pushed the roadblock
are off the train...

457
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,888
...near mile marker 54
just south of the Tedford Bridge.

458
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,890
This is the state police.

459
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,308
Stop. Stop where you are.

460
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,101
- Freeze.
- Don't shoot.

461
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,270
Don't shoot.

462
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,688
Turn around.

463
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,901
I'm an employee of the train company.

464
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,612
Dino, it's Eric. We got four jumpers.

465
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,615
Three males and a female.
Get us to the next station.

466
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,867
Let's go. Come on.

467
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:07,790
They told us to jump and run
and not to look back, or they'd shoot us.

468
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,381
We need to find a car.

469
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,508
Yeah?

470
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,093
I got Haywire trapped.

471
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,428
Don't do anything.

472
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,513
Just hold him till I get there.

473
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,516
No problem.
I got this wing nut treed.

474
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,042
- Caroline.
- Paul, where are you?

475
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,795
- Did you send the police?
- No, of course not.

476
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,716
- How did they know I was on that train?
- Paul, I have no idea.

477
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:44,345
- I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president directly.

478
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,557
Are Burrows and Scofield with you?

479
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,268
I was expecting to brief the president.

480
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,104
You report to me now.

481
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,565
Paul?

482
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,569
Where did we spend my 35th birthday?

483
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,071
What?

484
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,407
The restaurant, where was It?
You remember.

485
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,242
Don't be ridiculous. I have to go.

486
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,328
- Do not hang up.
- I have to go.

487
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,581
- Just get Burrows and Scofield.
- Hey.

488
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,750
Whoever this is...

489
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,087
...tell Bill Kim
that he just screwed up...

490
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,755
...big time.

491
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,343
Paul?

492
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,288
What's all this?

493
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,791
Some wacko climbed to the top
of a grain elevator.

494
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,127
People wanna watch.

495
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,880
You were supposed to keep a handle
on it. Do you know what that means?

496
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,466
I got you Haywire.
What else do you want?

497
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,387
FBI. He's my chargee.

498
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,589
How you doing, Charles?

499
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,341
I don't wanna go back to prison.

500
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,511
I don't blame you.

501
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,014
I wanna go to Holland.

502
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,850
That's not what I expected to hear.

503
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,352
But you can't go there, son.

504
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,105
I just--

505
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,112
I just want to go here.

506
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,448
See?

507
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,579
I'll tell you what.

508
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,917
You don't have to go to prison.

509
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,171
But you can't go to Holland either.

510
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,173
Oh, no, no, no...

511
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,176
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Hey.

512
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,719
You're in a tough spot.

513
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,388
You feel trapped, you got no options...

514
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,725
...and you're caught in a situation
where you have no control.

515
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,977
I know how you feel.

516
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,395
I do.

517
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,067
It takes its toll on you,
and all you want to do is run.

518
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,863
But run where?

519
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,449
I just want to go.

520
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,413
There's a way out.

521
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,418
A way out?

522
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,423
Of this maze?

523
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,468
Yeah.

524
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,435
There are private humidors in the back,
each member's name is on their box.

525
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,731
- Any security?
- A receptionist, that's it.

526
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,608
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

527
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,777
Give me the key. I'll do it.

528
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,158
Want to take a walk?

529
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,826
Yeah.

530
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,163
I know you killed your parents
because they hurt you.

531
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,374
And I know you killed that guy...

532
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,252
...because he was hurting Sasha,
but what you did...

533
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,339
...was wrong, you know that.

534
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,344
I just wanna go.

535
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,849
You can.

536
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,769
I wanna go now.

537
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,868
It's okay.

538
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,142
Sara.

539
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,187
About before.

540
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,190
Me too.

541
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,157
Yeah.
