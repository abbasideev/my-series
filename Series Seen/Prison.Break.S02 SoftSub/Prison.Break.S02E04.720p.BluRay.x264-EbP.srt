1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,169
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,214
Those ass-hats are worth more dead
than you and I are alive.

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,383
Somebody's gonna get that money.
Might be me.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,345
A job like that might go a little smoother
with an extra pair of hands.

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,057
I want divers down in the river.

6
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>- Are you Scott Kolbrenner?</i>
<i>- You must be Debra Jean.</i>

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,520
- It's nice to meet you.
- Same here.

8
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,189
Apparently, Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,984
And if he testifies at that hearing,
a lot of people are going down.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,363
Carolyn, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,240
Hi, my name is Sara and I'm an addict.

12
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:36,119
- Hi, my name is Lance and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Lance.

13
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,581
- You did one hell of a job, doc.
- It's okay for you to leave now.

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,583
Oh, I'm leaving, you're not.

15
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,422
- Where to, sir?
- Utah.

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,923
- Ready?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,682
- So which one of them was it?
- Might be Scofield.

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,934
Probably gonna find
his brother in there too.

19
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,936
Are you meeting up with her?

20
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,063
- Your doctor?
- I don't know.

21
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,443
I knew the little whore
would take us right to them.

22
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,949
What happens when you
get to Mexico? Where will you go?

23
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,953
It's best if you don't know.
It's best for everyone.

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:25,126
We'll drop you off in the next town,
and I'll wire you that 10,000, like I said.

25
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,045
Shouldn't take more than a week or two.

26
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,467
Michael, we got company.

27
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,142
What the hell's he doing?

28
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,606
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Hold on!

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,486
Who is it?

30
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,613
Who is it?

31
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,409
It's Bellick.

32
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,163
Hold on!

33
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,168
Hold on, hold on.

34
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,255
- Duck! Down!
- Hold on, hold on.

35
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,174
Hold on.

36
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,473
Can this thing go any faster?

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,018
What do you think?

38
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,026
Look out!

39
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,986
Hold on!

40
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,559
- Look out! Look out!
- Hold on!

41
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,534
Nobody move!

42
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,078
Nobody move!

43
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,915
Oh, good to see you again, boy.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,751
No need for anyone to get hurt, boss.

45
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,672
Boss? Oh, there's no need
for formalities anymore there, Sink.

46
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,925
I'm no longer an employee of the state,
thanks to you.

47
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,011
I think somebody wants that reward.

48
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,847
Oh, it's not about reward money, friend.

49
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,267
Your pal Manche told me
all about your little treasure hunt...

50
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,561
...for Westmoreland's stash.

51
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,272
Get in the car.

52
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,357
We're going to Utah.

53
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,145
Cops following you all over the country...

54
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,773
...when all they had to do
was tail the tail, you know.

55
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,483
Move that moneymaker, sweetheart.

56
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,276
Let's move it, convict.

57
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,404
If you know about the money in Utah,
why do you need us?

58
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,659
In the excitement of the escape, Manche
didn't hear all Westmoreland said...

59
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,161
...before he kicked the bucket,
but he heard enough.

60
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,665
Utah and five million.
You'll fill in the blanks.

61
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,208
- Aah!
- Hey!

62
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,335
Don't even think about getting cute.

63
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,338
You and your brother are gonna take me
to where that money is...

64
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,674
...or the whore gets dead real fast.

65
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,842
Ask me if I'm bluffing.

66
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,231
The dredging of the river...

67
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,858
...beneath Scofield's
apartment bore some fruit.

68
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,528
Found a hard drive under the riverbed.

69
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,489
Serial numbers match an order
that Scofield put in with Dell...

70
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,658
...a few months
before he was incarcerated.

71
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,203
They've recovered about 12 percent
of the data so far.

72
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,390
And this is helping us how?

73
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,768
Blood tests came back.
B negative all over that crash site.

74
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,980
- Scofield and Burrows are--
- B negative, I know.

75
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,315
- I'll reach out to the media.
- How about don't?

76
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,527
If it gets out that the guy...

77
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,614
...who masterminded this whole thing
is possibly dead...

78
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,325
...the other six cons are gonna get
their guards up more.

79
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,785
It is our policy-- Excuse me.

80
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,999
It is our policy not to announce deaths
until they're confirmed.

81
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,377
We found an exploding car
and a blood match.

82
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,755
- Well, then do more tests.
- On what?

83
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,340
On the bumper. I don't know,
I don't care. Just delay.

84
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,386
I want those guys out there getting
more complacent, not more careful.

85
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,432
The Iranian
<i>government promises to forge ahead...</i>

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,725
<i>...with its nuclear program.</i>

87
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,519
<i>In national news,</i>
<i>the eight escaped convicts...</i>

88
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,690
<i>...from Fox River Penitentiary</i>
<i>in Illinois are still at la--</i>

89
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,067
I was listening to that.

90
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,907
- Yeah, I wanna hear this.
- Really? You like John Denver?

91
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,367
Yeah.

92
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,484
- Don't quit your dayjob.
- What?

93
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,822
No, I just need a little tequila
to get my karaoke on.

94
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,449
Yeah.

95
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,828
Hey, yo, slow down.

96
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,750
- We're doing, like, 65 in a 60--
- Yo, slow down.

97
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,168
All right, Dad.

98
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,679
You know, we can't be having that, man.
Tickets are, like, 200 bones.

99
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,556
Yeah.

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,394
I never thought I'd say this, Scofield...

101
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:02,022
...but I thank God
for the day you walked into Fox River.

102
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,524
And out of it.

103
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,611
It's gonna be okay.

104
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,490
I don't wanna hear from you right now.
You told me nothing would happen.

105
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,450
You promised me.

106
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,875
Oh, that's one pissed off commie
you got on your hands there, Scofield.

107
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,879
Didn't your mama tell you how to treat
a lady, or was she a whore like this one?

108
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,506
- Linc.
- Got a problem there, Burrows?

109
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,718
We only need one of you
to take us to the money.

110
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,136
Remember that.

111
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,306
Let's go, buddy.

112
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,808
Let's go.

113
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,644
I'd been really drunk
at the wedding speech...

114
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,231
...and this was the first time
that we'd spoken since then.

115
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,903
And it was cleansing.
It was really cleansing.

116
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,613
Thank you.

117
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,826
Good share, Ralph.

118
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,121
Well, we're out of time,
unless there are any burning desires...

119
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,373
Actually, I'd like to...

120
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,960
- ...you know, if there's time.
- Of course.

121
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,422
I'm Lance, and I'm an addict.

122
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,091
- Hi, Lance.
- Hi, Lance.

123
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:17,014
My mother died of MS last week.

124
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,852
She just gave out.

125
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,730
Just like my grandfather did,
just like my sister did...

126
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,233
...just like I...

127
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,611
Um, if I may?

128
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,784
- MS isn't usually considered genetic.
- Really? What are you, a doctor?

129
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,747
Uh, I am, actually.

130
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,666
Uh--

131
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,417
Sorry.

132
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,796
Thank you.

133
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,143
All right, everybody, face the wall
and look straight ahead.

134
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,192
Eyes front.

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,696
- How was your flight?
- Bumpy. Everything's ready?

136
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,241
We got a container ship down
at the navy yard. Captain's one of ours.

137
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,077
He's got a stateroom listed
as a cargo hold on the manifest.

138
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,038
You and your family will be on it
when it sets sail tomorrow.

139
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:27,042
Six days from now, John,
you'll be in Sardinia.

140
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,711
Good work.

141
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,427
Sylvia.

142
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,680
Dad.

143
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,682
Yeah.

144
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,685
We missed you.

145
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,729
Yes.

146
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,359
I missed you too.

147
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,535
It's over, it's over.

148
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
Come on.

149
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,131
Come on, come on.

150
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,094
What the hell are you doing?

151
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,100
Mind your own business.

152
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,282
What kind of son of a bitch
doesn't have a spare tire in his car?

153
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,034
The kind that already used it.

154
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,163
Then you're just the sad sack that has
to go back into town and get a new one.

155
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,581
That's like three miles.

156
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,125
That's right.

157
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
All right, everybody out.

158
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,555
That way. Go on.

159
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,813
- Careful.
- Don't touch me.

160
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,274
Just relax.

161
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:59,361
You know, I believed everything you
told me, and I did everything you asked.

162
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,904
I risked my life for you.

163
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,699
For what?
For $10,000 I risked my life?

164
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:08,579
And this entire time
you've had $5 million just waiting there.

165
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,665
You're a bastard, Michael.

166
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,879
For all that aggravation, I hope you get
to hit that a few times, Scofield.

167
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,507
Ba-ba-boom.

168
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,177
We're gonna wait it out in that shack.

169
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,473
Just keep moving. Come on.

170
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,601
Come on, come on.

171
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,855
Fantasia, get going.

172
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,650
I need to talk to you alone.

173
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,280
- What do you want?
- To ruin his life like he's ruined mine.

174
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,416
- And what did you see, sir?
- I was overheating, so I pulled in.

175
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,918
This car was already here.

176
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,213
- What about you?
- Oh, I was reading. I didn't see nothing.

177
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,173
Hey, buddy!

178
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,258
Where you coming from?

179
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,095
Me? I was just hitting the head, boss.

180
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,764
What's your name?

181
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,809
Clyde.

182
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,438
- Clyde May.
- You got any ID, Mr. May?

183
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:21,693
I don't drive anymore,
so I don't really have any ID per se.

184
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:27,950
Camel jockey left a big box of boom-boom
under my jeep back in Kandahar.

185
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,036
- You military?
- Was.

186
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,623
- Which one's your vehicle?
- These two sleds right here.

187
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,126
That is, the in-between rides, anyhow.

188
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,088
Ain't much of a bag
to be hitchhiking with.

189
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,923
I travel light.

190
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,134
You're just hoofing it out here,
middle of nowhere?

191
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,138
I do have the right to see a little bit
of the country I lost my hand for, don't I?

192
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,224
Why don't you tell me
what this is about?

193
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,601
We got a vehicle here without a driver.

194
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,480
And at present, you're the only driver
without a vehicle.

195
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,985
Hell, is that what this is all about?
Why didn't you say so?

196
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,321
Dirty hippie kid
dropping a deuce in the facilities.

197
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,866
He came in with that car
not two minutes ago.

198
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,618
Check it out.

199
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,254
What were you, Army?

200
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,798
Hell, no. Corps.

201
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:29,511
Well, then, semper fi, brother.
What outfit were you?

202
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,764
Hundred and ninety-sixth.

203
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,810
Hundred and ninety-sixth?

204
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,939
Never heard of it. Where they out of?

205
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,482
Hey, sarge.

206
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,153
Hell, man, I didn't do nothing.

207
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,616
Found these in his knapsack
after he said he had no car.

208
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,367
What?

209
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,041
Semper fi, brother.

210
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,544
Semper fi.

211
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,385
Stop stressing. It doesn't do any good.

212
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,890
Maybe you ought to start stressing
if they're gonna put a bullet in our heads.

213
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,435
They need us.
They need us to get that money.

214
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,229
I admire your optimism.

215
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,983
She's rolling, man. I can feel it.

216
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,112
So you wanna ruin Scofield's life?
Well, get in line.

217
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,907
What are you really looking for?

218
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,536
- Same as you. Money.
- Money? You want money?

219
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,456
Ten grand. How's that sound?

220
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,751
We do it right now,
right there on those floorboards.

221
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,920
Not in a thousand years.

222
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,090
Beat it, then.
You got nothing else I need.

223
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,426
Typical man.
I'm talking about millions of dollars...

224
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,262
- ...and you'd piss it away for sex.
- That's right.

225
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,849
And I was hoping you wouldn't
let Michael outsmart you too.

226
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,602
Scofield ain't outsmarting no one.

227
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,522
You think that tire went flat by accident?

228
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,735
- What are you offering?
- I can find out where the money is.

229
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,113
- He trusts me.
- What do you want?

230
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,698
My fair share.

231
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,119
You find out where that money is,
your fair share is $200,000.

232
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,455
- Out of five million? That's not very--
- I got the gun, girl.

233
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,708
You're lucky you're a partner at all.

234
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,296
I'll be right back.

235
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,302
Fibonacci's in DC.

236
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,972
Yeah, and he's in Denver,
Atlanta, Miami.

237
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,725
- I know.
- No, no, no. This time it's for real.

238
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,268
He's testifying again.

239
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,061
He's in Washington right now.

240
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,439
The Globe Hotel, room 116.

241
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,234
- Is this information any good?
- It's from New Jersey.

242
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,154
Fishhead Tommy wants to pay tribute.

243
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,575
Get the car.

244
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,500
Look at this room, John.

245
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,878
Look.

246
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,757
We can be a family again.

247
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,678
But you wanna risk it all, disrespect us.
And for what, for vengeance?

248
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,473
- He betrayed me--
- I don't care.

249
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,682
He betrayed us.

250
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm sorry, you will never
understand what happens...

251
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,110
...when you're in prison.

252
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,322
But you could go back to prison.

253
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,491
I swear to God...

254
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:45,624
...I'd rather die than go back.
There's no going back. Never, ever again.

255
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:50,545
Christ saved you, John.
Don't turn your back on him.

256
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,548
Don't turn your back on us.

257
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,601
I...

258
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,990
I don't know,
about 20 miles from Gunnison.

259
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,243
He's coming. I have to go.

260
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,414
Who was that?

261
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,375
Nobody. It's just my father.

262
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,835
- All right.
- Hey, listen.

263
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,712
Do you mind if we stop
at the next motel?

264
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,174
- It's only, like, 4:00.
- Yeah, but we've been driving forever.

265
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:41,221
- That's cool, I'll drive.
- I really just wanna stop.

266
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,181
- But if we get on the road now--
- Scott.

267
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,102
It's my car,
and I'm tired of being in it, okay?

268
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,896
All right.

269
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,652
Heard about the call coming in.

270
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,031
Can you believe it? Of all the players, it's
the rat that could give us our first collar.

271
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,452
If you guys need to use the can, hold it.

272
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:10,542
You need to tinkle, sweet pea,
I'll watch you anytime. Sit down.

273
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,963
Hands behind your back.

274
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,978
Took your time.

275
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,232
It takes time to gain a man's confidence.

276
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,445
You're right, he'll bite on anything I say.

277
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,658
You just tell me where we trap him, and
I'll tell him that's where the money is.

278
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,805
Hey. You're the guy
from the gas station, right?

279
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,100
I'm the guy
who was having car trouble.

280
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,524
- Seems to be purring along now, huh?
- Yeah. Water pump.

281
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,236
Two hundred bucks for this heap.

282
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,489
They'll get you.

283
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,491
Look, I hope I'm not out of line...

284
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,786
...but I heard you telling the cop
back there about your hand.

285
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,830
My old man was killed in Nam
when I was a kid...

286
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,249
...so I have the utmost respect
for our servicemen.

287
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,043
Just serving my country.

288
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,214
A lot of us are grateful for it.
Listen, if you need a ride or something...

289
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:46,221
Well, to be honest with you,
my dogs are kind of barking.

290
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,181
Well, all right.

291
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,183
Jerry Curtin.

292
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,729
Clyde. Clyde May.

293
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,900
My kid Danny is riding shotgun.
I hope you don't mind sitting in the back.

294
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,070
Hi. I'm Danielle.

295
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,866
Hi, yourself.

296
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,254
- Hey.
- What do you want?

297
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,674
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Again?

298
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,426
I have a small bladder.

299
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,094
That ain't all you got.

300
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,394
Get up.

301
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,446
Well?

302
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,491
They plan to trap you.
The big one, he's got friends in Utah.

303
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,786
Criminals. A town called Panguitch.

304
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,663
They grow drugs on a farm there.

305
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,791
They'll tell you that's where
the money is, but no money.

306
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,420
Just old friends with guns,
waiting for you.

307
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:05,592
Easy enough.
We take a pass on Panguitch.

308
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,974
- Where's the money really?
- I'll find out soon enough.

309
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,144
But 200,000 was old price
for this information.

310
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,649
- I want a new price.
- She's trying to renegotiate.

311
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,987
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be face-down in a marijuana farm.

312
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,573
One third.

313
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:34,162
It's gonna take more than information
if you want a million-six, sweet pea.

314
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,749
- Such as?
- You know.

315
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:42,295
- Piece of that can, anytime I want it.
- Is that it?

316
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,297
Aren't you gonna slap me?

317
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,175
I've slept with men
for a lot less, trust me.

318
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,761
What happened
to "Never in a thousand years"?

319
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,597
That was negotiating.

320
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,603
So...

321
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,856
...deal?

322
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,568
Deal.

323
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,620
We got 150,000 here, John.

324
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,874
With Vittorio's place in Solanos,
we'll be able to live off the interest.

325
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:22,710
Where's your father?

326
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,762
Everything all right, boss?

327
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,891
Yeah. Let's get this over with...

328
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,187
...so I can get back to my family.

329
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,565
She'll get it done.

330
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,567
Nika and I have come too far together.

331
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,570
- When money's on the line, trust no one.
- Sometimes you have to.

332
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,905
Not if you wanna survive, you don't.

333
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,325
You really don't trust anyone, do you?

334
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,537
Can you blame me
after all that's happened?

335
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,749
No, I mean before that. Before prison.

336
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,793
Every time I trusted someone
I got burned.

337
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,172
Every time I got close to someone,
I got screwed.

338
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,635
I know better and so should you.

339
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,387
<i>That's right, the Lotus Motel.</i>

340
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,267
I don't know the number.
I can't talk anymore, I have to go.

341
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,907
Well, check it, I know this might
be a little forward and all, but...

342
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,159
Let me ask you something.

343
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,119
You got a man?

344
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,622
I mean, a boyfriend?

345
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,375
- No, what am I thinking? You're Mormon--
- I'm not Mormon.

346
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,087
You think all girls from Utah
are Mormons?

347
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,342
They are, aren't they?

348
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:58,640
Well, yo.
Hey, then you can party, right? Hey.

349
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,560
When I land, I want 12 armed agents
waiting for me on the ground.

350
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,021
Tell them I wanna go
to the motel from the airstrip.

351
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,439
You got it.

352
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,154
I was an ass before. I apologize.

353
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,323
A little bit.

354
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,992
Sorry. Here you go.

355
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,995
I was a huge ass. I apologize.

356
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,498
I'm not gonna argue with you.

357
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,919
Well, what are the odds
that you're actually a doctor?

358
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,254
Uh...

359
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,465
Fair enough.
They're probably not good, but...

360
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:38,596
And I should not have interrupted you,
and I'm sorry.

361
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,849
- I'm sorry too.
- Well, then, apologies accepted.

362
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,603
I recommend the blueberry pie.

363
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,855
Blueberry pie it is.

364
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,042
- Hey there, Danny.
- Hey.

365
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,214
Sure was nice of your daddy
to buy me a room for the night.

366
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,550
Yeah, he's always helping out
with vets and stuff.

367
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:16,926
Yeah.

368
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,554
Good man.

369
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:24,267
But I was wishing we could've
kept going on toward Utah.

370
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:29,147
Lots of light left in the day,
lots of road to go.

371
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,857
When Dad's back acts up we stop.

372
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,737
<i>"Young Miss"?</i>

373
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,448
That's kind of insulting, isn't it?

374
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,700
Hm?
I mean, you're a grown woman.

375
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:48,166
But adults are always trying
to infantilize girls your age.

376
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,251
Treat you like children.

377
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,963
No duh. My dad
won't let me get earrings, and I'm 14.

378
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,798
You see, that's what I'm saying.

379
00:27:55,966 --> 00:28:00,094
You are more than perfectly capable
of making your own decisions.

380
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,639
- Tell my dad that.
- Yeah, but he don't wanna hear it, right?

381
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:08,561
Because he wants to keep you as a baby.

382
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:16,986
Right? Even though you're more
than old enough to choose...

383
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,489
...how you wanna dress...

384
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,658
...or accessorize.

385
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,078
- What are you doing?
- In need of a friend--

386
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,581
- No, no. I'm telling my dad.
- You know, I'm not good at kid--

387
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,291
Wait!

388
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,841
She's got it all wrong.

389
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,761
Wait outside.

390
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,648
You and I are gonna work this out.

391
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:59,237
Jerry, you really don't want to do this.

392
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:06,911
The thing I like about you
is your determination.

393
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,872
I have a family in Kladno
that have been waiting for me...

394
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,041
...to send for them.

395
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,627
They know what kind of work you're in?

396
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,257
They think I work at Starbucks.

397
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,392
How stupid do you think I am?

398
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,736
My daddy always said,
"Fool me once, shame on you...

399
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,240
...fool me twice,
and I put you in the ground."

400
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,702
Any more games
and I stop the whore's air, understand?

401
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,253
Thanks for the dance, sweet pea.

402
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,759
You bitch.

403
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,429
Fooled you.

404
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,440
I carried it. The cons can change it.

405
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,027
Oh, you really suck, Bellick,
you know that?

406
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,446
Roll him. Let's go.

407
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,702
Hands behind your back.

408
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,583
Thank you.

409
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,419
You're as stupid as the prison doc,
you know that?

410
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,004
- Ignore him.
- He conned her too.

411
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,256
Made her think he loved her.
Look what she got.

412
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,426
An overdose
and a shot at 30 years inside.

413
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,181
What are you talking about?

414
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,059
You haven't been reading
the papers, have you, college boy?

415
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:58,231
Cops found your girlfriend fish-belly
white, gargling her own puke.

416
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,192
- Shut up.
- What do you care?

417
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,819
- As long as she left the door open for you.
- Shut up!

418
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,905
Hit a sore spot, didn't I?

419
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,754
Dad?

420
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,895
It really is, like, the best pie I ever had.

421
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,648
- Do you know what it needs, though?
- Hm?

422
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,857
Some crack.

423
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,070
No, I mean, you know, not a lot.
A pinch.

424
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,863
- A pinch of crack?
- A pinch of crack.

425
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,449
A pinch of crack, a dollop of smack.

426
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,659
Mm.

427
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,537
- That's good pie.
- That's so wrong.

428
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,205
No?

429
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,875
Okay.

430
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,883
- Hello?
- Sara. It's me.

431
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,469
What do you want?

432
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,722
I don't have time to talk.

433
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,517
There's every chance
they're listening to this call right now.

434
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,228
<i>But there's a lot I want to say.</i>

435
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,980
Please don't hang up on me.

436
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,817
- I don't wanna talk to you.
<i>- I heard about--</i>

437
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,696
I heard about what happened.

438
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,243
I want you to know--

439
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:39,206
I want you to know how sorry I am.
For everything.

440
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,918
Sorry's not gonna do me a whole lot of
good with what I'm up against right now.

441
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,420
<i>Listen.</i>

442
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:50,426
Anyone with any ties
to me and my brother is in danger now.

443
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,679
I have no ties to you
and your brother anymore.

444
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,766
There is a way I can protect you.

445
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,102
It's already in your possession.

446
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:06,400
- What are you talking about?
- It was real, Sara, you and me.

447
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,527
It's real.

448
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,034
<i>Michael?</i>

449
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,788
Michael?

450
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,546
How long to the motel?

451
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,548
Approximately 10 minutes, sir.

452
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,592
Let's make it five.

453
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:38,933
Ooh.

454
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,103
Yo, I haven't taken a shower
like that in forever.

455
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,980
Where are you going?

456
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,775
- I was gonna surprise you.
- Surprise me how?

457
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,111
I was gonna get some tequila and limes.

458
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,365
- All right, well, hold up. I'll--
- No, no, no. It'll only take a minute.

459
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,617
Stay here and relax.

460
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,452
You seem kind of nervous.

461
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,831
- I do?
- Yeah, you're sweating.

462
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,166
Well, maybe I am nervous.

463
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,294
Trust me, girl, you got nothing
to worry about, all right?

464
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,841
- I'm one of the good guys.
- You seem like it.

465
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,671
Hang on tight.

466
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,716
- I had the manager unlock the door.
- Got it.

467
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,383
If you're looking for the rat, John...

468
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,095
...Fibonacci's 2000 miles from here.

469
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,267
Who are you?

470
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,562
Local cops or feds?

471
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,024
Feds, John. Only roll out the best
for a man of your stature.

472
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,864
I deserve to know who turned on me.

473
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:04,036
- Tommy?
- The man was facing a RICO rap.

474
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,872
He did not want to go to prison.

475
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,791
I'm sure you can appreciate that...

476
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,460
...knowing what you know
about the place now.

477
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:17,091
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, John, don't.

478
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,849
You are going back to Fox River today,
or the morgue.

479
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,475
That's your call.

480
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,608
I'm coming out.

481
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,069
Weapons come out first, John.

482
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,822
Forgive me.

483
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:47,454
Yeah, I'm coming out.

484
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:54,003
Easy, John. Easy.

485
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,132
- He's got a weapon. Right hand.
- These are serious men here.

486
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:01,594
They have instructions to shoot
at the first sign of aggression.

487
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,346
Please, I'm asking you respectfully.

488
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:09,518
Drop the weapon, kneel,
and put your hands on your head.

489
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,440
I kneel only to God.

490
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,193
I don't see him here.

491
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,076
No!

492
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,230
<i>I think I screwed up.</i>

493
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,109
My dad's an Air Force colonel. Total Nazi.

494
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,612
One of those nightmare,
overprotective dads.

495
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,072
Mm-hm.

496
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,741
- Yeah?
- Well, I called him.

497
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,412
Told him I was traveling with you.

498
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,248
Told him that we were staying
in the same hotel room.

499
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,754
- Girl.
- What?

500
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,340
You gotta learn how to lie.
What were you thinking?

501
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,177
I don't know-- Yeah, for some reason
I don't know how.

502
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:29,473
He was mad enough when I told him
I was staying in a hotel room with a guy.

503
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,225
- That was one thing.
- Yeah, yeah.

504
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,394
When I told him I was staying
in a hotel...

505
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:40,025
...with a guy that I maybe
sort of liked, he lost it.

506
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,281
Wait. Wait, what?

507
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,409
Is that okay?

508
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,175
At least let us take you into town.

509
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:10,764
No. If I'm seen with you
it's a lot of trouble for me.

510
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,808
I can walk. It's only a mile.

511
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,394
We never would've made it
this far without you.

512
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,732
But now you're crossing the border
without me.

513
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,984
You can't go where we're going.

514
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,153
It's not a life for you.

515
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,200
Then that's it, then.

516
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,579
It's over for good.

517
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,330
Thank you.

518
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,501
Be safe.

519
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,509
Good luck.

520
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,019
I loved you, Michael.

521
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,606
And I thought I was gonna get that back,
but you just used me.

522
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,859
- That's not true.
- I deserve more than this.

523
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,821
I deserve more than just being the girl
that you call when you need something.

524
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,365
You think you're gonna
find the money in Utah?

525
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,035
I don't care about the money in Utah.

526
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,538
I don't want any more crime.

527
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:21,627
I turn you in, I get $200,000.
Legal money.

528
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,218
You're the policeman's problem now.

529
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,721
- Nika.
- Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you.

530
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,890
No, you won't.

531
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,421
Good luck to you.

532
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,615
- Hey.
- Hey.

533
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:37,995
Um... HQ called. They're asking
why you didn't intercept Abruzzi...

534
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,955
...when he was walking
towards the motel.

535
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:44,042
The man was a mob boss.
The right move was to get him trapped.

536
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,504
They're saying the way you played it,
there was only one possible outcome.

537
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:52,342
HQ has a problem with how I do it, they
can pick a gun and follow me next time.

538
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,561
Scofield always knew
the rat was the key to Abruzzi.

539
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:05,939
We just put it out on the wire
and Abruzzi bit.

540
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,283
Speaking of Scofield...

541
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,244
...the crash was staged.

542
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,711
Pig blood.

543
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,423
Smart kid.

544
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:41,058
The problem with being that clever,
is that sooner or later...

545
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,518
...you end up getting too clever
for your own good.

546
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,485
Good night.

547
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,804
You have no idea what you're in for.
