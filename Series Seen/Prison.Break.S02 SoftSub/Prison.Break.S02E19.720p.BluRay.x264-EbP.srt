1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,336
Previously on Prison Break:
Let me get this straight.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:07,048
Brothers come to a city that's 15 miles
from the prison they escaped from. Why?

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,551
The president's in Chicago to make
a speech, they're up to something.

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,720
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,972
- So we blackmail her.
- In exchange for what?

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,558
A presidential pardon.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,520
We gonna keep crying
about money you've got coming to you?

8
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,647
- Or do you wanna make some more?
- I'm listening.

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,023
Ever been to Mexico?

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,192
When's the meal coming? I'm starved.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,362
Freshen me up when you get a chance.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,490
Fernando. Fernando.

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,744
- Check this bag for you, sir.
- Oh, no, that's coming with me.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,082
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carryon.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,917
Your bag will be safe.

16
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,546
They're watching you.
But from where? There.

17
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,424
President Reynolds ruined your life,
she ruined my life.

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,842
You wanna take the bitch down?

19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,678
You found your inside man,
but it's gotta be right now.

20
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,180
Have either of these men checked in?

21
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,266
Yeah. Room 1006.

22
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,893
Later you'll get a package in your
cell. It's from me.

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,104
I need you to use it, okay?

24
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
Open on 4.

25
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,426
I need a hand in here.

26
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,144
- I need a medic in B-4.
- Let me die.

27
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,645
No.

28
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,816
- Let me die.
- Save your breath.

29
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,947
A large crowd is gathering...

30
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,492
...along Wabash Avenue
here in downtown Chicago.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,828
They're anticipating the arrival
of President Caroline Reynolds...

32
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,665
...who continues her tour with an
appearance at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

33
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,795
Inner Circle
approaching the south perimeter.

34
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,254
Mark One.

35
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,966
Marker Two.

36
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,678
Marker Three.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,351
Okay.

38
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,148
I think you better go.

39
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,442
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,362
Thank you for your help.
There's nothing more you can do for us.

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,696
Doesn't feel right.

42
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,199
I don't think you want any part of this.
Thank you.

43
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,122
- It's 10 minutes away, right?
- At least.

44
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,045
Listen, this doesn't work,
we're gonna need a way out.

45
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,631
- For good.
- Well, that's on you.

46
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,804
Yeah. What about Derek?

47
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,181
- Derek Sweeney?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,350
- You think he'll be up for this?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,310
All right.

50
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,064
This is your neck of the woods.
You wanna meet at the park?

51
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:14,777
- Uh, how's Third and Racine?
- Third and Racine.

52
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,072
Uh, 3:15, the corner.
I'll be there.

53
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,409
If anything happens...

54
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,328
...I love you both.

55
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,950
Shh.

56
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,493
Key.

57
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,625
Go, go, go.

58
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,177
Sit down.

59
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,382
When were they here?
Five, 10 minutes?

60
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,093
- They were never here.
- They were here. I know.

61
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,595
Where did they go?

62
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,766
- I don't know.
- No, you do know.

63
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,186
He decided it was for the best
and I couldn't take this anymore.

64
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,521
- It's over, just like that, huh?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,567
It's over like you flew to New Mexico on
a dead woman's ID to meet up with him?

66
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,071
Or it's over like when you met up
at the train station in Evansville?

67
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,200
Or maybe like the day today, when you
checked in this hotel here two hours ago.

68
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,619
- Which one?
- I don't care if you believe me or not.

69
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,622
- I'm telling you the truth.
- No call. He's not gonna call you?

70
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,875
Don't lie to me.
You don't wanna do that.

71
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,326
Excuse me, can you tell me
where to find...?

72
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,156
Hey. Hey, hombre.

73
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,700
Hey.

74
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,358
Hey, I need the phone.

75
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,277
Listen to me, man.
It needs to be today.

76
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,405
My family is in trouble, all right?
There's a man out there...

77
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,532
- ...trying to hurt my--
- Your family's fine.

78
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,702
- There's nobody after your family.
- Look at me, man.

79
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,662
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

80
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,416
I know the rules.

81
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,129
I wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't an emergency.

82
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,050
Please, just let me use that phone.

83
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,219
Please.

84
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,229
- Agent Lang.
- Yeah, yeah.

85
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,898
I-- I need to speak to Mahone, please.

86
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,818
- Can I have him return?
- Listen, this is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

87
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,446
And I need to speak to Mahone
right away.

88
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,117
- It's Franklin for Mahone.
- I'll take it.

89
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,415
This is Agent Wheeler.
I don't believe we've met before.

90
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,043
I need to speak to Mahone.

91
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,879
Something I can help you with?

92
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,258
Listen...

93
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,760
...I wanna leave a message for him.

94
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,428
You tell him.

95
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,641
You tell him that I'll do what he wants
me to do, okay?

96
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,103
I just need a little bit more time.
I'll do it.

97
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,272
Just don't hurt them.

98
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,942
You hear me?
Don't hurt them.

99
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,155
What's up?

100
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,158
Excuse me.

101
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,194
- Are you crazy? What are you doing here?
- Keep your voice down. Keep it down.

102
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,078
How you been? You all right?

103
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,372
- It's good to see you, man.
- You too, brother.

104
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,375
If the guys knew you were here,
they might not be cool about it.

105
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,836
I ain't hanging around, man.
I need a favor.

106
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,006
- You owe me.
- I do. You know I do.

107
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,716
Look, it's...

108
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,804
Look, it's just your situation right now.
I mean, I just had a kid, a baby boy...

109
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,183
- ...and I-- I promised Maria--
- I didn't come here to cause trouble.

110
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,560
I'm short on friends.
I need you to hook me up.

111
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,897
You're the only one who can do it
without the green up front.

112
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm serious about this, man.
Here. I need it.

113
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,745
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

114
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,663
- By when?
- ASAP.

115
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,749
- Tomorrow? The next day?
- Now.

116
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,671
Now.

117
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,137
All right, Linc. Come with me.

118
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,297
Stand by. Marker six.

119
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,801
Escort team, stand by.

120
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,056
Okay, stand by for exit.

121
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,941
Seven clear.

122
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,903
Approaching hotel entrance.

123
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,823
Everything looks clear.

124
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,673
- He's over the line. Got him.
- Take him. Take him down.

125
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,134
Get some hands on that guy.
AGENT 2. Hold it still.

126
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,803
- Detain him. Detain him.
- Get him on ground.

127
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,597
Talk to that guy.

128
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,053
Who saw him go down?
Any press?

129
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,597
We got him down pretty quick
but you never know.

130
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,600
- Somebody may have gotten a shot.
- Check around.

131
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,228
Confiscate cameras if you need to.

132
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,897
Put out a statement
before rumors get started.

133
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,816
And get everyone out of here.

134
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:20,984
Now.

135
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,070
We're still waiting
for the response from--

136
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,200
You and I both know that this situation...

137
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,452
...requires us to abandon protocol.

138
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,831
I don't know what you need to tell them,
but I need your men to leave.

139
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,834
Now.

140
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,463
Yes, sir.

141
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,263
Where's your brother?

142
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,223
- I need to see the president.
- Really?

143
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,059
And you think that's a possibility?

144
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,021
- She'll want to hear what I have to say.
- Oh, I highly doubt that.

145
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,322
The only person you get to talk to...

146
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,616
...is me.

147
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,662
And the only way you're gonna live
through the next hour...

148
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,956
...is if you tell me where to find
your brother.

149
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,750
Okay.

150
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,172
- He's in a safe place.
- Be more specific.

151
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,967
Specifically...

152
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,345
...a place you will never find him.

153
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,109
I had the honor...

154
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,946
...to attend Mountbrook
Military Academy...

155
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,828
...whose mission it is...

156
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,290
...to ensure the greatness of this country,
its future leadership...

157
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,208
...encouraging patriotism...

158
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,046
...building a strong moral foundation
and providing the service of men...

159
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,218
...committed to the values of honor,
freedom and country.

160
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,222
But, first and foremost...

161
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,475
...they taught you this.

162
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,037
How do you say "cherries" again?

163
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,705
Cereza.

164
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,042
Looks like you have
to get more cerezas.

165
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,086
Mami, I got you a hundred pistachios.

166
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,507
- With the right amount of salt too.
- Well, it's a combination. I need both.

167
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,259
Why am I sucker for you, huh?

168
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,989
- What? What's she saying?
- That looks like T-Bag.

169
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,741
- What?
- Shh.

170
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,290
He said he was trying to steal luggage
from the airport.

171
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,920
He's got five million dollars.
Why would he--?

172
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,596
Unless he doesn't have it.

173
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,141
Unless he lost it there.

174
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,685
- Stop it, Fernando.
- What?

175
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,938
Do you really believe that that money
is at the airport?

176
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,943
Hey, forget it.
Look at what we have together.

177
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,154
Do you really wanna risk that?

178
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,490
We have everything that we need.

179
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,034
- Except your cerezas.
- Right.

180
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,581
I'll be right back.

181
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,332
Fernando.

182
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,390
Baby. I'll be right back.

183
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,219
You gotta know it's not real hard
for me to recognize a junkie.

184
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,098
I-- I-- I'm saying you don't look so good.

185
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm fine.

186
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,691
You mind me asking what you're taking?

187
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,112
- Here, you want one?
- No, that's okay.

188
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,325
Save it for later.

189
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,789
Varatril.

190
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,294
Benzodiazepine's a
hard-core tranquilizer, man.

191
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,296
Take these every day?

192
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,383
Twenty milligrams.

193
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,179
You must feel like you're walking
underwater.

194
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,849
I do.

195
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,852
It's very quiet down here.

196
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,522
That's why you started, right?
The peace and quiet?

197
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,650
That's not why you do it anymore
though, is it?

198
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,364
Now it's the headaches, right?
And you probably don't sleep.

199
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,369
And you know you're gonna
destroy yourself, right?

200
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,791
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.

201
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,963
Hope we hear from your boyfriend.

202
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,803
There's one difference between
me and Agent Mahone.

203
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,850
He doesn't know the value of a bird in the
hand. He keeps beating around that bush.

204
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,686
But if you don't give up Burrows,
I don't care.

205
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,816
One down, one to go.

206
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,444
I need to talk to Mr. Scofield.

207
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,904
Alone.

208
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,565
Madam President.

209
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,859
Could I...

210
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,071
...have a word?

211
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,617
It wouldn't be prudent for me
to leave you alone with Mr. Scof--

212
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,496
My men are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.

213
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,831
Your rights...

214
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,249
...aren't my first concern.

215
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,461
Do I need to remind you
who you are talking to?

216
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:41,007
Step outside and close the door
behind you.

217
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,702
The things you do for your brother.

218
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,870
It's impressive.

219
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,665
I could say the same for you.

220
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,585
- But I won't.
- Bear in mind...

221
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,672
...your opinion means little to me.

222
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,008
This tape.

223
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,719
You have it with you?

224
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,804
No.

225
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,891
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

226
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,939
You don't make arrangements for me,
Mr. Scofield.

227
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,525
I have people for that.

228
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,113
I'm not exactly sure
what is on this tape...

229
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,116
...but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

230
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,453
It's a recorded conversation
between you and your brother.

231
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,249
Well, out of millions of conversations that
I had with my brother during his lifetime--

232
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,376
I'll narrow it down for you.

233
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,964
It was recorded sometime
after his death.

234
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,092
And this...

235
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,679
...particular conversation...

236
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,225
...you might wanna keep in the family.

237
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,147
And where is it?

238
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,859
Twenty different copies
in 20 different locations.

239
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,737
I can call my brother right now.

240
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,614
He can play it for you.

241
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,909
Not on the phone.
Have him bring it here.

242
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,912
These are the terms.

243
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,999
You can hear it over the phone...

244
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,086
...or you can hear it on the news.

245
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,172
It's up to you.

246
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,428
You know, it's why I started.

247
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,680
Started what?

248
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,391
Using. Same reason as you.

249
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,394
Why? Because you had to stay up
all night during residency?

250
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,399
Because the bass player dumped you
in front of the whole sorority?

251
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,652
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

252
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,488
I've seen people die too.

253
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,242
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

254
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,702
You need help.

255
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,455
Not what I'm looking for.

256
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,630
For your sake, I hope your boyfriend
calls back real soon.

257
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,786
Maricruz?

258
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,959
Where the hell's everybody?

259
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,089
Mami?

260
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,637
Hey, lookie here. Good old Sucre.

261
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,764
What'd you do?
Where are they? Maricruz.

262
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,601
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep your cap on.

263
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,769
Out picking apples
for the Snuffaluffagus.

264
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,605
- If you ever--
- Calm down.

265
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,399
They're gonna walk back in here
any minute.

266
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,484
Which means trouble.

267
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:34,282
Unless you wanna see me try out the new
T-20-Z on your bella muchacha Mari-poon.

268
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,119
I think you better come with me.

269
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,835
Yeah?

270
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,421
Lincoln Burrows?

271
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,423
Caroline Reynolds.

272
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:55,220
I understand you have
something for me.

273
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,143
- You still there?
- Oh, I'm here.

274
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,021
It's good to finally talk to you.

275
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,817
Wish I had the chance one of those
242 nights I spent on death row, you--

276
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,987
Please, just play the tape.

277
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,666
It's awful, I know.

278
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,170
But the choice was clear. You needed
to be far away from all of this.

279
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,840
I am.
I'm the lsle of Terrence, far off to sea.

280
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,551
But I'm still here for you.

281
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,888
Now, listen to me.
Don't dwell on the negative.

282
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,140
Some people
deserve to dwell, Caroline.

283
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,269
You know I'm only a phone call away.

284
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,147
Mm-hm. And three thousand miles.

285
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,237
Do you know how cold it is here?

286
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,656
We talked about this, Terrence.

287
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,909
You knew that you would be lonely,
but it's only temporary.

288
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,453
His appeals process has started already.

289
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,581
This is gonna fly by quicker
than your 20s.

290
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:09,335
And soon the world will forget
all about him...

291
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,463
...and they'll forget about you too.
I promise.

292
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,090
But...

293
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,012
...it's killing me not being able
to see you...

294
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,098
- ...sweet Caroline.
- I wanna see you too.

295
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,019
- But that can't happen right now.
- This house is so big.

296
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,730
I just-- I just think of you...

297
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,733
...lying in bed.

298
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,403
- I know. Me too.
- Your warmth, your touch.

299
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,289
Was it quick...

300
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,876
...when he killed himself?

301
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,421
Well, it was a lot quicker
than how my father died.

302
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,548
They shot him in the back.

303
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,718
He died in my arms.

304
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,763
I just wanna know what happened.

305
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,351
Your brother apologized.

306
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:12,148
He said he was sorry and then he blew
his brains out all over the wall.

307
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,152
It was quick...

308
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,237
...and it was his decision.

309
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,574
And now it's time
for you to make yours.

310
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:33,002
No, no, no, no. Man, you know,
I-- I can't-- I can't do it. I can't do that.

311
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,505
Yes, you can.

312
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,424
There's nothing to be afraid of.

313
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,343
You don't get it, do you?

314
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,429
You can't stop this guy.

315
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,350
Not without your cooperation, I can't.
But if you talk to me...

316
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,437
...if you tell me what's going on,
I can take care of you, okay?

317
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,689
You've gotta trust me, Mr. Franklin.

318
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,275
I can help you.

319
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,113
C-Note, right?

320
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,199
Yeah, whatever.

321
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,708
All I need you to do is tell me exactly
what Agent Mahone told you.

322
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,172
If you give me Mahone,
I'll give you your life back.

323
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,592
God's been smiling
down on me, I can tell you that.

324
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,719
First I caught up to Haywire
up in Algoma.

325
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,722
He did a dive off an elevator
before they could put him away...

326
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,475
- ...but I still get the reward.
- Wait, wait. He's dead?

327
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,979
Yep. Like a gnat on a Peterbilt. Hope you
don't take the same route, Sucre.

328
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,774
- Hell, no. I got plenty reasons to live.
- I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

329
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,194
Or maybe if you play nice, I'll throw
your Maricruz a couple of bills.

330
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,822
- After I turn you in.
- How much are you getting for us?

331
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,742
A hundred grand. I bet you never thought
your ass would be worth all that.

332
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,744
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,874
What if I know where you can
get 5 million dollars?

334
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,045
You heard me.

335
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:02,216
- Where is it?
- I could take you there...

336
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,137
...if you didn't have to take me back
to the States and turn me back in.

337
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,639
Where is it?

338
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,269
T-Bag's in town.

339
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,356
I made my commitment a long time ago.

340
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,319
I agreed to put my country
ahead of myself...

341
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,863
...like a mother does for a child.

342
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,284
And I thought...

343
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:32,955
...that what I was doing was noble
and that I would be rewarded.

344
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,290
You were wrong.

345
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:38,628
Don't you see
that I'm a pawn in this too?

346
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,131
The power that has taken over
this country...

347
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,052
...is like a cancer
and it will stop at nothing.

348
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:50,139
- It is out of my control.
- So is this.

349
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,226
Tell me what you want from me.

350
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,103
Uncuff me.

351
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,648
- I don't have the keys.
- You'll get them.

352
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,984
Second, I want you to arrange for me
to walk away from here alone.

353
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,819
No surveillance.

354
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,489
Okay.

355
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,283
And finally...

356
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:14,830
...I want a presidential pardon for me
and my brother...

357
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,167
...fully exonerating us
of all our crimes.

358
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,419
And I want it today.

359
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,849
I can't just hand out
pardons to anyone I choose.

360
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,728
- There is a process, rules.
- This is no exception.

361
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,357
A document will be delivered for
your approval just like any pardon.

362
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,234
You'll sign it and then file it...

363
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,487
...with the attorney general,
who'll submit it to Presidential Record.

364
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,907
Fine. I will sign whatever
you need me to sign.

365
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,743
That's very kind.
But we both know that's not enough.

366
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,037
What do you want from me?

367
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,374
I will unlock you myself,
walk you out of here.

368
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,960
What, you want me to drive you
to the airport?

369
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,380
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be.
Especially with paperwork.

370
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,507
It's so easy to lose.

371
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,468
Now, I want you to go out there
in front of everyone...

372
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,972
...and announce our full pardon
on live TV.

373
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,142
You're insane.

374
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,644
That is not the way things are done.

375
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,314
This is not a vacuum.
People will ask questions.

376
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,900
Pardon. On stage. Now.

377
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:34,410
And how do I know that you won't
release the tape an hour later?

378
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,246
You don't.

379
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,082
You'll just have to take my word for it.

380
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:45,296
- Well, I need more than that.
- Well, you're not gonna get it.

381
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,093
Caroline...

382
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,846
...it's time.

383
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,474
Make your choice.

384
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:08,444
Adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee
and bring him here to be released.

385
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,739
What are you doing?

386
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:16,118
I am going to make an announcement
pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother...

387
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:19,038
...and he will walk away unharmed.

388
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,289
Are you out of your mind?

389
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,877
He has brought some indisputable
evidence to light.

390
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,297
We could end this all, right now.

391
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,799
You're gonna let them walk?

392
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:34,303
I am the commander in chief,
and you are a corporate lackey.

393
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,807
I am making the calls now.
You have no authority.

394
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,977
My men will see to it...

395
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,690
...that Mr. Scofield walks away
without the interference...

396
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,984
...of you and your pit bulls.

397
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,187
- You alone?
- Yeah.

398
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,192
- How'd you do?
- Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

399
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,819
Nice.

400
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,030
- I owe you.
- No. We're even.

401
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,824
- These are for you.
- Nice.

402
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,701
And this.

403
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,123
- What's this?
- Eddie. When you broke out...

404
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,709
...he bet me a hundred bucks
you'd be caught in a week.

405
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,919
I said, no way. Not the Linc I know.

406
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,172
Figured I'd split it with you.

407
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,884
So this is it, huh?

408
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,927
Yeah.

409
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,680
Good luck.

410
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,351
- You take care. All right.
- You too.

411
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,604
You be safe.

412
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,422
- This is your neck of the woods.
- Yeah. How's Third and Racine?

413
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,299
I'll be there.

414
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,100
I don't wanna do this. I really don't.

415
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,978
What are you talking about?

416
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,314
You can't say that I didn't give
you a choice...

417
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,399
...you never
take the easy way. You--

418
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,277
And I noticed that about you. You--

419
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:59,240
I should never expect it to be any
different but I have a job to do...

420
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,200
...a job that I'm being made to do.

421
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,163
Pick it up, Sara.

422
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,874
Sara, pick it up.

423
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,628
- Pick up.
- Wait, wait.

424
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,215
Don't move.

425
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,635
Just don't-- Don't move.

426
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,930
Okay, I need the phone.
Give me the phone.

427
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,392
Stay right where you are, please.

428
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,895
You don't really wanna do this.

429
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,398
You don't know the first thing about
what I want.

430
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,668
- You got my message?
- Yeah.

431
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,923
- I got her.
- She's on her way out.

432
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,969
Follow her. She'll take you
right to Scofield.

433
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,033
Sir...

434
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,535
...we need to talk.

435
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,498
In just a few minutes, the president...

436
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,377
...is going to announce a pardon
for Burrows and Scofield.

437
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,130
As you're well aware,
this is quite a departure.

438
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:42,718
She's always been willing to play ball
but I think we need to take some action.

439
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,638
Sir...

440
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,351
...I hate to disturb you...

441
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:55,814
...but I'm not sure you realize the gravity
of what she's about to do.

442
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,336
- Michael.
- Sara.

443
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,547
- It worked.
- The pardon?

444
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,759
She's announcing it any minute.

445
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,096
Oh, my God.

446
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,765
Oh, my God. Michael, that's amazing.

447
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,850
Just get here, okay?

448
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,437
I'm on, uh...

449
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:39,274
...Highland. It's a warehouse
that runs right down to the water.

450
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,777
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.

451
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:23,235
- We did it.
- Yeah?

452
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,115
What happened to your face, man?

453
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,410
If you wanna take the ride...

454
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,787
...you gotta buy the ticket.

455
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,333
Yeah, right. Well, Derek hooked us up
with a cabin on one of those freighters.

456
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,377
South America via the Great Lakes.

457
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:45,591
Well, we're not gonna need that.
But this is appreciated.

458
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,885
One more time, bro.

459
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,013
- We did it?
- It's done.

460
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,021
Oh, I wish I could've seen the look
on her face.

461
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:00,939
No, you don't.

462
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,817
Oh, yeah, I do.

463
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,700
- Unbelievable.
- She's gonna do it.

464
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,703
Unbelievable.

465
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,250
The president is now taking the stage
here at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

466
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,503
The 2-hour delay in her appearance...

467
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,507
...due to an investigation characterized
by Press Secretary Ryan Berg...

468
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,218
...as "an over-zealous fan"...

469
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,435
- You are not going to do this.
- I'm afraid I am.

470
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,897
- Developments you need to be aware of.
- I have made my decision...

471
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,192
...and I would appreciate
you not second-guessing me.

472
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,654
I don't think you understand.
We know your secrets too.

473
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,574
We can reveal them just as easily.

474
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,411
You need to ask yourself who you
fear more. Michael Scofield...

475
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,247
...or us?

476
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,457
- You've got 30 seconds.
- Yeah.

477
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,417
I won't keep you.

478
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,587
- The world is waiting.
- Ten seconds.

479
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,632
MAN 2.. Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

480
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,012
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

481
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,933
...four, three, two...

482
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:24,606
Thank you for waiting
so patiently all afternoon.

483
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,569
If it were not for the support
of this great state...

484
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,946
...my home state of Illinois...

485
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,162
...I would not be here today.

486
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,998
Which is why I have chosen today...

487
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,294
...to make
this very important announcement.

488
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:49,631
A situation has recently come to light...

489
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,676
...and I feel that I must take action.

490
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:57,347
It is my job as president of this
great country...

491
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,184
...to make rational decisions...

492
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,311
...when I am given facts.

493
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:08,317
Decisions that are best not for me
but for the people.

494
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,945
And so...

495
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,157
...after much consideration...

496
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,535
...I regret to inform you...

497
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:24,041
...that I have been diagnosed with
a highly malignant form of cancer.

498
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,797
And because of that reason...

499
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:36,220
...I am no longer fit to serve
as your commander in chief.

500
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:42,017
In the best interest of this country,
effective immediately...

501
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:48,232
...I am stepping down
as president of the United States.

502
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:55,072
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a shocking announcement...

503
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,242
If she ain't the president,
the tape's useless.

504
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,702
She can't pardon anyone.

505
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,538
We got nothing.

506
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,293
--she will no longer serve
as the president.

507
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,045
There's only one thing we can do.

508
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,549
We gotta disappear.

509
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,594
Forever.
