1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,168
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,754
Excuse me, ladies.
I need to ask you a few questions.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,216
And that dirty Southerner,
he snuck out the back.

4
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,718
You really think
the Diaper Sniper got all of it?

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,180
If you were Bagwell and you
just got your hands on $5 million...

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,598
...where would you go?

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,892
I'm right in the city.
In the Rainbow Room.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,310
Restaurant in New York City.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,605
I am gonna be waiting in that spot.

10
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,150
And that's
<i>all that I want in this whole world...</i>

11
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,778
...is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,164
Three dots, third letter.

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,000
Rendezvous.

14
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,169
The question is, where?

15
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,921
Sundown, hot.

16
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,173
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

17
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,177
I think I owe you an apology
because I lied to you...

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,013
...about Oscar Shales.

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,850
Right there.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,018
That's where I put the bullet in him.

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,147
What are you doing, man?

22
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:09,944
You've been hired to do a job.
The reasoning does not concern you.

23
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,696
Don't ask any questions about us...

24
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,407
...we'll continue to make sure
no one asks any about you.

25
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,033
Are we clear?

26
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,370
They all die.

27
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,740
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,700
Are you new?

29
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,744
Yeah.

30
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,288
No one told me
we were getting a new volunteer.

31
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,250
I've been working the night shifts.
Clean up.

32
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,086
And Jimmy said
I could change my shift, so...

33
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,755
You know what you're doing?

34
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,633
Yeah.

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,344
- I'll see you around.
- Right.

36
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,781
- This might be Scofield.
- Copy that.

37
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,317
You take that side.

38
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,228
- Freeze!
- Take it easy, man.

39
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,731
- Stay on the ground.
- What's the deal?

40
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,817
He's gone.

41
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,784
- How you feeling?
- Okay, I guess.

42
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,243
Tired.

43
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,581
I'm a target, kid.

44
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,500
As long as you're with me, so are you.

45
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,462
Things will get a whole lot worse
before they get better. Understand?

46
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,923
After we meet up with Uncle Mike
and get to Panama.

47
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,383
Panama ain't a sure thing.

48
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,094
Your uncle's plan is dangerous.
I mean, really dangerous.

49
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,517
Listen, all the charges against you
have been dropped.

50
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:13,020
You're free and clear to start a new life.
A good life.

51
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,147
Not be running,
looking over your shoulder--

52
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,607
You want me to leave?

53
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,028
No.

54
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:28,369
- No.
- Good, because I'm not.

55
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,294
Here you go.

56
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,674
Turn the sound up on the tube, Jenny.

57
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,300
Sure, Hank.

58
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,637
Do you have any
<i>thoughts on the death of David Apolskis?</i>

59
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,305
<i>It was unfortunate.</i>

60
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,307
<i>Tests show he was shot at close range.</i>

61
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,727
- David.
- Was there ever any opportunity--?

62
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,147
Let me remind you that despite his age,
David "Tweener" Apolskis was...

63
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,482
...a fugitive who made a move
for my weapon.

64
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,986
I did not want to have to kill him.

65
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,655
Sometimes things happen
that are just out of your control.

66
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,533
That good old boy's
hunting them all down, ain't he?

67
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,494
<i>Sources claim that you have</i>
<i>recovered Scofield's hard drive.</i>

68
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,164
<i>- Obtained substantial data from it.</i>
- What sources?

69
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,709
Retrieved information detailing not
only how Scofield broke out, but how...

70
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,669
- ...he plans to stay out. Comment?
- No.

71
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,630
<i>The event at Blanding</i>
<i>Botanical Gardens earlier today...</i>

72
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,925
...that was a result
of hard drive data you collected.

73
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,427
No comment.

74
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,096
<i>Have you found other</i>
<i>locations where Scofield might be?</i>

75
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,347
<i>I said no comment.</i>

76
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,266
<i>There's something about this guy.</i>

77
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,352
<i>It's like he knows where we're going,</i>
<i>what we're thinking.</i>

78
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,229
<i>Tell us where you're heading.</i>

79
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,023
<i>What role will the hard drive play?</i>

80
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,860
Details of this
<i>investigation are extremely confidential.</i>

81
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,696
Heard it came back from the lab.
Any findings?

82
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,616
Yeah, 3200 nitroglycerine ampoules.

83
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,369
Scofield knew these needed to be
stored in a cool, moist area.

84
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,539
Best place for that in the Utah desert
is the botanical gardens.

85
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,666
- Stable?
- All medical grade.

86
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,002
Safely used by heart patients
all the time.

87
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,420
But in the aggregate--

88
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,049
It can take out an entire building.
That box right there.

89
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:10,554
This is why we can't have leaks...

90
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,640
...coming from this office.

91
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,393
God help the agent
who goes behind my back...

92
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,105
...and talks to the press.

93
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,782
Can you elaborate
<i>on your tactics in this manhunt?</i>

94
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,327
Sun Tzu
<i>said if you know your enemy...</i>

95
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,954
<i>...you need not fear 100 battles.</i>

96
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,581
<i>I know these men, who they are,</i>
<i>where they came from.</i>

97
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,667
<i>Where they want to go.</i>

98
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,173
<i>These convicts are in a constant battle.</i>

99
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,426
<i>Not only with me...</i>

100
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,096
<i>...but with themselves.</i>

101
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,725
<i>Second-guessing</i>
<i>every decision they make.</i>

102
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,772
<i>Do I turn left?</i>

103
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,316
<i>Do I turn right?</i>

104
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,279
<i>Stay or go?</i>

105
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,658
<i>My job is to know</i>
<i>how they'll answer these questions.</i>

106
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,288
<i>The only way to win a war</i>
<i>is to try to know your prey completely.</i>

107
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,833
<i>And then you get to go after</i>
<i>your enemy with everything you've got.</i>

108
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,791
Our half-price stuff's in the back.

109
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,795
- I'm looking for something very specific.
- Okay.

110
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,010
This is it.

111
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,306
- This is exactly what I need.
- Great.

112
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,603
We were just inches away today.
Inches.

113
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,063
I want these blown up huge.

114
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,774
- Put them up in my office, on the walls.
- What are these?

115
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,902
In there is information regarding
a rendezvous Scofield set up.

116
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,862
We're gonna crack that code today.
Lang!

117
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,199
Today's the day Franklin told his wife
he'll meet her at the Rainbow Room.

118
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,701
- Right.
- Wrong. Today Franklin's going down.

119
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,329
- Are you ready?
- Everything's arranged.

120
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,809
- It's all here?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,564
Yo, Ray, let's go.

122
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,359
Hey, yo, Trey. What's up, nigga?

123
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,239
- I know that ain't you.
- It ain't a ghost, man.

124
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,657
You holding up all right?

125
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,077
Just catching a whole bunch of buses
just to get here to Chi-Town, man.

126
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,579
How you think I'm supposed to feel?

127
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,332
Chris, Jay.
What's up, Flam?

128
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,042
You look like you lost a few, bro.

129
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,712
- Slim-Fast, baby.
- Is that what it is?

130
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,132
Feds been in your old lady's business,
no joke. Up in your crib.

131
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,426
- Following her around.
- Yeah, I know, man.

132
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,844
Yo, I know you love Kacee.

133
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,763
I don't know if it's a good idea
for you to come around here.

134
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,015
You're a wanted man.

135
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,850
I'm wanted because I kept
my mouth shut.

136
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,601
And I kept you out of Fox River.

137
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,271
C-Man, we feel that.
And we owe you one.

138
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,108
Good, because I'm collecting
right now.

139
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,110
My wife is waiting for me...

140
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,280
...and I am not leaving Chi-town
without my family, you understand?

141
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,117
Now, you all are gonna help me.
Let's roll out.

142
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,215
Where you going?

143
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,803
To take my kid to school.

144
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,722
I know about the Rainbow Room.

145
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,808
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Phone lines are tapped.

146
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,311
We heard your entire conversation
with your husband.

147
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,272
Since you and Dede aren't booked
on any flights to New York...

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,275
...don't tell me the Rainbow Room
is a restaurant in Manhattan.

149
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,277
Tell me where you're meeting
your husband.

150
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,864
Or I can arrest you.
Right in front of your daughter.

151
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,993
You go to hell.
I haven't done anything wrong.

152
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,956
You spoke with an escaped felon
about meeting him today.

153
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,918
You've done enough to be charged
with attempt to aid and abet.

154
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,754
Please, okay. Listen to me.

155
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,839
One phone call
and Child Welfare is here.

156
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,509
You're going to County,
Dede will be in foster care.

157
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,927
- No.
- Don't worry.

158
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,138
I hear the families
in the foster system are topnotch.

159
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,856
You are asking me to choose
between my daughter and my husband.

160
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,025
Exactly.

161
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,694
Anything?

162
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,697
I'm on the phone with
Fox River checking T-Bag's file.

163
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,409
Hey, what you got for me?

164
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:29,706
Really, 52 times? Where?

165
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,462
I owe you, Patterson.

166
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,049
We got a lot of road to cover.

167
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,279
We're good.

168
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,455
No more stops
until we get to New Mexico.

169
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,750
- You forgot your change.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,461
- Thanks.
- You were in such a rush.

171
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,588
Thanks. Thank you.

172
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,760
Keep walking. Keep walking.

173
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,263
Come on, keep walking.

174
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,893
Damn it.

175
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,613
We don't have to ditch
the car. We can keep driving.

176
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,575
We can't, the waitress
made me and the car. It's useless.

177
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,787
I'm sorry, you know.
Maybe we can find another car.

178
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,998
Cars aren't exactly
growing on trees out here.

179
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,501
We got 400 miles to go,
and no way of getting there.

180
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,337
If we don't get to Michael in time,
he'll leave without us.

181
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,672
- He wouldn't do that.
- He doesn't have a choice.

182
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,674
It's a one-shot deal out of the country.

183
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,135
I said I was sorry.

184
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,680
- There was a sign for a train station.
- It ain't that easy.

185
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,558
- We follow the road, we won't be seen.
- It ain't that easy.

186
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:17,105
Hey, I'm not an idiot.
I was on the run too, you know.

187
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,902
Yeah, you were on the run,
and you got caught.

188
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,198
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I'm not a pro
at being a con like you, Dad.

189
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,826
Maybe I should've just left
when you gave me the out.

190
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,037
- Not like you care.
- Whoa, whoa.

191
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,456
Take it easy.

192
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,211
I'm sorry, all right?

193
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,053
I'm sorry, man, I'm just...

194
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,391
Let's get out of here.

195
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,072
- Mrs. Pamela Mahone?
- Yes.

196
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,241
Agent Wayne Merrick, FBI.

197
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,868
I'd like to talk to you
about your husband.

198
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,173
I'm surprised that you're coming to me
for a background check on Alex.

199
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,592
It's standard procedure.

200
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,803
We run these kind of checks when
an agent's about to be promoted...

201
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,555
...to a higher security clearance.

202
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,516
I know that, I did this dance
the last time he was promoted.

203
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,768
I just figured that
since we were divorced...

204
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,188
I mean, I rarely speak to him,
and I certainly don't follow his career--

205
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,065
We really need to get this done today.

206
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,069
So I promise
I won't take up much of your time.

207
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,615
I've given enough time
to my ex-husband, Mr. Merrick.

208
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,950
I see.

209
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,327
The, uh...

210
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,413
The Bureau can take its toll
on your family.

211
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,290
I understand that.

212
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,293
My ex-wife is an agent...

213
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,380
...and let's just say
I know how you feel.

214
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,137
Promise me
that he won't find out we spoke?

215
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,806
Oh, it's totally confidential.

216
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:20,937
- Do you mind if I ask why?
- To be perfectly honest, he scares me.

217
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,181
<i>Information.</i>

218
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,642
Hi, I need the number
for a Sundown Hotel please.

219
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,352
<i>- What state?</i>
- All of them, please.

220
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>- Got one in Pierre, South Dakota.</i>
- Okay.

221
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,274
<i>Another in Sutton, West Virginia.</i>
<i>And one in Gila, New Mexico.</i>

222
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,022
- What can I do you for?
- A batch of them sunflowers, please.

223
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,482
If you don't mind me saying...

224
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,693
...you do not sound like
you hail from Kansas.

225
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,153
You got a sharp ear.

226
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,032
I hail from what we call
the Yellowhammer State.

227
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,201
What brings you to Tribune?

228
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,917
Sir?

229
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,087
Romance.

230
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,592
Thank you so much.

231
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,349
<i>Somebody's gonna get hurt.</i>

232
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,810
Feds gonna be swinging
bigger bats than these.

233
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,480
- We gotta have ours.
- Look, man, that's all we need.

234
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,941
Is your car, your truck,
and some guts, man.

235
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,401
We don't need all of this.

236
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,945
- Maybe we should think about it.
- I said no.

237
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,116
What's gonna happen, man,
when the bullets start flying?

238
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,535
Can you guarantee
my family ain't gonna get hurt?

239
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,288
Johnny Law's gonna be strapped up.
I'm going in hot.

240
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,249
- I don't think you heard me.
- No, I don't think you heard me.

241
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,418
I'm not going in naked.

242
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,921
I know we said
we'd ride with you on this...

243
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,465
...but I'm not going in there
without some of these.

244
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,726
You wanna punk out, man?

245
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,688
Then punk out,
because I can do this myself.

246
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,319
Ain't nobody punking out.
And no guns.

247
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,453
But you better be right about this.
If bullets do start flying...

248
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,831
...the only blood being spilt
is gonna be ours.

249
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,999
You feel me?

250
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,669
I feel you.

251
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,298
Agent Kellerman!

252
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,217
- Agent Kellerman!
- Yes?

253
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,469
That name you wanted me to track.
Kelli Foster.

254
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,056
She booked a flight to New Mexico.
Just landed.

255
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,142
- Got someone on her?
- No, but we got an ID on her rental car.

256
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,855
- Should I update Mr. Kim?
- No, I'll take care of this myself.

257
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,611
We got a tip from a waitress who
thinks she saw Burrows and his son.

258
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,240
- St. David, Arizona.
- Get a road team there to confirm.

259
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,909
Once they get a beat on Burrows,
notify me immediately.

260
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,203
Everybody out. Let's go, come on.

261
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,792
Yeah?

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,879
Sara Tancredi just booked
a one-way ticket across the country.

263
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,508
- To where?
- New Mexico.

264
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,387
Of course.

265
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,181
- Any luck breaking that code?
- Not yet.

266
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,517
<i>- But this helps.</i>
- Good.

267
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,736
- Wheeler!
- Sir?

268
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,238
Every combination that has NM in it.

269
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:44,242
I want you to check it to see if
it contains a location in New Mexico.

270
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,744
- I want it done now.
- Now?

271
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,412
Yeah, right now.

272
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,249
<i>So how well do you know Alex?</i>

273
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,418
He knows me better than I know him.

274
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,756
He's a closed book, all right.
But he wasn't always like that.

275
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,134
In the first few years
of our marriage...

276
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:05,221
...he was actually romantic.

277
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,098
Hm.

278
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,895
And then one day, out of nowhere...

279
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,944
- Out of nowhere, what?
- Everything changed.

280
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,239
- He became obsessed with getting out.
- Out of the marriage?

281
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,116
Getting out of the marriage.

282
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,869
Getting me out of the house,
out of his life.

283
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,246
He left me.

284
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,333
He left the both of us.

285
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,254
You said you were scared of him.
Why is that?

286
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,091
He started acting strange.

287
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,095
Started spending all of his time
in the backyard gardening, of all things.

288
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,805
I mean, the man was a neat freak.

289
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,266
He'd throw away a pair of shoes
if they even got scuffed.

290
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,852
But he'd be out there,
all covered in dirt...

291
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,357
...and surrounded by these huge bags
offer tilizer and lye.

292
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:01,277
We just put this new sod in,
and he just tore it all up...

293
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,488
...and planted a flower bed.

294
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,532
And I went out back once
to talk to him.

295
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,160
And he screamed at me...

296
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,998
...and said not to come near
the garden.

297
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,291
Said that it was his.

298
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,799
I'm sorry. If you--
If you wanna take a break.

299
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:27,178
All I wanted was an explanation
why things ended so suddenly.

300
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,098
And all Alex could say was:

301
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,853
"Sometimes things happen
that are just out of your control."

302
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,548
So the picture
in your daughter's bedroom.

303
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,218
The exact location where it was taken
was a merry-go-round, right?

304
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,679
Yeah.

305
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,057
All you have to do
is wait by the merry-go-round.

306
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,559
Right where Benjamin's expecting you.

307
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,855
Is that necessary?

308
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,900
- I mean, Benjamin's not even--
- It's precautionary.

309
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:30,200
Look, I do this,
you leave me and my child alone.

310
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,911
You have my word.

311
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,392
Is my wife there?

312
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,188
- Yeah, she's here.
- Well, let's go get her.

313
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,869
Number three,
<i>confirm you're in position, number one.</i>

314
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:32,720
In 15 seconds a black Jeep is gonna
pull up by the parking lot entrance.

315
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,139
Run to it.

316
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,600
Chris?

317
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,355
Go!

318
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,568
- I can't, they're gonna take Dede.
- No, they won't.

319
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,195
Is that guy talking to her?
Get a read on him.

320
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,905
<i>Move to positions.</i>

321
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,574
It's taken care of. Go!

322
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,122
Go!

323
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,589
She's running. She's running.
Go, go, go! Move, move!

324
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,688
Get in! Hold on.

325
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,994
It's a 2007 black Jeep.
License plates have been removed.

326
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,038
We're in pursuit, headed-- No!

327
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,966
Move the truck.

328
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,343
I said, move it!

329
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,227
- Where is my child?
- Here.

330
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,855
- Dede?
- Hey, it's me, baby.

331
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:10,276
Hey, look, I just wanna tell you
that everything is gonna be okay.

332
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,695
We're gonna be a family again,
I promise you that.

333
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,073
Where is Dede?
He said that you had her!

334
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,824
No, no, no. Be easy, baby.

335
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,954
Be easy. Trey is picking her up
from school right now.

336
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,376
Dede Franklin, Dawson Elementary.
I want her pulled from school. Now.

337
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,087
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

338
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,465
They say she's taking a test, man.
But I think they're stalling.

339
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,723
What about Oscar Shales?

340
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,768
Oscar Shales? Why is he important?

341
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:52,902
Well, he's just the only fugitive
to ever successfully elude...

342
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,612
...your ex-husband.

343
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,365
Alex was consumed with finding him.

344
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,868
I mean, after what Shales did to all
of his victims, who could blame him?

345
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,247
It was all he worked on,
all he did for a year.

346
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,792
But I don't think that it was the stress
of chasing Shales...

347
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,211
...that caused Alex
to start behaving erratically.

348
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,796
Why is that?

349
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,882
Because Alex changed
after the trail went cold.

350
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,468
I remember it like it was yesterday.

351
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:23,308
He just walked into the kitchen,
after 12 years of marriage...

352
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,811
...and says that he wanted me
out of the house immediately.

353
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,814
I'll never forget the date.

354
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,150
It was June 15th.

355
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,321
I think I have everything I need.

356
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,949
You didn't even ask
about social history or education.

357
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,785
- That's standard in these checks.
- That's been handled.

358
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,873
I have to get these reports filed
with Strategic Operations, ASAP.

359
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,043
- You're with Strategic Operations?
- They handle these checks.

360
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,921
Not since the 9/11 realignment,
Mr. Merrick.

361
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,799
The chief information officer
does them now.

362
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,469
They handled Alex's last check.

363
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,640
When an agent reaches a level
as high as your ex-husband's...

364
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,143
...S.O. takes over again.

365
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,898
Bureaucracies.
Thank you for the coffee.

366
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,991
Look, just get her out of there.

367
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,578
They're here.

368
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,706
No, no, no.

369
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,420
- No, see, we gotta go.
- Don't worry about it.

370
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,714
Just get the car started, all right? Go.

371
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,725
Keep your eyes on your own paper.

372
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,019
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby.

373
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,271
- You ready to go?
- Where are we going?

374
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,775
- Disneyland.
- Mr. Franklin, you can't...

375
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,361
- FBI, stop!
- Get him, get him!

376
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,118
Come on, let's go!

377
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,702
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby.

378
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,579
Come on, go, go, go!

379
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,626
Franklin has the child!
Repeat, Franklin has the child!

380
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,719
<i>Evening, Mrs. Hollander.</i>

381
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,638
<i>Don't you look lovely this evening?</i>

382
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:30,309
You should've told me what you were.
My God, I let you near my children!

383
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,063
Don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

384
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,582
Come on now, get away
from the road. You wanna get caught?

385
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,336
I, uh...

386
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,965
I saw you checking out those girls
back at the diner.

387
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,469
- What?
- Come on, fess up.

388
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,846
No, I was making sure
they weren't staring at us.

389
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,182
With what, their asses?

390
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,186
Beautiful girls in Panama.
They love Americans.

391
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,729
Cool.

392
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,524
So how long you known about girls?

393
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,861
Long enough.

394
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,280
Since when?

395
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,660
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?

396
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,495
With who?

397
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,249
- Donna Anselmi.
- She was the kid next door.

398
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,502
- She was about...
- Four years older than me?

399
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,921
Your mom was paying her
for French lessons.

400
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,090
Well, she earned the money.

401
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,928
Come on. Away from the road.

402
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,430
You're still way too close. Let's go.

403
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,894
<i>Wanna learn tricks, Gracey?</i>

404
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,479
Like what?

405
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>I let you into my life.</i>

406
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,907
Eighteen, 27.

407
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,416
<i>Evening, Mrs. Hollander.</i>

408
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,994
How you feeling, little Teddy?

409
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,833
NM, six...

410
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,672
NM.

411
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,427
Three.

412
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,847
NM.

413
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,192
NM, 6-3.

414
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,989
NM, NM, NM...

415
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,040
Tomorrow.

416
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,012
Pam, I really can't talk right now.

417
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,348
<i>Maybe I should call back.</i>

418
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,563
- Who is this?
- I think you already know.

419
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,371
If you've done anything
to Pam or my boy--

420
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,915
<i>We both know your family's fine.</i>

421
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,460
<i>Although Pam did seem a little upset</i>
<i>about you leaving.</i>

422
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,797
<i>But then, you had to, didn't you?</i>

423
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,591
<i>Because you couldn't let her find out.</i>

424
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:18,556
- Find out about what?
<i>- Oscar Shales, you remember?</i>

425
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,142
The one that got away.

426
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,271
<i>Except he didn't get too far, did he?</i>

427
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,691
- Ah, you're slipping, Scofield.
<i>- Maybe.</i>

428
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,360
Let's hypothesize for a moment.

429
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,613
Let's pretend
I was the one who caught Shales.

430
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,827
<i>I don't think I could have just handed</i>
<i>that psychopath over to the courts.</i>

431
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,079
<i>Not after he had eluded me</i>
<i>for so long.</i>

432
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,707
Made me look bad.

433
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,752
You've been out in the sun
way too long, boy.

434
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,628
<i>You Feds make a nice living.</i>

435
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,465
<i>But not so nice you go around</i>
<i>tearing up expensive sod.</i>

436
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,508
Not unless you had to do
a little digging.

437
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,552
Not unless you wanted
to hide something.

438
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,555
<i>Or someone.</i>

439
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,685
That's what all the lye was for,
wasn't it?

440
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,313
<i>See, because</i>
<i>there are two kinds of lye.</i>

441
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,400
<i>Small amounts of the first kind</i>
<i>can be a gardener's best friend.</i>

442
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,487
And large bags of the other kind
decomposes bodies.

443
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,864
Oh, you should write mystery novels.

444
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,616
<i>I don't know about you...</i>

445
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,328
...but if I buried someone
in my own back yard...

446
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,499
<i>...I'd think about it all the time.</i>

447
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>I'd think maybe I should</i>
<i>move that body.</i>

448
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,175
<i>Then I'd remember...</i>

449
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:40,638
<i>...that DNA leaches into soil,</i>
<i>so even when the body was gone...</i>

450
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,349
...the proof of what I'd done
would still be there.

451
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,186
<i>I can imagine how it feels.</i>

452
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,190
<i>The pressure.</i>

453
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,568
The constant fear.

454
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,031
It's more than a man can bear.

455
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,453
<i>I'm gonna give you a chance.</i>

456
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,542
Back off, let me
and my family disappear.

457
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:14,713
<i>And in return,</i>
<i>I'll keep your little secret.</i>

458
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,466
<i>How does that sound?</i>

459
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,136
Like a dead man talking.

460
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,306
<i>I know it's not</i>
<i>how you wanted this to play out.</i>

461
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,394
But sometimes things happen
that are just...

462
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,022
<i>...out of your control.</i>

463
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,068
<i>This is one of those times.</i>

464
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,530
Take care of yourself.

465
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,576
I'll see you soon, Michael.

466
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:51,417
Oh, and Michael,
it just may be sooner than you think.

467
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,979
Did you have a nice nap?

468
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,524
Visions of 12-year-olds
dancing in your head?

469
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:20,237
- You're trespassing.
- Nobody lives here anymore, Goldilocks.

470
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,197
Seems the owner hit the bricks...

471
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:26,076
...as soon as she heard a certain
someone had re-entered society.

472
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,079
Left in a hurry too.
Even left some stuff behind.

473
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:35,461
So this is where Theodore
practiced "Pervert Knows Best."

474
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,134
This is where he had his family supper.

475
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,387
And that, I believe...

476
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,933
...is where you and Mrs. Hollander
expressed your love.

477
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,228
Tell me, little Teddy,
did you make her wear Dr. Dentons...

478
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:57,149
...and hold a lunchbox
to help you get all worked up?

479
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,818
Bradley, I couldn't possibly expect...

480
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,905
...a grown man
who still lives with his mama...

481
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,241
...to understand the machinations
of love.

482
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,462
You want to know how we found you?

483
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,925
Fifty-two mash notes
sent by you to this address.

484
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:28,681
All of them begging Mrs. Hollander
to take your white-trash ass back.

485
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:33,143
And every one of them
boomeranged to Fox River...

486
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,688
...marked "Return To Sender."

487
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,441
The guards had a real laugh
reading them, didn't we, Geary?

488
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,360
Oh, damn right, we did.

489
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:46,991
That is one mangy looking paw
you got there, slick.

490
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,202
What happened, Boy Scout fight back?
Geary.

491
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,037
Now, you're gonna tell me...

492
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,707
...where you stashed
Westmoreland's money.

493
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,794
Or I'm gonna pluck you
like a chicken, stitch by stitch.

494
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,431
Fine, you wanna know
where the money is?

495
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,226
I did spend a whole bunch of it
last night on your mama.

496
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,732
Wrong answer.

497
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,459
Come on, baby.

498
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,545
How are you?

499
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,047
You're good?

500
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,632
- Yeah.
- She's okay.

501
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,150
- Baby.
- Yeah?

502
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,612
What do we do now?

503
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,142
We didn't have to wait too long at all.

504
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,397
What are we gonna do?

505
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,068
Get a ticket on the train. Come on.

506
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,613
Just wait here until the train comes.

507
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,942
Yeah, I think that's
the guy right over there.

508
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,959
Two Caucasian males on foot,
fleeing the Willcox station.

509
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,129
I'm running.

510
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,643
L.J!

511
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,646
- L.J!
- Hold it right there.

512
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,648
- Stop.
- Don't move.

513
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,524
Please, please.

514
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,818
- He's got nothing to do with this.
- Face down!

515
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,904
- Please.
- Now!

516
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,573
Cuff them.

517
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,537
L.J., I'm sorry.

518
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,834
Suspect in custody.
Possible ID, Lincoln Burrows.

519
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:16,551
I'm sorry. L.J., I'm sorry.
