1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,960
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,212
We're staying.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,382
Give them hell.

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,431
Bill, don't do this.

5
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,393
<i>I've dedicated my life to this country,</i>
<i>to President Reynolds.</i>

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,479
<i>- I've been a perfect soldier.</i>
- Every photo, file. Get rid of all.

7
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,730
<i>Bill, don't do this.</i>

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,440
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,567
<i>I'm gonna gut you, bow to stern.</i>

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,986
I did not kill Roy Geary!
Bagwell set me up!

11
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,031
You are under arrest
for the murder of Roy William Geary.

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,659
My therapist said
that I need to confront you...

13
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,994
...to let you know how betrayed I feel.

14
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,248
This is the Tribune Police.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,543
Just as long as you do your job,
we'll forget about Shales.

16
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,838
And then you can go back to Colorado
and visit your son, Cameron.

17
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,842
Don't you ever mention his name again.

18
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,427
What about your friend there?

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,431
If we're gonna go down,
might as well go down swinging.

20
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,064
- Sara.
<i>- Michael?</i>

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,366
- Almost made it.
<i>- Hello?</i>

22
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,619
<i>Hello, Michael?</i>

23
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,748
<i>- Is that you?</i>
- Get up.

24
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,878
Turn around.

25
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,463
Turn around!

26
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,550
If you're gonna murder us, Alex, you have
to look us in the eyes while you do it.

27
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,552
- Shut up.
- You want me, you got me.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,053
Let my brother go!

29
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,056
I don't want either of you.
I just want my life back!

30
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,225
You're gonna kill two innocent men
to get it, huh?

31
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,643
Absolutely.

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,229
<i>This is the United States Border Patrol.</i>

33
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>Drop the weapon</i>
<i>and remain where you are.</i>

34
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,984
<i>Drop the weapon.</i>

35
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,781
United States Border Patrol!
Drop your weapon!

36
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,991
All agents hold your positions.

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,077
I'm FBI. These men are in my custody.

38
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,662
I don't care who you are.

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,000
Until we verify, you will drop
your weapon or we will drop you.

40
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,710
Your choice.

41
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,099
Move in!

42
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,186
Hands on your head now!

43
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,856
Don't move.

44
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,114
You got anything to drink?

45
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,033
Check the back.

46
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,286
Unknown rider,
<i>unknown rider. This is DEA on guard.</i>

47
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,372
<i>Radio frequency--</i>

48
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,126
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

49
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,713
- What do you mean, "uh-oh"?
- Border Patrol's on our ass, man.

50
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,384
- How long till we get to Mexico?
- We're already in Mexico, papi.

51
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,344
I thought they couldn't follow...

52
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,638
- ...once we cross the border.
- Not since 9/11.

53
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,391
<i>Unknown rider, unknown rider.</i>

54
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,184
What are we gonna do?

55
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,895
Pull the cord and pray.

56
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,814
Oh, hell, no.

57
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,234
Look, we try and land the plane,
we're pinched for sure.

58
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,902
And if we jump?

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,280
We're in the middle of the desert.

60
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,157
Patrol'll have a hard time
trying to find us once we land.

61
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,993
If we land.

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,411
Oh, you gonna land.

63
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,079
It's just a matter of how hard.

64
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,291
Good luck, amigo.

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,602
<i>We're receiving reports</i>
<i>that escaped convicts...</i>

66
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,563
<i>...Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield</i>
<i>have been apprehended...</i>

67
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,190
<i>...just a few miles north</i>
<i>of the U.S.-Mexican border.</i>

68
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,695
<i>Federal Agent Mahone, with assistance</i>
<i>from the United States Border Patrol...</i>

69
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,448
<i>...took the men into custody</i>
<i>just a short time ago.</i>

70
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>Now, not a lot of information</i>
<i>available...</i>

71
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,244
<i>...but the brothers were apprehended</i>
<i>without incident...</i>

72
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,789
<i>...while attempting to leave the country</i>
<i>through the deserts of New Mexico.</i>

73
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,500
<i>A long way from</i>
<i>Illinois' Fox River State Penitentiary...</i>

74
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,337
<i>...where they escaped from</i>
<i>less than 10 days ago.</i>

75
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,340
<i>The Fox River Eight, as the group</i>
<i>of convicts were once known...</i>

76
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,927
<i>...are now down to four,</i>
<i>as only Benjamin Miles Franklin...</i>

77
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,806
<i>...Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik,</i>
<i>and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.</i>

78
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>- Officials say it's only--</i>
- Sir?

79
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,436
He just heard, and he'd like to see you.

80
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,812
<i>--back behind prison walls.</i>

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,899
<i>Tips continue to pour in</i>

82
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,529
<i>- -are now down to four,</i>

00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,951
<i>...and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.</i>

85
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,535
- Godspeed.
<i>- Officials say it's a matter of days...</i>

86
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,540
<i>...before the rest of the Fox River Eight</i>
<i>are back behind prison walls.</i>

87
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,669
<i>Tips continue to pour in</i>
<i>to manhunt's national hot line...</i>

88
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:59,173
<i>...and officials believe all four fugitives</i>
<i>are still on American soil...</i>

89
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,719
<i>...allaying fears that they may have</i>
<i>escaped across the Mexican border...</i>

90
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,477
Excuse me, sarge.

91
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,772
I was wondering if you
could help a brother out.

92
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,273
With what?

93
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,820
I only recently returned from delivering
democracy to the desert...

94
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,615
...and I was wondering
if you could tell me...

95
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,785
...how a guy goes about getting
one of those prosthetic jobbies.

96
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,122
Didn't they make you whole
before they shipped you?

97
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,544
Let's just say the doctor made the bed,
he just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

98
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,007
Best thing for you to do is go on
down there to the VA, get in line.

99
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,300
That simple?

100
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,969
Yeah.

101
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,972
Till they send you the bill,
and you gotta pay it.

102
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,558
Those bastards in Washington
send us to fight for them.

103
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,395
- Not a damn one of them fights for us.
- Man, that is a crime.

104
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,107
But luckily for me, uh...

105
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,234
...money is not the issue.

106
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,819
Is that right?

107
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:06,240
Any particular forms I might need
in order to qualify?

108
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,326
You know what,
Mr. Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell?

109
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,580
You figured out how to dye
that hair of yours...

110
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,582
...up like a nancy all by yourself.

111
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,334
You sure as hell can figure out
how to get a prosthetic...

112
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,754
...for that stump of yours by yourself.

113
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:28,095
Yeah, I think I got a pretty good idea
where to start.

114
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,489
I'm here with Ed Pavelka, the
new warden of Fox River Penitentiary...

115
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,783
...where Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

116
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,368
...are scheduled to be returned to
some time tomorrow.

117
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,788
Now, warden, the escape happened
a mere two days...

118
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,248
...before Burrows was scheduled
to be put to death.

119
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,919
He's already been granted one day.
Do you anticipate any further?

120
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,297
Lincoln Burrows is a convicted murderer.

121
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,801
His escape has endangered the lives
of civilians across this country.

122
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,221
He is not a celebrity. He is not a martyr.

123
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,975
I can assure you that whatever leniency
was afforded him and other prisoners...

124
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,521
...under the old regime at Fox River
will no longer be tolerated.

125
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,150
The only thing that Burrows can expect
is what a jury of his peers demanded:

126
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,236
A speedy execution.

127
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,321
And Michael Scofield?

128
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,324
With his escape,
the aiding and abetting charges...

129
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:34,745
...the felonies he's racked up along the
way on top of his original sentence...

130
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:39,458
...I'd say Scofield will be spending the
rest of his life behind bars. Thank you.

131
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,877
Warden, one more question, sir.

132
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,666
Who's got Mahone?

133
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,005
- Congratulations, sir.
- What do you got?

134
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,882
Uh, a call from the Illinois DOC.

135
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,843
They're sending a contingent
to collect Burrows and Scofield...

136
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,511
...take them back to Fox River.

137
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,723
Remind them this is a federal case,
we'll handle transport. Now--

138
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,975
It's an election year.
Collar this big, everybody wants a piece.

139
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,395
Warden called in a favor
to the Bureau chief.

140
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,063
<i>He okayed it, so here we are.</i>

141
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,899
<i>Should be there in about an hour.</i>

142
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,194
I wanna be placed
in the prisoner-transport vehicle.

143
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,654
- What for?
- Just get it done.

144
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,117
Sir, these were the big fish,
and you brought them in.

145
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,620
You should feel good about that.

146
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,208
Yeah.

147
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,211
<i>Well, at least we're together.</i>

148
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,546
Yes, there is that.

149
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,426
What are you thinking?

150
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,637
Thinking about the old man.

151
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,766
What he tried to do, you know.

152
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,895
Tough to go down swinging
when you're locked in a box.

153
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,942
This isn't over yet.
We're entitled to a phone call.

154
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,612
We make that call to Sara and she has
the information Dad said she has...

155
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,198
...we can get you exonerated
before this thing goes down.

156
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,283
- Michael, it's...
- Hey.

157
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,788
We're entitled to a phone call.

158
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:45,125
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

159
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,713
And that won't happen until you're back
in Fox River, so sit tight.

160
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,095
It's not over yet.

161
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,888
Not yet.

162
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,767
A lot of ground to cover
between here and Illinois.

163
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,894
I mean...

164
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,814
What are the chances
we even make it to Fox River alive?

165
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,696
<i>Saw you on the news, Alex.</i>

166
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,115
- Did you?
<i>- The brothers too.</i>

167
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,784
They were a little more, um...

168
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,995
...breathing than I'd hoped.

169
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,788
Yeah, well, Border Patrol showed up.

170
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,665
- Nothing I could do.
<i>- Really?</i>

171
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,669
Burrows and Scofield,
can you see them from where you are?

172
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,132
- Yeah.
<i>- Then put a bullet in their heads.</i>

173
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,677
- They're being watched.
<i>- I don't care.</i>

174
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,886
<i>By armed guards.</i>

175
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,473
They make it back to Fox River,
it is over for all of us.

176
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,768
<i>Not much more this country loves</i>
<i>than a bad man with a good story.</i>

177
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,354
How much longer do you think
it'll be before someone...

178
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,524
- ...puts a microphone in front of them?
- Hey, are you listening?

179
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,194
With the security here, what you're
asking me to do is tantamount to suicide.

180
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,614
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I wasn't asking anything.

181
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,200
That would imply
you had a say in the matter.

182
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,914
Pull this off and you
are halfway home, Alex.

183
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,376
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

184
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,796
90 West End Avenue.
White fence, red door.

185
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,673
You stay away from my family.

186
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,484
Ahem. You got
a little something on your, uh...

187
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,278
No. Here, let me.

188
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,115
I'm so--

189
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,576
- Pardon my forwardness. I--
- It's okay. Thank you.

190
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,120
Normally, I wouldn't intervene.

191
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,624
It's just, yesterday when I was--
I got home from work...

192
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,627
...I found what looked like
the Brazilian rain forest...

193
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,587
...lodged between my two front teeth.

194
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,801
All I could think about was the number
of people who must've seen, and not...

195
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,470
Not a damn one of them
had the decency to tell me.

196
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,558
Mild diastema.

197
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,226
Excuse me?

198
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,939
It's a slight gap
between your eight and nine.

199
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,275
Your two front teeth.

200
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,195
And that it sometimes can act
as a magnet for food...

201
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,324
...like broccoli and tuna,
and sometimes rice.

202
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,993
Or relish.

203
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,995
All this and brains too?

204
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,832
- What are you a dentist or a...?
- Me? No. Hardly, no.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,500
I could never.

206
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,503
- My ex. My ex-husband, he was--
- A bastard?

207
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,631
That too.

208
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,767
Have you ever been to Italy, uh...?

209
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:35,481
- Denise.
- Denise. That's a lovely name.

210
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,441
Um...

211
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:44,031
You know, in Italy they have wine
every day with lunch.

212
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,284
And what do we do in this country?
We power our food down...

213
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,704
...with caffeine, carbonation
and high-fructose corn syrup.

214
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:55,584
No one ever takes the time
to enjoy things anymore.

215
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,673
Denise, would you do me the honor...

216
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,887
...of enjoying the rest of your lunch
with me?

217
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,851
I think I'd like that.

218
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,063
White or red?

219
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,361
And with limited financial
resources, he poses no flight risk--

220
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,822
Unless he'd rather not stand trial
for capital murder.

221
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,117
The defendant has shown
great resourcefulness...

222
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,913
...in being able to travel across country
with little money.

223
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,916
There's no reason
he couldn't do it again.

224
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,753
If you don't want to believe me,
believe Mr. Bellick.

225
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,715
<i>You thieving son of a bitch.</i>

226
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,593
<i>You better get down on your knees</i>
<i>and pray I never find you.</i>

227
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:51,848
<i>Because if I do, mark my words,</i>
<i>I will gut you, bow to stern.</i>

228
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:59,273
He promised to kill Mr. Geary,
and then he kept that promise.

229
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,278
A man like the defendant
should not be out in society.

230
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,741
I concur. Bail denied.

231
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,642
Who would that be?

232
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,061
Only one person.

233
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,023
Michael, it's me.
Listen, this phone rang last night...

234
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,692
...and I went to answer it,
but I couldn't hear anything.

235
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,820
And I wonder
if maybe it was you. Um...

236
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,698
<i>I don't know what I should do,</i>
<i>if I should leave a message...</i>

237
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,327
...or who might be listening,
but, um... I, uh--

238
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,539
I need to know that you're okay.
Um, I need you to know that I'm not.

239
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,876
I didn't leave you in Gila. Something
happened to me and I don't...

240
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,380
Um, I don't know what to do.
I'm not too sure where to go...

241
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,717
<i>...but I know that you're the only person</i>
<i>I can trust, and I need you to, um...</i>

242
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,723
Uh... I need you to be okay,
and, um...

243
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,311
And I need you. Please.

244
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,154
<i>Stand by to receive</i>
<i>Border Patrol transport.</i>

245
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,579
Incoming prisoners. Stand by.

246
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,415
Yes, sir.

247
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,890
Alexander Mahone, Bureau.

248
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,603
These are my prisoners,
and I will be personally escorting them...

249
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,690
- ...in their transfer vehicle.
- You can follow in a chase car.

250
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,775
I don't believe you heard me.

251
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,777
I'll be accompanying them
in their tran--

252
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,531
Only people allowed in the van
are the driver and guards...

253
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,909
...who've been trained and certified
in prisoner transport.

254
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,040
Are you really gonna make me
go over your head?

255
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,626
I'll even dial the phone for you.

256
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,629
This is standard procedure,
Agent Mahone.

257
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,466
We need to keep that environment
as controllable as possible.

258
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,802
The more bodies, the less control.

259
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,723
These men may have knowledge
of the location of the other escapees.

260
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,226
This is knowledge that I...

261
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,853
I need to do my job.

262
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,231
And my job is to ensure
the safe and successful transfer...

263
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,900
...of these two prisoners.

264
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,445
The chase vehicles are right outside.

265
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,287
We're coming to you
<i>live from the Border Patrol facility...</i>

266
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,873
<i>...in Alamogordo, New Mexico,</i>
<i>where Lincoln Burrows...</i>

267
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,334
<i>...and Michael Scofield</i>
<i>are being transferred--</i>

268
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,086
There better be a good reason
why those brothers are alive.

269
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,088
Bad day, Bill?

270
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,259
Sorry, I thought this was someone
who still existed.

271
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,513
<i>- How's the jerky business, Owen?</i>
- It's looking good right about now.

272
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,098
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

273
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,810
You don't kill Burrows and Scofield
today, so are you.

274
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,355
<i>You know it and I know it, and luckily</i>
<i>for you, I know how to save your ass.</i>

275
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,737
The brothers are already
being transferred.

276
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,280
You're too late.

277
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,700
Actually, the transport van is exactly
where you want them to be, Bill.

278
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,871
- Why?
- Why?

279
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,040
You want my help, Bill?
I want my job back.

280
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,042
<i>That means direct access</i>
<i>to the president.</i>

281
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,921
<i>- I report only to her.</i>
- You're reaching, Paul. Goodbye.

282
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,841
<i>Don't shut me out, Bill.</i>
<i>You think Burrows and Scofield...</i>

283
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,677
<i>...are a threat to this administration?</i>
<i>I know everything...</i>

284
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,138
<i>...Caroline Reynolds has ever done.</i>
<i>Everything.</i>

285
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,933
Now, before you panic,
all I am asking...

286
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,644
...is to be allowed to finish the job
that I started.

287
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,896
<i>To prove to the president and to you...</i>

288
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,983
...that I am still an asset
to this administration.

289
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,862
What's your plan?

290
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,157
<i>I have an old associate</i>
<i>in the Illinois DOC.</i>

291
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,659
<i>They're heading up the transfer.</i>

292
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,161
<i>It's gonna take</i>
<i>more than one guy on the inside.</i>

293
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,914
<i>Not if the guy's in the right place.</i>

294
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,877
Bill, you give me the go-ahead on this,
and those brothers get in the van...

295
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,212
...it'll be the last thing they ever do.

296
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,618
I have never done that before.

297
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,290
Then I guess we was making up
for some lost time.

298
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,088
I have to ask, Sam,
are you married or something?

299
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,424
Me? No.

300
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,217
- What makes you think--?
- Come on.

301
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,136
I may be plain, but I'm not a fool.

302
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,973
Usually, the men I end up with are just
looking for something, you know...

303
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,059
...on the side.

304
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,980
Denise, the only side
I'm interested in...

305
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,274
...is the inside.

306
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,651
And that place within you...

307
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,071
...is not plain.

308
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,993
- I have to get back to work.
- Do you really?

309
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,328
I have to close tonight.

310
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,165
How about I pick you up after?

311
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,042
We can have dinner.

312
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,336
- Are you sure?
- Denise.

313
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,338
I insist.

314
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,523
- Yeah?
- Good news.

315
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,358
<i>You're off the hook.</i>

316
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:02,278
Paul Kellerman has a team ready to move
on the caravan outside of Albuquerque.

317
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,614
Okay, so where does that leave us?

318
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:08,034
When it goes down, there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

319
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,663
A certain amount of confusion,
lots of bullets flying...

320
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,334
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

321
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,631
A little early to be covering your tracks,
isn't it?

322
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,677
The escapees, that was our deal.

323
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,388
<i>- That's all.</i>
- Right.

324
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,348
Our deal.

325
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:35,562
Refresh my memory. Our deal supposed
to end with Burrows and Scofield...

326
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,648
...going back to prison,
or bleeding from a hole in their heads?

327
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,570
We're giving you a chance
to make this right, Alex.

328
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,240
Just let Kellerman take care of it.
Let him be our Oswald.

329
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,992
And that makes me your Jack Ruby.

330
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,994
<i>Jack Ruby was working alone.</i>

331
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,998
<i>You've got the support of the</i>
<i>United States government behind you.</i>

332
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,666
Good luck in Albuquerque.

333
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,763
I promise, sir, this'll all be over shortly.

334
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,391
And it'll be back to business as usual.

335
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,939
- Do you regret it?
- What?

336
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,861
Knowing what you know now,
do you regret helping me?

337
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,114
You'd have done
the same thing for me.

338
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,911
- You think?
- I know.

339
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,456
You didn't answer the question.

340
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,127
I don't regret the act.

341
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,215
Just how it turned out.

342
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,220
We've got
a premeditated murder on our hands.

343
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,514
You wanted to steal money
then kill the witness.

344
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,517
Are you my attorney or theirs?
I told you, I didn't do anything.

345
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,144
No, I'm just explaining their theory
of what happened.

346
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,897
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill Geary...

347
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:05,276
...because you were too busy trying to
steal 5 million in federally insured money?

348
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,320
Probably not the best move.

349
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,073
- But there is good news.
- What's that?

350
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,325
The DA is willing to offer a deal.

351
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,537
- Twenty-five years.
- No.

352
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,832
Brad, they'll drop the capital charge.
No death penalty.

353
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,625
No!

354
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,212
- I'll be almost 65 when I get out.
- But you'd get out.

355
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,965
If this case goes to trial,
there's an excellent chance...

356
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,675
...you're sentenced to death.

357
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,178
Now, I've been doing this a while,
and I can tell you.

358
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,305
These things never go down good.

359
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,810
When the system wants you,
they get you, one way or another.

360
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,862
Part of the deal's gotta be
I do my time in Illinois.

361
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,866
So I can be near my mom.

362
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,887
Where are they taking us?

363
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,471
Another foster home.

364
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,807
I don't wanna go. I liked it there.

365
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,475
I know you did.

366
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,812
It's because of you,
the reason they're making us move?

367
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,400
- You were getting in trouble again?
- Yeah, and I'm sorry.

368
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,242
Seems like I've been dragging you
in trouble my whole life.

369
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,579
Pulled me out of some too.

370
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,082
Yeah.

371
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,608
- Yeah?
- Alex, Paul Kellerman.

372
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,444
- Have you spoken with Bill Kim?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

373
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,614
Yeah, he filled me in.
You're staging in Albuquerque.

374
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,242
Listen, me jumping in at this point.

375
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,578
It in no way reflects my feelings
about the job you've been doing.

376
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,622
<i>I just wanted you to know that.</i>

377
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,624
Of course.

378
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,960
So long as we get the job done.

379
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,629
We all get to go back
to our families, right?

380
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,048
The sooner the better.

381
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,550
So, what do I need to know?

382
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,013
As we first reported
<i>last night, after nine days on the run...</i>

383
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,641
<i>...fugitives Lincoln Burrows</i>
<i>and Michael Scofield...</i>

384
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,311
<i>...two of the masterminds behind</i>
<i>the desperate Fox River Eight escape...</i>

385
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,982
<i>...were apprehended by Border Patrol</i>
<i>officials near the Mexican border...</i>

386
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,568
<i>...and are being transferred back</i>
<i>to Fox River Penitentiary today.</i>

387
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,946
<i>Officials say Burrows,</i>
<i>who was scheduled to die...</i>

388
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,782
<i>...for the murder of Reynolds' brother,</i>
<i>Terrence Steadman...</i>

389
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,120
<i>...could have his execution rescheduled</i>
<i>for as early as late next week.</i>

390
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,414
<i>With the number of felonies</i>
<i>the pair now face...</i>

391
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,624
<i>...Burrows' brother, Michael Scofield--</i>

392
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,420
- What's going on?
- Let me go check.

393
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,385
- What do you see?
- I'll let you know.

394
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,933
How much time is it gonna take
to move this?

395
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,186
I've got my men working on it now.

396
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,906
- What's going on up there?
- Are you in a hurry?

397
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,078
Hey, we need some help
getting this rig out of the road.

398
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,502
Linc.

399
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,008
Come on.

400
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,805
All right, let's say we get the cuffs off.
Where do we go?

401
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,309
- There.
- That's too easy.

402
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,606
Come on. Come on, Michael, take it.

403
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,277
Come on. Come on.

404
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,949
Take it.

405
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,120
Take it and run.

406
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,307
Let's think about this.
The keys are accidentally left out.

407
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,518
The door is accidentally left open.

408
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,979
- It's our only shot.
- It's their only shot.

409
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,440
Don't have an excuse to kill us
unless we give it to them.

410
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,650
- How we doing?
- Nothing so far.

411
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,028
<i>- None?</i>
- They're talking, that's all.

412
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:45,032
They haven't bitten in five minutes,
you pull the semi, you tell them it's fixed.

413
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,868
- You release traffic.
- And do what?

414
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,829
You want the rabbit to hop,
you move the carrot, Alex.

415
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,392
You showed.

416
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,770
A gentleman always does.

417
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,856
Where are we going to eat?

418
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,649
Wherever your heart desires.

419
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:24,197
You know, there's just one teensy-tiny
thing I've been meaning to ask.

420
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,200
Anything.

421
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,372
You know, forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

422
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,083
I really shouldn't be doing this.

423
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:41,172
Well, you shouldn't have been doing
a lot of things we did this afternoon...

424
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,258
...but neither of us
has been "smited" down yet.

425
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,512
There she is.

426
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,601
Your cousin'll be pretty surprised to hear
about the money her uncle left her.

427
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,937
You can be certain of it.

428
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,235
Sam, I hope you don't mind me asking,
but, um...

429
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,695
Your hand...

430
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,657
...what happened to it?

431
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,911
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna make you
feel uncomfortable or nothing. I just...

432
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,831
I wanna know you.

433
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,459
I wanna know everything
about you...

434
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,130
...and if this is a part of who you are,
then I want to know how it...

435
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,221
Oh, dear God.

436
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,064
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

437
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,340
Here's what I'm thinking.
You and some of the boys...

438
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,175
...get yourself transferred to ad seg.

439
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,262
We can spend our days playing Scrabble
and watching SportsCenter.

440
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,347
- Look, captain--
- Then in a year and half...

441
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,891
...you recommend me for
those work-release programs.

442
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,894
I can sweat off the rest of my time
heaving hay and getting sun.

443
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,147
- That's why--
- It ain't freedom, but it's close.

444
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,149
Is that why you requested
to be sent here?

445
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,360
Oh, I go anywhere else as a former C.O.,
I'm a dead man.

446
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,989
Here, I got men to watch my back,
get me the finest accommodations--

447
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,576
- They're not putting you in ad seg.
- I don't care where they're putting me...

448
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,037
- ...take me to ad seg.
- It's not like it used to be.

449
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,623
- C.O.'s don't run the game anymore.
- What do you mean?

450
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,459
This new warden. He's cracking down
to prove he's serious...

451
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,919
...about showing
preferential treatment.

452
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,797
He's making an example out of you.

453
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,135
Lou, what the hell is this?

454
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,596
Gen pop.

455
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,574
Welcome home, boss.

456
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,665
Okay, everybody, we're moving out.

457
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,012
Window's closing, Michael,
once the truck moves...

458
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,349
If we run now, we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

459
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,227
We stay, I'm dead within the week.
You're locked up for life.

460
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,730
Or until they find a way to get to you,
and believe me they will.

461
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,732
If we go to prison,
we'll have a few days.

462
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,734
We'll have a chance to contact Sara.

463
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,737
We don't know where Sara is.
Sara may be dead, Michael.

464
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,742
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

465
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,453
- Fighting?
- Yeah.

466
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,377
Get the keys.

467
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,844
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Copy that.

468
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,596
All right, we're on.

469
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,849
<i>Heads up. Hold traffic.</i>

470
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,228
Hold all traffic. Okay.

471
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,031
We have no idea
what's behind that door.

472
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,159
Nope.

473
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,455
- You ready?
- No. You?

474
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,957
No.

475
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,085
Let's go.

476
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,995
Get it open. Kick it open. Go.

477
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,497
All men to the tunnel!

478
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,675
Just pray there's another way
out of here.

479
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,322
This way.

480
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,859
Yeah, they're in,
and they're heading straight for you.

481
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,903
- Armed?
<i>- No.</i>

482
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,364
- Where are you? I'll back you up.
<i>- Keep moving.</i>

483
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:49,410
If they're running from you, they're
running towards me. They're boxed in.

484
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,995
Yeah.

485
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,025
Oh, hold on one sec.

486
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,446
Could I write a check for the food,
because I don't have--

487
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,322
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

488
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,367
They say a good woman is hard to find.

489
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,955
Well, if that's true,
you must be very, very...

490
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,917
...very good.
Don't be frightened.

491
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,088
Teddy's home.

492
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,555
This way.

493
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,388
They're improvising,
heading toward the surface.

494
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,402
- Where to?
- I don't know.

495
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,113
Look, if something happens to us...

496
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,825
...if we get separated, if one of us
doesn't make it, promise you'll find Sara.

497
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,410
- We're gonna make it.
- Just promise me.

498
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,578
