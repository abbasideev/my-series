00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,377
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,713
I'm breaking out. You're gonna
make sure my brother goes with me.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,215
I'm sorry, Henry.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:14,389
This message is for Maricruz. I'll be there
in the airport in Ixtapa waiting for you.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,683
Sucre, down the road,
if you're in trouble...

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,226
...post a note on the message board.

7
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,562
- What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch.net.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,898
That's a bird, right?

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,235
Go pack your things. We're moving.

10
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,697
We will be a family if it kills us.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,740
Pull this off and you're halfway home.

12
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,826
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

13
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,536
Stay away from my family.

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,498
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

15
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:45,169
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, sweetie.

16
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,921
I want for this to be over.

17
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,508
That makes two of us. A question of
looking at whatever your father gave you.

18
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,926
It's just a key.

19
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,263
It's locked in a box inside that cigar club.

20
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:59,517
I'm not a wanted fugitive.
Give me the key. I'll do it.

21
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,561
Wanna take a walk?

22
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,300
Ms. Tancredi.

23
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,218
I need to have a word with you.

24
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,355
- Ms. Tancredi.
- Of course.

25
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,110
Ms. Tancredi? Ma'am?

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,077
- Ms. Tancredi?
- It's time to go.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,498
Ma'am?

28
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,125
They're going out back.

29
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,676
Come on.

30
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,277
Pediatrics, please.

31
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,115
- Hello?
- Cameron.

32
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,326
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing, big guy?

33
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,204
- Good. I'm eating my lunch.
- Oh, how is it?

34
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,705
Pretty disgusting.

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,626
Maybe your mom can bring you
some dinner from home.

36
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,503
- Did you see the doctor today?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,882
He said I could go home this week,
as long as I stay out of the street.

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,718
You're a smart young man.
You know how to cross the street.

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,470
Are you mad at me?

40
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,140
Listen to me.

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:09,397
No one is mad at you,
and this wasn't your fault.

42
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,399
I should've been looking out for you.

43
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,901
You weren't even there.

44
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,403
But I should've been.

45
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,701
Oh, man. Hey, buddy, listen, I gotta go.
But I'll call you back later, okay?

46
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,828
- Okay. Bye.
- Cameron.

47
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,204
I love you.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,583
Cam?

49
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,921
Yeah? What have we got on Franklin?

50
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,590
Nothing new since this morning.

51
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,801
Another witness from the Minnesota
diner robbery gave a positive ID.

52
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,929
Good, because I just landed
in Minneapolis 15 minutes ago.

53
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,390
- Anything else?
- Yeah, the girl, Dede.

54
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,602
Apparently, she's been ill.
Some chronic condition.

55
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,105
Fax Franklin's mug shot to every hospital
in southeastern Minnesota.

56
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,690
Already done. With any luck...

57
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,110
...she'll get sick enough to need one
and he'll show his face.

58
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,281
- You don't have kids, do you, Lang?
- Nope.

59
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,242
Call me when you have something else.

60
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,620
I'll take that.

61
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,586
- We didn't get it.
- What?

62
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,463
And we need to get back in there soon.

63
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,673
Once the Company finds out Sara
was in there...

64
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,134
...it won't belong before
they start wondering why.

65
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,387
Find a spot close to the club and sit tight.
We're gonna take the car.

66
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,806
- Be back in a couple of hours.
- Where you going?

67
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,226
Turns out that maybe there's one member
of that club who can help us.

68
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,145
Who?

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,522
Pope?

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,525
Just a minute.

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,696
Henry.

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,492
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,994
Aside from jumping bail
and evading the authorities?

74
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,915
There's something that you need to hear.
But first, I need to know if you'll listen.

75
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,917
Sara, we've got nothing to discuss.

76
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,337
Please, I need five minutes.
After that, if you want us to, we'll leave.

77
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,838
Who's us?

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,717
- I don't want any trouble.
- Good. Because that's not why we're here.

79
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,301
What the hell are you thinking about...

80
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,554
...waltzing in here?
You're a wanted criminal.

81
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,931
In case you've forgotten,
I dedicated my career...

82
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,226
...my entire life, to keeping people
like you behind bars.

83
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,479
You're talking about guilty people.
My brother is innocent.

84
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,566
- We have the evidence to prove it.
- I don't care. I want you out.

85
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,903
It's in a locked box at the Corona
de Oro Club and you're a member.

86
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,406
- Out.
- Henry, please listen.

87
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,868
Sara, I'm tempted to say
you should've known better.

88
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,661
But after what you did--

89
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,748
My father was looking into
the Burrows case when he was murdered.

90
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,917
This key is the only thing
I could recover from his body.

91
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,767
Where are we going?

92
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:42,109
They're hungry.
We've been driving all day.

93
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,279
Chick-O-Stick.

94
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,115
They need real food.

95
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,494
Soon enough, pumpkin.

96
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,545
Alackaday.

97
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,639
Miscreants. Defilers.

98
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,058
Defacers.

99
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,893
Despoilers.

100
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,071
What is this?

101
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,907
My home.

102
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,298
Oh, no, no, no.

103
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,176
Oh, really, no.

104
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,525
Okay. All right, sweetie,
why don't you sit over here, okay?

105
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:33,197
All right. I'm gonna go over there
and I'm gonna talk to the lady, all right?

106
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,742
So you need anything? You sure?

107
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,452
Okay.

108
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,876
- Yes?
- My daughter, Dede, she's really sick.

109
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,796
She's had this kidney thing
since she was real young.

110
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,464
- It's on the left--
- Where is she?

111
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,299
She's sitting right there.

112
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,969
- Have you been here before?
- No. We're from out of town.

113
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,595
Can I see your insurance card?

114
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,225
No. No, I don't have any insurance.

115
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,144
After I left the Army,
they discontinued my insurance.

116
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,022
Are you a resident of Hennepin County?

117
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,275
Like I said, we're from out of town.

118
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,652
Do you have a driver's license?

119
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,824
Look, I don't have a driver's license,
an insurance card or anything like that.

120
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,493
But I do know the law.
You have to see my little girl.

121
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,331
- I'm gonna go get my supervisor.
- Good.

122
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,921
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your brother.

123
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,092
I trusted you. I took you under my wing.
I treated you like my own son.

124
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,593
I believed you.

125
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,390
Day after day, you lied to me.
What kind of a man does that?

126
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,435
- A desperate one.
- Yeah.

127
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,648
Well, you two made
a big mistake coming here today.

128
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,028
You gave me no choice.
I'm gonna notify the authorities right now.

129
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,031
I'm sorry...

130
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,367
...but I can't let you do that.

131
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,838
- I don't wanna hurt you, Henry.
- Said by the man with the gun.

132
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,548
If it's the way
I can convince you, so be it.

133
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,092
Well, you're not gonna
convince me by doing that.

134
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,888
- I'm not the man you think I am.
- I have a pretty good idea who you are.

135
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,308
If that's true, then you already know
I never wanted to be in Fox River.

136
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,020
I never wanted to meet you, Henry.
I certainly didn't wanna ruin your life.

137
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,022
Yeah? You've done
a pretty damn good job.

138
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,442
You're not saying anything to him
I haven't said myself, Henry.

139
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,236
I've looked into this.
What he's saying to you is true.

140
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,656
I just want my brother's life back.
I want people to know the truth.

141
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,159
I'd give anything for that.
I'd lay down my life.

142
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,245
That's easy for you to say,
standing on that side of the gun.

143
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,669
What if I'm standing on this side?

144
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,386
There are places
that can better serve your needs.

145
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,597
- Look, I know my rights, okay?
- This isn't a primary care facility.

146
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,308
We provide necessary care
in life-threatening situations.

147
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,561
I know. Are you gonna wait until
she's dead before you give her help?

148
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,398
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I'll not argue with you.

149
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,900
This is a hospital,
not a homeless shelter.

150
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,027
A what?

151
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,281
What did you just say to me?

152
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,576
I can't believe you people.

153
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,957
Come on.
The line is a little bit too long, okay?

154
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,626
We'll go somewhere else.

155
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,464
Where are we going?

156
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,467
We gotta find another doctor, sweetie.

157
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,971
My God.

158
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,473
Let's go.

159
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,227
Move!

160
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,735
Hold on, baby.

161
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,455
Franklin!

162
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,666
Thank you for riding
the Minneapolis Auto Train.

163
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,128
- Move out of the way!
- Please disembark quickly.

164
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,923
FBI! Stop! Stop!

165
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,802
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

166
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,181
All right. Look.

167
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,766
- Baby, you gotta get down.
- No.

168
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,352
- No, no, you gotta get down.
- You gotta let him go.

169
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,188
- Get down.
- You gotta let him go.

170
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,772
- Come on.
- No.

171
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,941
The doors will be closing momentarily.

172
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,195
- She's not letting go.
- Don't let her pay for your mistakes.

173
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,698
You hear me?

174
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,174
I could shoot you right now
and not even think twice.

175
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,884
But you won't.

176
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,804
You've spent too much time around
prisons to throw your life away like that.

177
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,265
- What the hell are you trying to pull?
- It's simple.

178
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,602
That's the key to an innocent man's
freedom. Come on, Henry.

179
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,687
We both know there's something
going on here.

180
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,607
Too many people have died.
Look me in the eye.

181
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,610
Tell me you don't believe
there's a cover-up going on right now.

182
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,364
I've got no moral obligations here,
Michael.

183
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,076
As far as I know,
Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

184
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:33,455
Then take a 10-minute drive with me
and we'll find out. That's all I ask.

185
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,875
Henry, you've looked into this before.
You've thought about it.

186
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,961
I have.

187
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,130
And I've come to one conclusion.

188
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,591
This has nothing to do with me.

189
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,718
But I am a man of the law...

190
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,847
...and right now, I've got a convicted felon
standing inside my house.

191
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,978
Well, maybe there's something I can
offer you to make you change your mind.

192
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,741
What do you intend to do with us?

193
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,745
Dumb grease monkey.

194
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,747
You don't deserve minimum wage.

195
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,249
The hell I don't. Working graveyard?

196
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,585
There ain't no man
who deserves more pennies...

197
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,838
...on the dollar per hour
than they got IQ points in his head.

198
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,965
I ain't stupid.

199
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,551
Seems equal stupid as the rest of you.

200
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,681
Seems to run in the genes.

201
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,059
Teddy.

202
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,770
Ten synonyms. Pick a word.

203
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,691
Pick a word.

204
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,152
Destroy.

205
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,990
Ten synonyms for destroy.

206
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,249
Annul.

207
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,254
Mutilate.

208
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,091
Liquidate. Abrogate.

209
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,095
Quell. Ravage. Expunge.

210
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,224
Demolish. Extirpate. Extinguish.

211
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,228
- Whoo! You see that?
- Stupid, my pail.

212
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,605
My boy's gonna be president.

213
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,341
How come you ain't studying?

214
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,219
Because I'm tired.

215
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,054
Because I feel like a circus freak.

216
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:28,148
Well, now...

217
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,944
...it's in your own best interest.

218
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,072
Don't you understand that?

219
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,959
Now, you gonna be president someday.

220
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,216
You mark my words.

221
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,138
Theodore.

222
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,017
Theodore, do you hear me?

223
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,020
What are you gonna do with us?

224
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,249
We're gonna put down some roots.

225
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,878
You wanted me dead, Paul.

226
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,421
Just following orders.

227
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,882
You sent me to the chair
for something I didn't do.

228
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,844
All for your president.
You were willing to do that.

229
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:44,599
- Just following orders.
- Steadman said you loved her.

230
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,227
Steadman was a deranged man
that lived in a locked box.

231
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,272
You don't love someone
that loves power more than life.

232
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,191
- Bitter, huh?
- Am I?

233
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,614
No offense, but you're not capable
of understanding the relationship.

234
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:09,499
Okay, any way you look at it,
there is no light at the end of this tunnel.

235
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:14,170
One way or another, you and I, we die.
Your brother too.

236
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,257
Which is a shame,
given all he's done for you.

237
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,385
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 15 years.

238
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,888
- You think she's better off for it?
- We'll make it.

239
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,474
- What is that, faith?
- Yeah, that's faith.

240
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,476
All I see is a black hole.

241
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:33,481
And sooner or later,
they're gonna suck each one of us into it.

242
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:39,571
But when they come for me, I'm gonna
take as many of them with me as I can.

243
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,409
She must have really
broken your heart, Paul.

244
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,372
President Reynolds attended
a Chicago fundraiser last night...

245
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,083
...as part of hertwo-day stop
in the Windy City.

246
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
Reynolds' popularity continues
to soar in the Midwest...

247
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,839
...with appearances scheduled
in Indianapolis, Detroit...

248
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,925
...and Flint, Michigan later in the week.

249
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,968
At a Democratic fundraiser
in Milwaukee...

250
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,554
Mr. Kim,
Sara Tancredi surfaced in Chicago.

251
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,515
She was spotted at the
Corona de Oro Club about an hour ago.

252
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,017
Corona de Oro Club?

253
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,937
It's a cigar club.
Her father was a member.

254
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,855
He kept a private humidor there.

255
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,780
Get me a jet to Chicago.

256
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,578
Tell me you're not still thinking
he's gonna show.

257
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,873
He's let you down so many times.
You know that.

258
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:18,420
Maybe it's the baby in me that's telling me
that this time, it's gonna be different.

259
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,924
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but he's not gonna show.

260
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,765
Bubble's not burst!

261
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,853
- I got three words for you.
- Yeah?

262
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,896
We gotta run.

263
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,940
We'll see you, Theresa.

264
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,008
- I'm so glad you came.
- You're crazy.

265
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,802
How did they know?

266
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,280
You're certain?

267
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:31,910
- About what's in the box?
- No. But it's all we've got.

268
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,955
Thank you, Henry.

269
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,638
You sure about this?

270
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,848
Nope.

271
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,684
Either way, you still owe me dinner.

272
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,563
Is that so?

273
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,023
Yep.

274
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,819
First week in Fox River, you promised me
if you got out, you'd take me to dinner.

275
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,822
Well, maybe after we wrap this up,
we can stop off...

276
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,533
...and get you a burrito
on the way back to Pope's house.

277
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,243
I don't know what you're used to...

278
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,746
...but anything short of a filet mignon
is not gonna cut it with me.

279
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,792
It's a date.

280
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,052
Give me the phone.

281
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,061
- Hey.
- How'd you pull it off?

282
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,314
- I'll tell you later. Is he in yet?
- Yep.

283
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,483
This shouldn't take more
than a couple minutes.

284
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,278
Any longer than that,
we'll know we've got trouble.

285
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,239
Good afternoon, Mr. Pope.
Right this way.

286
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,491
Thank you.

287
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,205
- Mr. Pope.
- Hey, Warren. How's it going?

288
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,250
You hear what happened this morning?
Sara Tancredi came in.

289
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,586
Yeah, so I heard.

290
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,505
Well, next time,
don't let her get away.

291
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,465
Thanks.

292
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,691
Excuse me. You mind if I borrow
your computer for a moment?

293
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,444
- No problem.
- Thanks.

294
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,166
Pitch in, chitlins.

295
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,919
We can't do this. We can't live here.

296
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:33,341
Of course, not like this. We gonna clean.
We are cleaning. We gonna rebuild.

297
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,178
You can't do this to them. Look at them.

298
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,186
You all mind coming along here
for a minute?

299
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,608
Come on. I think we're past me waving
that gun around, don't you think?

300
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,361
In here. Now, come on.

301
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,615
- What are you doing?
- Nothing is gonna happen to them, Susan.

302
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,035
Suzy Q.,
do you think I'd bring you here...

303
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,330
...to so sacred a place to me as this,
if I meant you ill?

304
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,582
Look at me!

305
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,505
I am not the animal
you think you see before you.

306
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,218
I am the laws of karma
all come down wrong.

307
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,512
- Don't you understand?
- I don't.

308
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:28,438
What I'm trying to say...

309
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,733
...is that I am the sin of my father.

310
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,448
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because I love you.

311
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,701
Because I want you to understand me.

312
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,955
I am the last in the line of Bagwells.

313
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,958
The tail end of a corrupted breed.

314
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:54,297
The earth, thank God,
shall see no more of our generations.

315
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:09,270
I cannot procreate, Susan.

316
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,817
And yet there's something in that
that gives me great hope.

317
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,153
No more Bagwells shall roam this planet.

318
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,405
Not with that vile blood in their veins.

319
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:23,368
All I wanna do is end that bloodline,
extirpate it...

320
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,080
...and start another afresh.

321
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,998
- A new family.
- Oh, Teddy.

322
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,584
Those children are my salvation.

323
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,088
My chance to make this world
a better place.

324
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,010
I will be good, Susan.

325
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,055
I will love them. I will love you.

326
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,684
I will take communion,
be baptized under a truer light.

327
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:55,817
All I ask is that you love me back,
just a little.

328
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,363
Or learn to do so in time.

329
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,074
Can you do that, Susan?

330
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:17,839
I can't.

331
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,310
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,991
Please. Please.

333
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,369
Teddy, please. Oh, God.

334
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,083
Teddy.

335
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,421
Teddy, please.

336
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,010
Teddy, I'm sorry.

337
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,762
I can do it, I can do it...

338
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,910
- Where are we?
- At the doctor's office, sweetie.

339
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,289
Hello? Hello.
I have an emergency in here.

340
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,211
Hello?

341
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,388
Hello.

342
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,603
- Hey, you the doctor?
- You need to wait your turn.

343
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,064
No, it is my turn.
This is an emergency right here.

344
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:02,818
I need you to look at my daughter, okay?
Now, she's not feeling too good.

345
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,112
Please.

346
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,408
Here, sweetie. Hold on.

347
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,369
I'm sorry.

348
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,580
Hey, look,
this is all the money I got, okay?

349
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,166
That's $400.

350
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,839
Please look at my daughter.

351
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:30,012
- What's the matter with her?
- She has a kidney disease. PKD.

352
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,432
Normally, we have it under control,
but I don't like what I'm seeing now.

353
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,519
She's having stomach hurts, okay,
she's always hot.

354
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,604
- How's her appetite?
- It's gone.

355
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,316
- She's always tired. Ain't that right, baby?
- All right.

356
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,653
Hop up here.

357
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,863
Thank you.

358
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,327
Okay, he just wants to take
a good look at you, okay?

359
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:57,331
- I may need to run a few tests.
- Hey, just do what you have to do, man.

360
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,876
I'm gonna be right here, okay, baby?

361
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,795
Okay.

362
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,011
- Yeah?
- What's going on now?

363
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,554
He's still in there.

364
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,472
This is taking too long.

365
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,892
Wait, wait, wait. Here he comes.

366
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,736
- What's happening?
- We got company.

367
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,904
Hello, Henry.

368
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,209
- Didn't know you were a cigar man.
- Who are you?

369
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,797
A friend. A colleague, in fact.
We're both in law enforcement.

370
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,091
I'm not anymore.

371
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,678
That's right. You're retired.

372
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,932
- You know that guy?
- Yeah.

373
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:04,106
Looks like the lifestyle's treating you well.
Socializing over Cubans and cognac.

374
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,737
But that's not what you were doing,
is it?

375
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,449
Henry?

376
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,286
You don't mind if I ask you
to empty your pockets?

377
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,706
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I'm not gonna play any games, Henry.

378
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,543
We both know why you came here today.

379
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,465
I suggest you get out of my way,
young man.

380
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,886
I can't do that.

381
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,812
Unless you'd like to cause serious trouble
for yourself and your family...

382
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,148
...I advise you to hand over
whatever it is you found.

383
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,902
Now.

384
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,573
Michael--

385
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,756
Get in!

386
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,277
Let's go! Linc!

387
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,874
Sara!

388
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,195
It's okay, it's okay. Easy, easy.
It's okay, it's okay.

389
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,948
Ma'am, you all right?

390
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,242
I don't understand.

391
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,079
We got a call. Someone said
there was a hostage situation here.

392
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,584
No one knew we were here.

393
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,525
Are you okay? Okay.

394
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,944
So, what's going on?

395
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,613
I'm afraid your daughter
shows signs of renal failure.

396
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,784
Has she ever had hemodialysis?

397
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:06,789
No. Hemo--? No, no.
This has never really gone that far.

398
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,794
What, are you planning
on doing it right here?

399
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,922
We're not set up for it. Neither is she.

400
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:19,385
But there is a county dialysis clinic
a few blocks away.

401
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:23,639
But we're going to have
to place a catheter in her neck...

402
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,474
...so she can be examined.

403
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,978
Hold still, sweetie. This'll be a little cold.

404
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,230
It's okay, baby.

405
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,990
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?

406
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,076
It's a trocar.
It's used for placing the catheter.

407
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,328
Lie down, honey.

408
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:55,713
- Do we really have to go this far?
- Look...

409
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,174
I'm doing the best I can here.
But you gotta understand something.

410
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,801
Your daughter is sick.

411
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,597
Now, this may look like
a desperate measure because it is.

412
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,646
This is gonna hurt a little bit, sweetie.

413
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,648
Stop! Stop.

414
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,359
Come on, baby.

415
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,821
Come on, baby. I can't do this.

416
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,052
What's going on?

417
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,220
I made a deal with Pope.

418
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,394
You made a deal with Pope?
What kind of deal?

419
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:56,482
If he came with us,
and if we got what we needed...

420
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,734
...I said I'd turn myself in.

421
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,071
What? We don't even know
what this thing is.

422
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,074
It could be nothing, Michael.
You know about this?

423
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,242
Not until it came out of his mouth.

424
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,745
It was the only thing I could think of.

425
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:13,916
You two can still finish this.
You'll just have to do it without me.

426
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,087
I'm not gonna let you do this, Michael.
There's no coming back from this.

427
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,634
- Now, look.
- What's the holdup?

428
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,094
Your brother's right.

429
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:29,306
I wouldn't count on the courts
to show you any leniency in this.

430
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,727
That doesn't matter.
I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

431
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,313
You already did.

432
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,110
I listened to this.
You have something here.

433
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:45,280
There are gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

434
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,449
- Listen, Henry--
- I'd go now, if I were you.

435
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,619
And don't consider this forgiveness.

436
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,665
In fact, I'm about 10 seconds away
from changing my mind.

437
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,876
Thank you.

438
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,144
Okay.

439
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,733
Here, let's...

440
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,487
Let's tuck you in, all right? Okay?

441
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,326
Come on, let's go.

442
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:43,756
Listen, let's just sit
for a little bit longer, okay?

443
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,178
We're gonna go in a little bit, okay?

444
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,908
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

445
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,535
I love you so much.

446
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,288
I'm so sorry.

447
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm so sorry, baby.

448
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,896
- Yeah?
- I got a call for you.

449
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,649
I'll call back.
I just heard from some clinic up north.

450
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,151
They had contact with Franklin
half an hour ago.

451
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,653
I think you want to take this.

452
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,573
Put it through.

453
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,034
Yeah? Mahone.

454
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,538
- Is this the man in charge?
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:04,211
My name is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

456
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,549
And I wanna turn myself in.

457
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,592
But I got one condition.

458
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,428
My wife, well, she goes free.

459
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,223
My little daughter, she needs her mother.

460
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,019
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

461
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,108
What if I got something you need?

462
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,484
Your wife was released an hour ago.
She'll be here soon.

463
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,487
Promise me that she will be okay.

464
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,747
Just hold up your end of the deal.

465
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,709
I will.

466
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,506
I'll get you Scofield.

467
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,528
Here we go.

468
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,037
You think it's a conversation?

469
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,580
One they don't want us to hear.

470
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,710
- You ready?
- Let's do it.
