1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,127
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,380
There's something about this guy.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,548
He knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,010
It's a matter of time before
he finds out about the money in Utah...

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,347
...and our way into Mexico, everything.

6
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,106
You can have an attorney present
during questioning.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,401
Carolyn, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,236
I did it, Dad.

9
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,904
Just do as you're told.

10
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,825
Otherwise, there will be consequences
that will affect us all.

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,660
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

12
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:41,374
When I told him I was staying in a hotel
with a guy that I maybe sort of liked...

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,584
...he lost it.

14
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,255
- Why're you here? Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me.

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,675
- Just tell me where she is.
- Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

16
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,428
I was trying to tell you
the wedding is in Vegas.

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,057
- So which one of them it was it?
- Might be Scofield.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,226
Probably gonna find his brother
in there too.

19
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,231
- Where to, sir?
- Utah.

20
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,241
Authorities
<i>in Illinois issued an update...</i>

21
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,203
<i>...on the escaped convicts known,</i>
<i>until now, as the Fox River Eight.</i>

22
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,247
<i>Chicago mob boss John Abruzzi...</i>

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,500
<i>...was gunned down outside</i>
<i>a Washington, D.C. motel last night...</i>

24
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,628
<i>...after investigators received</i>
<i>a tip from an informant.</i>

25
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,632
<i>The other seven escapees are still at large</i>
<i>and considered dangerous.</i>

26
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:33,718
<i>A Florida man wanted in--</i>

27
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,431
I didn't think Abruzzi'd
be the first to eat it.

28
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,267
I have a feeling
we're in for lots of surprises.

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,605
They said seven are still out there.
So much for faking our deaths.

30
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,483
I bought us some time.
That's what counts.

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,696
- How much further?
- Seventy, 80 miles.

32
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,532
Means we should be hitting
Double-K Ranch by this afternoon.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,993
We could keep driving,
pick up L.J. and hit Panama.

34
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,122
We can't hit Panama. We can't do
anything without the money.

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,501
We need to find Charles' stash.

36
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,755
I know some other guys
who are thinking the same thing.

37
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:18,679
The money is buried under a silo
at the Double-K Ranch...

38
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:24,352
...just outside of Tooele, Utah.
There's $5 million there.

39
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,118
Tickets.

40
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,745
Oh.

41
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,874
You know, when I was in Cheyenne,
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.

42
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,878
It tore in half, and I have no idea
what happened to the other part.

43
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,881
- They didn't issue you a replacement?
- No.

44
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,133
The young lady,
I think her name was Sherry...

45
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,637
...she actually said that this half was
okay because the barcode was on it.

46
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,681
Well, you really need the whole ticket.

47
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,725
This is exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

48
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,727
She said everything
would be fine because--

49
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,271
That's okay. It'll do for now.

50
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,566
But make sure you ask for a replacement
when you get to Provo.

51
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,235
I definitely will. Thank you.

52
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,197
- It's always something, huh?
- Oh, God, I know.

53
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,128
I don't wanna go home.

54
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,590
I wish we could keep driving.

55
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,759
I don't think your pops
will be down for that.

56
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,429
Wouldn't it be fun?

57
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,975
We could go to Hawaii.

58
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,604
- No, you can't drive to Hawaii.
- I know.

59
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,105
I know.

60
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,858
I'm just saying, I wish.

61
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,865
- No, don't get it. They'll leave.
- Just let me see who it is.

62
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,581
It's a cop.

63
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,458
No, no, no.

64
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,465
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Have you happened to see this person?

65
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,755
Last night, we got a few phone calls
that he was spotted in the area.

66
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,173
So we're going door to door.

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,926
Why are you looking for him?

68
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,804
He escaped from prison
in Illinois a couple of days ago.

69
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,722
Have you seen him?

70
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,104
No.

71
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,855
He doesn't look familiar.

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,358
Are you sure?

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,486
Yeah, I'm sure.

74
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,657
All right. Thanks for your time.

75
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,707
Whoa, whoa.

76
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,210
This ain't--
This is not what you think, all right?

77
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:42,049
Look, trust me. Just listen, okay?

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,556
All I did was steal a baseball card, okay?
I'm not like those other fools up in there.

79
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,936
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

80
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,147
I'm gonna leave my keys right here.

81
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,234
And when I come back,
my car will be gone.

82
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,615
I'm sure in a few hours,
they'll find it somewhere...

83
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,576
...abandoned.

84
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,082
Wait, wait.

85
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,840
I wish it could be different.

86
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,510
I have to go.

87
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,950
- Tooele.
- I think it's "Tooele."

88
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,620
- Hell of a town.
- Small is good.

89
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,538
Means the ranch'll be easier to find.

90
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,957
All we gotta do is get that money...

91
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,461
- ...and be out of here by nightfall.
- Nice.

92
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,068
Oh, sir. Soil tests came back
from Scofield's crash.

93
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:28,072
Not that you need any more proof, but
he really went out of his way this time.

94
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,241
What else do you have?

95
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,453
A man was assaulted in Nebraska by a
hitchhiker matching Bagwell's description.

96
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,082
He was headed west on the I-80.
Omaha's putting together a photo lineup.

97
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,834
What do you have on Scofield?

98
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,003
What does anybody have on Scofield?

99
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,676
Uh, I've got some results from his hard
drive. The one recovered from the river.

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,306
We were able to use the sector editor
to restore the master boot. So from that--

101
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,642
I don't care how you did it.
What do you have?

102
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,481
More than half the contents of the buffer.
About 60 percent.

103
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,532
- It looks pretty random.
- Print it up, all of it. I want it on my desk.

104
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,705
Well, guess what.

105
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,040
No listing for a Double-K Ranch.

106
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,878
Excuse me. You know where
I might find the Double-K Ranch?

107
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,463
- What'd you call it?
- Double-K Ranch.

108
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,632
- No.
- You from around here?

109
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,217
Yeah. Born and raised.

110
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,178
There's no double nothing.

111
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,555
Great. Thank you.

112
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,393
Looks like Westmoreland spent his
last breath blowing smoke up your ass.

113
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,895
There's one way to find out.

114
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,731
The county keeps property records.

115
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,526
Every plot is mapped out
with dimensions. It's public record.

116
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,405
But if there
is a tax assessor's office here...

117
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,532
...it's gonna be in there.

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,993
In the municipal building.

119
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,330
Lot of cops in there, Michael.

120
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,878
- Dispatch.
- Someone...

121
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,632
<i>Someone stole my car this morning.</i>
<i>I'm at the Lotus Motel off Interstate 80.</i>

122
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:14,094
<i>OFFICER. Did you see who took it?</i>
<i>DEBRA.. No. I went out for a walk.</i>

123
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,722
<i>- And when I came back, it was gone.</i>
- This morning?

124
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,851
<i>- OFFICER. Why didn't you call before?</i>
- I don'tknow.

125
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,995
- Mr. Kellerman.
- Mr. Kim.

126
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,833
- Surprised to see you in Chicago.
- Just looking for updates.

127
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,459
Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

128
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,672
- Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,301
She's in contact with Scofield.
I was there when he called yesterday.

130
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,679
We stay with her, she takes us
right to him, he takes us to Burrows.

131
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,849
All right.

132
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,767
- If you're that confident.
- I am.

133
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,106
- I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president directly.

134
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,359
I'll contact her.

135
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,696
Keep me posted.

136
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,725
<i>If you wanna restore dignity,</i>
<i>you need to take action.</i>

137
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,229
<i>Making amends requires much more</i>
<i>than saying, "I'm sorry."</i>

138
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,732
It means learning to change.

139
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,526
The apology's just the first step.

140
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,155
The most important thing
is that you display honesty...

141
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:43,077
...courage and compassion
when you extend your apologies.

142
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,246
You need to earn your forgiveness.

143
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,374
We'll talk about it more on Friday.

144
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,933
- I got a great idea.
- What's that?

145
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,812
Since you are such a fan of lame,
store-bought blueberry pie...

146
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,274
...I'm gonna bake you
a real pie of your choice tonight.

147
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,071
I can't.

148
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,950
I really don't need to be seeing anyone
right now who isn't my therapist.

149
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,287
I've been a hermit lately too.

150
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,249
My partner Daniel's away on business.

151
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,459
I've been sitting around
every night by myself.

152
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,421
Kind of pathetic.

153
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,632
I'm so sorry. I thought you meant...

154
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,968
Um...

155
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,386
I thought...

156
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,140
- The pie...
- Oh, no.

157
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,270
- No, I was really talking about--
- Pie?

158
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,857
Yeah, actual blueberries. Like we'd make
pie and watch FriedGreen Tomatoes.

159
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,610
- I get it. I get it.
- I'm the best ex-junkie cook in this town.

160
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,238
Thank you. I just--
I gotta clean my apartment.

161
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,824
It's disgusting.
I realize that sounds like an excuse.

162
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,951
- It's not.
- No, no, no, I get it.

163
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,495
You do what you gotta do.

164
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,999
Have a good night.

165
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,210
You deliver?

166
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,221
Next batch.

167
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,730
Ow.

168
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,670
Just put it on the desk.

169
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,884
- Any of this stuff mean anything?
- I don't know. Ask me later.

170
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,385
Is he a genius or a whackjob?

171
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,679
We answered that
when we assigned 100 agents.

172
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,848
So why don't you go
get me the rest of it?

173
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,433
Does that work for you?

174
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,343
Alackaday.

175
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,762
I just found me an in-betweener.

176
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,934
- Where you going in such a hurry?
- None of your beeswax, yo.

177
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,310
I know where.

178
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,480
The same place as every other man
that was in that room that night.

179
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:03,735
They all coming around here for a big
family reunion at the Ku Klux Ranch.

180
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,154
If they ain't here already.

181
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,366
There ain't no fool in this town
ever heard of the Double-K Ranch.

182
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,994
It seems like you been misinformed.
There is a Double-K.

183
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,164
It's just a matter of who gets there first.
The stars are gonna collide in Tooele.

184
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,250
You'll need me on your side.

185
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,169
This ain't Fox River, all right?
I don't need any--

186
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,383
As you can see...

187
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,176
...I need you.

188
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,140
Get your grubby paws off me, you freak.

189
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,350
I ain't your ditch digger.

190
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,352
I don't need nothing from you.

191
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,937
I don't need nothing.

192
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,856
You might.

193
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,319
If a man knew where he was
supposed to be looking...

194
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,375
<i>Hi.</i>

195
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,212
Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

196
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,883
Avila. No? Thanks.

197
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,895
Hi. Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

198
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,397
Avila.

199
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,233
Delgado.

200
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,902
Really?

201
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,446
When?

202
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,668
Stay calm. We'll be out of here
in 10 minutes.

203
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,754
One at a time.

204
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,173
Clear. Back up.

205
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,763
You wearing a watch?

206
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,432
Yeah.

207
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,612
Nice day.

208
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,199
Thanks.

209
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:28,088
This is exactly what we need.
It's a map of every parcel of land.

210
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,425
Topography, buildings, everything.

211
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,222
Karl Kokosing. Double-K.

212
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,142
I don't like the way
this guy's looking at us.

213
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,278
Twelve-thirteen.

214
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,824
Where's 1213?

215
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:06,334
- Seifert. I need to speak with you.
- Come on, man. We gotta roll now.

216
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,797
- Hey, Seifert.
- Come on. You got the map?

217
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,928
No.

218
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,473
Someone else does.

219
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,903
Someone got here before us.
It's the only explanation.

220
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,786
Son of a bitch is still alive.

221
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,124
- Hey, pretty.
- What the--?

222
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,752
What you gonna do, scream?

223
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,380
How the hell are you still breathing?

224
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,508
What the hell'd you do to your hand?

225
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,054
Easy, easy.

226
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,972
I recently had some work done.

227
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,891
Where's the map?

228
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,562
Easy, easy, easy. I don't have it.

229
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,690
- Well, where is it?
- I'm telling you, I don't have it.

230
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,361
- Don't have it, huh?
- You were there. We saw you.

231
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,072
It was gone. Why don't you keep
your pooch away from me?

232
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,407
I'll tell you everything I know.

233
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,830
It's the kid. He has it.

234
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,040
I saw him this morning.

235
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,043
I needed some help.
We made a deal, all right?

236
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,755
He said that he would dig.
I told him where we could get a map at.

237
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,844
What kid?

238
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,442
The best thing to do is nothing.

239
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,571
That's how I'll get the U.S. Senate
to confirm my vice-presidency?

240
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,614
- Do nothing?
- Shows them you can do the job.

241
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,785
Wait a minute. It's my daughter.

242
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,539
Sir, we need to talk about your daughter.

243
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,207
What about her?

244
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,002
Well, the media
is all over this Fox River situation.

245
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,505
We think it would be best
if you could distance yourself from her--

246
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,217
If I hear this one more time...
I paid her bail. I walked away.

247
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,636
I have distanced myself.

248
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,100
Give me a minute.

249
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,980
Hey, Dad, it's me.

250
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,817
When you get a chance, I really need
to talk to you about some things.

251
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,279
Actually, a lot of things.

252
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,324
The most important one is that...

253
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,160
...I owe you an apology.

254
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,955
I realize that I've made things
difficult for you lately.

255
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,165
Um...

256
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,630
And I wanna take responsibility for that.
Um...

257
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,799
Call me back. Bye.

258
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,179
- Hi. I know I'm early, but I brought dinner.
- Come on in.

259
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,932
- You're not a vegetarian, are you?
- No.

260
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,184
Just shut that behind you.

261
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,906
- Do you mind if I check my e-mail?
- No, not at all. Here.

262
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,367
- You're so kind. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

263
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,893
- Do you happen to have a pen handy?
- Yeah.

264
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,229
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

265
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,690
No, look, I have a little pencil and pad.

266
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,400
Thank you.

267
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,909
- Sir. Sir.
- Yeah?

268
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,494
No Sherry in Cheyenne.

269
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,830
Your ticket is not valid for travel.

270
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,333
Oh, well, hold on, now.
That can't be right. That can't be right.

271
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,585
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

272
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,757
All right, now, listen, brother,
I'm gonna give it to you straight up.

273
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,759
Seriously, I don't-- I'm broke, okay?

274
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,761
Now, that's the truth.

275
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,431
Now, I just ran into some trouble
a while back.

276
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,352
I'm just trying to pull it all together now.
You understand?

277
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,439
Well, you can tell that to the authorities
in about five minutes.

278
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,108
Come on, brother,
we don't have to get the authorities--

279
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,776
It's too late.

280
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,903
They're already waiting at the next stop.

281
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,407
These guys here are gonna sit with you
until we stop.

282
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,454
I understand. I understand.

283
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,546
- Hey!
- Come here.

284
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,631
- Sir.
- Hey, you can't go in there.

285
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,386
Oh, my goodness.

286
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,655
Okay, we've got a confirmed sighting
on Franklin.

287
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,450
He jumped out of a moving train
in Preston, Idaho.

288
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:35,497
What is a black man from Chicago
doing in ldaho? He's gotta be lost.

289
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,707
Franklin's in Preston,
Bagwell's in Nebraska.

290
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,126
Both men have never been
across the Mississippi.

291
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,504
Visiting friends and family?
I don't think so.

292
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,173
And not south of the border.

293
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:50,678
They're due west,
and we need to know why.

294
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,307
Out.

295
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,812
- What's going on?
- Where'd you say Tweener was headed?

296
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,689
Up on the main drag.
He's supposed to find a shovel.

297
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,864
- In.
- No.

298
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,534
- No, no, no.
- In.

299
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,042
You're coming back, right?
You're coming back?

300
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,794
- Yep.
- Hey, you guys.

301
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,672
Hey.

302
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,591
Come on, man. I'm boiling up in here.

303
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,481
I was on my ATV and I was hauling ass.
I was right on her tail.

304
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,942
I pulled out my gun and... that bitch
treed herself.

305
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,902
And I brought her down in one shot.

306
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,238
- What'd she weigh?
- At least a hunny.

307
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,615
- Maybe 110.
- Come see us if you want.

308
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,244
- It's gonna be a good time.
- Yeah, I just might do that.

309
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,712
Hey, now. What you digging?

310
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,089
Uh...

311
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,092
Some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

312
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,762
I got a bigger one in the back
if you're going deep.

313
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,182
No, this'll do.

314
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,769
Damn it if I don't know you
from somewhere.

315
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,438
Maybe I know your grandpa.

316
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,900
Doubt it, man.
He moved here like a month ago so...

317
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,943
What's his name?

318
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,573
His name's Grandpa, all right?
Can you just ring this up?

319
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,576
- I gotta get out of here.
- Sure thing, fella.

320
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,952
I'll ring it up.

321
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,412
I'll ring it right now.

322
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,585
I know where I've seen you. On TV.

323
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,296
You're one of them Fox River boys.

324
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,280
- You got it wrong, man.
- No, I think I got it right.

325
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,825
We're closed.

326
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,045
Sorry, bud.

327
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,547
We're closing up early today.

328
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,302
Hey, hold on. Stay right there.

329
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,147
You're going down just like your buddy,
you son of a bitch.

330
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,612
Where's the kid?

331
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,783
- Where's the kid?
- He's back here.

332
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,535
Get up.

333
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,040
Come on, tough guy.

334
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,959
Let's go.

335
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,777
All right.

336
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,419
Maricruz? Baby, open up.

337
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,588
Shh, shh.

338
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,631
It's me. It's me, okay?

339
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,303
Fernando, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

340
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,889
I know. Where's your sister?
I need to see her.

341
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,350
She's getting her picture taken
with my mom and dad.

342
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,186
- The wedding's at 2:30.
- I need to see her now.

343
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,647
- You have to go.
- She's the mother of my kid, Theresa.

344
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,274
Please.

345
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,652
You don't want her
to marry Hector, do you? Do you?

346
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,575
I'll go see if I can go get her.

347
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,620
- Wait in here.
- Okay.

348
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,178
- Lance, I got a question for you.
- Yes?

349
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,889
You know who I am?

350
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,434
Uh...

351
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,312
I happened to see the news
last night, yes.

352
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,317
Hey, I don't care.
I've got some skeletons in my closet too.

353
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,528
One of whom wears a dress.

354
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,074
Thank you.
I appreciate your lack of judgment.

355
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,535
From what I can tell,
you didn't do anything wrong.

356
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,788
But it's none of my business,
and you don't need to talk about it.

357
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,790
The whole thing just...

358
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,670
I never meant for it to happen.

359
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,550
Okay, you do not need
to answer this question.

360
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,221
- Hm?
- But were you and that guy, like...?

361
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,727
You're right, I don't wanna talk about it.

362
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,567
- You're done?
- Yeah.

363
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,028
Does it worry you that he's out there?

364
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,117
Give me one second.

365
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,588
- Dad.
- Sara, hi.

366
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,715
I got your message.

367
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,383
Please, come in.

368
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,098
Lance, this is my father, Frank.

369
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,309
- How do you do?
- Dad, this is Lance.

370
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,936
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
And I voted for you.

371
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,438
Thank you. I appreciate that.

372
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,941
- Sara, I can take off.
- No need.

373
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,776
Only take a minute.

374
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,404
You step into my office.
And you make yourself at home.

375
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,780
Sure.

376
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,541
So...

377
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:41,088
So in my program, we've been talking
a lot about making amends.

378
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,675
And I've been thinking a lot about...

379
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,263
About some of the choices
I've made lately.

380
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,265
And I know that that affects you.

381
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,857
And I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

382
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,110
- Well, you don't have to say you're sorry.
- Yeah, I do.

383
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,782
And it must be hard to understand
why I did it.

384
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,325
Um...

385
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:14,455
I had no idea that I was putting
these guys back out on the street.

386
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,458
I thought I was saving the life
of an innocent man.

387
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,962
And I know that you didn't read
the information I gave you...

388
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,423
...on Lincoln Burrows,
but he is innocent...

389
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,343
...and a lot of the people
involved right now are dead.

390
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:36,686
I'm sorry. This isn't why I called you.

391
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,022
I'm fine.

392
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,817
But I'm scared.

393
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,612
Sara.

394
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,448
I'm gonna help you through this.

395
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,201
We're gonna get through this together.

396
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,706
- Thank you.
- I promise.

397
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,669
- Kellerman.
- We ran that trace.

398
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,380
- What'd you get?
<i>- The line is disconnected.</i>

399
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,550
- And whose was it?
<i>- Apparently no one.</i>

400
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:11,387
- What does that mean?
<i>- It's been out of service for 17 years.</i>

401
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,520
Fernando.

402
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,357
- Where is she?
- Now, calm down. Calm down.

403
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,526
She's gonna come down and talk to you.

404
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,571
She's on her way down right now.

405
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,159
You and I got history. We're family.

406
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,537
Out of respect for that,
I'm gonna let her make her own decision.

407
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,665
- I'm not leaving without her.
- That's for Maricruz to decide.

408
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,210
- You've been filling her head with crap.
- She's a smart girl.

409
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,464
I personally don't think she's gonna
wanna live her life on the run.

410
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,549
- We'll see.
- You know she doesn't love you.

411
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,886
- I don't wanna get into that right now.
- You're not raising my kid.

412
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,228
That don't sound good, cuz.

413
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,861
- Maricruz? Baby? Where is she?
- You have to go.

414
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,738
- Where is she?
- Please. They're coming.

415
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,116
Did you tell her I was here? Did you?

416
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,996
Maricruz.

417
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,654
Mahone.

418
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,323
I'll be right down.

419
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,998
- Mr. Mahone.
- Where are they?

420
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,419
I had a hard time getting my hands
on these. Be easier to go to a doctor.

421
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,337
You need something to calm your nerves.

422
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,173
Doctors take notes.
That's why I have a deal with you.

423
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,093
The way things have been going,
I thought our deal was over.

424
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,304
- You don't ask me about Shales no more.
- That part is over.

425
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,598
I no longer need
an informant on the case.

426
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,727
I thought that's all you cared about,
was finding him.

427
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,771
- Can't get them all.
- I can keep an ear out on the street--

428
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:30,025
Midazolam, 1500 milligrams every
30 days. That's all I want from you.

429
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,653
We understand each other?

430
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,907
You gonna pay me for it?

431
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,037
Wait there.

432
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,044
- What are you doing here?
- We had to come for you.

433
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,797
- How'd you know?
- T-Bag.

434
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,215
Hand over the map.

435
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,675
- What?
- The map.

436
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,302
Hand it over.

437
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,555
He told you I had it?

438
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,991
We are gonna sort this out right now.

439
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,000
Tell me that's not what I know it is.

440
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,795
It is. But don't worry.

441
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,423
Before I destroyed it, I committed it
to my photographic memory.

442
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,343
Coming from a compulsive liar,
I find that hard to believe.

443
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:40,888
I'd have tattooed it to my body,
but I didn't have the time.

444
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:45,017
Whenever you strip-search a lifer,
you should always check his coin purse.

445
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,728
Tell us where the money is.

446
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,856
Now, let's not dissolve
into threats, all right?

447
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,443
I'll take the high road here. Suggest
a mutually beneficial arrangement.

448
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,278
I have the information.

449
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,072
You have the manual requirements...

450
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,116
...necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

451
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,327
- We're partners.
- And why is that?

452
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,372
Because as of this moment,
I'm your map.

453
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,797
So then, yo, we split it four ways, right?

454
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,424
Wrong. Get in.

455
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,469
- Whoa, whoa.
- You're not worth 1.5.

456
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,972
- Get in.
- Okay.

457
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,414
Excuse me. Can I help you?

458
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,002
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah.

459
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,503
Ooh.

460
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,298
It's hot.

461
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,553
I was really wondering how much
you're selling your RV for.

462
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,140
- Probably out of your price range.
- Come on. Give me a shot.

463
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,267
Forty thousand dollars.

464
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,941
Look, I tell you what.

465
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,027
I'll be back in a couple of days, okay?

466
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,654
I can't hold it for you.

467
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,865
I said I'll be back.

468
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,283
With cash.

469
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,762
Nice bike.

470
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,357
<i>The wedding's at 2:30, Fernando.</i>

471
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,320
We just got confirmation
on Fernando Sucre.

472
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,238
He was in Las Vegas around 2.

473
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,990
Then a gas station attendant...

474
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:10,496
...spotted a guy on a bike matching
his description in Mesquite...

475
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,248
...an hour later.

476
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,293
Out west. Just like Bagwell and Franklin.

477
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,920
Yeah, but he was heading east...

478
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,381
...and Bagwell's in Nebraska
on I-80 heading west...

479
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,926
...and Franklin's train was heading west,
but he jumped off to the...

480
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,268
- You know D.B. Cooper?
- Yeah, the hijacker.

481
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,854
- But he was never found.
- But he's gotta be somewhere.

482
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:40,067
Someone hijacked that plane in Portland,
jumped out over the Pacific Northwest...

483
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,238
...and someone was arrested
two days later in Bisbee, Arizona.

484
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,864
- Not the same guy.
- Same guy.

485
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,033
Same guy who was treated
for a broken knee...

486
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,494
...at a free clinic
somewhere around Salt Lake City.

487
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,706
Same guy whose Nova blew a head
gasket 10 miles short of the border.

488
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,792
Same guy who almost got away
with a stolen car...

489
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,877
...but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.

490
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,671
Vehicular manslaughter.

491
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,591
Arrested and booked
as Charles Westmoreland.

492
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,219
But he didn't have the money on him.

493
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,263
Which means...

494
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,473
...he got rid of it
somewhere along the way.

495
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:15,561
- This is fact? You figured all this out?
- No, Scofield did.

496
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,397
That's why he was bringing the old man.
The money's in Utah.

497
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,941
And they're all going to get it.

498
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,990
You know, in Thailand,
they got a black market...

499
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,160
...where you can get any surgery
you need, even a hand transplant.

500
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,661
You're sick, you know that?

501
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,330
Keep going.
The turnoff's just up here somewhere.

502
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,125
Before or after Sheep Road?

503
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,003
What's the matter? Did you forget?

504
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,006
How could I forget a road called Sheep?
It's after.

505
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,967
Don't you feel all warm inside
now that we're working together?

506
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,596
We aren't working together.
You're just here to lend a hand.

507
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:55,267
Wait, wait, slow down. That was it.
That little bitty road right back there.

508
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,708
How far is it from here?

509
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,378
A quarter mile,
if I remember the scale properly.

510
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,214
Let's start walking.

511
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,154
- Frank?
- Yeah, I'm almost ready.

512
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,032
- What time did you say the flight was?
- Eight.

513
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,370
Listen, I hope you get this nomination
more than anyone, but be prepared.

514
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,247
This Burrows thing may steamroll.

515
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,751
- Well, we'll wait it out, just like you said.
- Problem is too many headlines.

516
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,920
His lawyer, Nick Savrinn, is already dead.

517
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,131
His kid's awaiting trial
for double homicide...

518
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,842
...and now his lead counsel
is classified as missing.

519
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,594
Well, is she missing or is she dead?

520
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,181
I just thought you should know
before you go to Washington.

521
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,101
Bruce, is there something
connecting all of this?

522
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,729
It's probably best you don't ask
a whole lot of questions.

523
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,867
Where now?

524
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,662
Right up there.

525
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,915
The hill borders the property.

526
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,834
The K.K. is on the other side.

527
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,461
First thing I'm gonna do
with the money:

528
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,006
- Buy new shoes.
- Second thing, tacos.

529
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,675
Third thing, ice-cold beer.

530
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,345
Fourth thing, a little toothpaste.

531
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,306
Dang!

532
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,364
- Mahone.
<i>- Your car's out front, sir.</i>

533
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:19,203
<i>- The flight to Utah leaves in an hour.</i>
- I'll be there. Thank you.

534
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,564
Ninth thing, a shower.

535
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:52,653
- Tenth thing, a good night's sleep.
- A nice hotel. Clean sheets.

536
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:57,199
- Look, stakes marking the property line.
- Should be dead ahead.

537
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,494
Can you see the silo?

538
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,877
The bastards built over it.

539
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,422
It's gone.
