1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:02,877
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,712
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,839
If you didn't kill Terrence Steadman...

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,008
...how did someone
make it look like you did?

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,344
- I'm getting you out of here.
- That's impossible.

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,513
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

7
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,368
It better be open, bro.

8
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,036
You're asking me to break the law.

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,454
I ask you to make a mistake.

10
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,456
Forget to lock up.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,792
We're in.

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,800
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

13
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,636
Nobody.
Terrence Steadman's still alive.

14
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,179
Hello, Terrence.

15
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,556
Sound the alarm.

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,160
Hey! Hey!

17
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,039
No! No!

18
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,418
- What do we do now?
- We run.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,677
The escapees, who were they?

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,180
Got a list right here.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,598
Read it to me, if you could.

22
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,143
Michael Scofield, structural engineer.

23
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>Five years for armed robbery.</i>

24
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,522
Benjamin Miles Franklin.

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,235
<i>Former U.S. Army. Eight years</i>
<i>for possession of stolen goods.</i>

26
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,821
John Abruzzi.

27
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,534
<i>Don of the crime family</i>
<i>of the same name.</i>

28
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,079
Life without parole for conspiracy
to commit murder.

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,874
<i>Charles "Haywire" Patoshik.</i>

30
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,878
Sixty years for second-degree murder.

31
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,172
Fernando Sucre.

32
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,968
<i>Five years for aggravated robbery.</i>

33
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,304
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,391
<i>Five years for grand larceny.</i>

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,812
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell.

36
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,442
Life for six counts of kidnapping,
rape and first-degree murder.

37
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,821
And Lincoln Burrows.

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,120
<i>Scheduled to die next week for the</i>
<i>murder of President Reynolds' brother.</i>

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,835
How long has it been
since they got over the wall?

40
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,170
<i>Eight o'clock last night.</i>

41
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,341
- Scofield. He and Burrows are brothers.
- That's right.

42
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,594
<i>MAHONE. And he's the mastermind</i>
<i>of this whole thing.</i>

43
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,555
That's what they're saying.

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,100
I want everything they've got on him.

45
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,429
Where are they?

46
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,682
What the hell is that?

47
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,899
Let's go.

48
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,322
- We gotta make it to the other side!
- What?

49
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,990
- Make it to the other side!
- You crazy?

50
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,705
- Come on!
- Come on, run!

51
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,713
We gotta go! Run! Let's go!
Move it, move it!

52
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,632
Go!

53
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,634
The thing is gaining speed, man!

54
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,680
- It's going too fast!
- Go through!

55
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,058
- What?
- Go through!

56
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,895
Michael!

57
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,648
Hold your fire!

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,036
Freeze! I will gun you down, Scofield!

59
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,874
Michael, come on.

60
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,056
Where's the aerial unit?

61
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,392
They're back on the ground refueling.

62
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,269
Son of a bitch.

63
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,642
Sir, the media is ready.

64
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,427
I'd like to talk about John Wilkes Booth
for a moment, if I could.

65
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,512
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

66
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,306
Twelve days.

67
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,683
That's how long it took to find him.

68
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,395
In his journal during this period, he wrote
that the shadow was his friend...

69
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,230
...the night his domain.

70
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,109
<i>He acknowledged</i>
<i>that neuroses driving the criminal...</i>

71
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,945
<i>...to commit the original crime</i>
<i>is compounded...</i>

72
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,657
<i>...magnified by flight.</i>

73
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,203
<i>By the sounds of dogs at his heels.</i>

74
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,205
Fear becomes paranoia.

75
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,208
<i>Paranoia, ultimately psychosis.</i>

76
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,546
I bring this up because in 140 years...

77
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,592
...the fundamental mind
of the escaped man has not changed.

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,430
The escaped man is still human,
he is still afraid...

79
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,892
...and he will stop at nothing
in his attempted flight.

80
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,853
<i>Fortunately for us...</i>

81
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:23,943
<i>...while our quarry has shadow</i>
<i>and night as his ally...</i>

82
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,737
...we have something far greater.

83
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,782
Television.

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,952
I would encourage everyone
who is watching...

85
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,789
...everyone in this country,
to take a good look at these faces.

86
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,669
These men right here are now
the eight most wanted men in America.

87
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,471
I thought I thought this out.
You saw all those guys back there?

88
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,890
The key is they're back there
and we're up here.

89
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,767
Yeah. And how long
is that gonna last?

90
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,145
Especially since we don't have
a pot to piss in...

91
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,480
...thanks to Abruzzi's
magically disappearing jet.

92
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,649
You were never gonna be
on that plane.

93
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,818
Don't think I don't know
where you were going.

94
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,154
- Where am I going?
- Oh, I don't know.

95
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,822
Utah?

96
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,908
You planning on
telling us about the money?

97
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,618
What money?

98
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,914
Five million dollars that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

99
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,420
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You wish I didn't know.

100
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,130
Wait, wait. What money?

101
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,384
Warden.

102
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,763
It's a little early for the FBI
to be showing up, don't you think?

103
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,141
Look, I get it. It's still your investigation.

104
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,477
Once those criminals cross state lines,
it'll become a federal matter.

105
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,606
- Yeah, well, that is not gonna happen.
- I hope you're right.

106
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,484
That's why I suggest we cut through
any interagency politics from the outset.

107
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,487
- Full transparency.
- Absolutely.

108
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,072
Good.

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,034
Then maybe you can tell me
about Dr. Tancredi.

110
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,620
There's nothing to tell.

111
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,998
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted the escapees.

112
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,667
Opened the door
that allowed them to get out.

113
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,630
- Like I said, there's nothing to tell.
- Not being very transparent, warden.

114
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,550
- Look, I don't discuss my staff.
- Maybe you should...

115
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,011
...because she may be the key
to this thing.

116
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,556
We need to speak with her.

117
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:23,145
Well, right now, Mr. Mahone,
she's not gonna speak with anyone.

118
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:31,904
How we doing?

119
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,323
Well, the IVs are hydrating her.

120
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,202
We've got her on naloxone infusion.
Half-milligram per hour.

121
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,704
What do you think the chances are?

122
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,874
Well, we've done everything
on our end. It's really up to her.

123
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:48,921
Either she fights and lives,
or she quits and dies.

124
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,765
Hey, what do you think--?

125
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,439
Do whatever thing
you've gotta do, man.

126
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh, and boy...

127
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,160
If you call the cops,
I will put this thing right here...

128
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,663
...in your eye.

129
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,836
Thank you.

130
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,189
Structural engineer, huh?

131
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,941
Not the kind you'd expect
to get that much ink.

132
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,360
Not the kind at all.

133
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,572
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that done?

134
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,200
A hundred hours. Two hundred.

135
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,995
Tattoo artist who gave it to him must've
spent a lot of time with him, then.

136
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,748
I'll find out who it was.

137
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,170
- Mr. Bellick.
- Don't talk to me.

138
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,714
Fine. But it's gonna make
collaboration kind of hard.

139
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,717
Collaboration?
I got men out here in harm's way...

140
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,719
...and you're giving press conferences.

141
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,346
The press is a tool.

142
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,015
It'll bring those men back quicker
than bloodhounds will.

143
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,517
We don't need you.

144
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,645
We're hot on their trail, it's a matter
of time till we nail them.

145
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,064
The problem I find
with being on a trail...

146
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,401
...is that, by definition,
you'll always be behind your prey.

147
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,655
We'll see about that.

148
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,372
I'm not armed.

149
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,750
You'll have to excuse me if
I'm a little short on trust at the moment.

150
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,671
I assure you, young woman,
I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

151
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,424
I think the Percocet
pretty much ensures that.

152
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:43,178
Good. Then you won't mind
if I capture this moment for posterity.

153
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,431
Won't do you any good.

154
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,892
You don't care that somebody's
gonna be executed for your murder?

155
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,854
I'm not the one who chose
Lincoln Burrows as the fall guy.

156
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,480
Who did?

157
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,023
Your sister, the president?

158
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,776
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

159
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,112
Oh, come on.
You could've come forward.

160
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,990
You could've stopped this thing
before it even got started.

161
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,451
No, I really am a prisoner.

162
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,161
And now you are too.

163
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,290
The moment you let the door
shut behind you.

164
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,050
Didn't it strike you as curious...

165
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,136
...that there wasn't any security
out there?

166
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,889
The doors only open from the outside.

167
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,434
The glass is 2 inches thick, bulletproof.

168
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,147
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.

169
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,445
We gotta dump them now.

170
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,073
Can't. They know about Utah.

171
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,783
All the more reason to dump them.

172
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,829
If they get caught, the feds will know
where we're going. They'll tell them.

173
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,333
We just gotta make sure they stay afloat
till we're off in Utah.

174
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,460
Doing what we gotta do.

175
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,547
You really think
the money's gonna be there?

176
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,760
Charles might have had
a flexible relationship with the truth...

177
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:09,181
...but at the end... At the end,
there'd be no reason for him to lie.

178
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,851
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico.

179
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,147
Take a whole bunch of bumpy
second-class bus rides till we hit Panama.

180
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,816
You really got a fix on this dive shop?

181
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,193
Yeah.

182
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,989
Right now, I wouldn't mind swinging
in a hammock for the next 10, 20 years.

183
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,118
We got half the country after us.
We ain't making it to Panama or Utah.

184
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,495
Not without help.

185
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,207
Veronica can't help us.

186
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,625
How can you say that?

187
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,711
- We don't have money, clothes--
- We got all that.

188
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,381
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet.

189
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,007
Abruzzi's jet was plan A.

190
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,803
- Then we got--
- Everything we need.

191
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,388
Where?

192
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,099
Storage.

193
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,569
<i>Scofield designed the tattoo, not you?</i>

194
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,572
He brought the entire thing in.
Every element.

195
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,324
I mean, look at it.
It's the frigging Sistine Chapel.

196
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,451
I know the guy was an engineer,
but, man...

197
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,288
...his skill as an artist
was unbelievable.

198
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,915
What else? What can you tell me
about him as a person?

199
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,209
Uh, he was cool, you know.

200
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,713
But talk about a detail Nazi.
Everything had to be perfect.

201
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,592
Exactly as he drew it.
I always sort of had the feeling...

202
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,221
...that the whole thing was some sort
of inside joke that only he was in on.

203
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,810
We have your number, right?

204
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,562
Yeah.

205
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,857
I may be calling you. Thank you.

206
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,069
Foley.

207
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,782
What was the name of that road
to get to the prison?

208
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
I think it was English Street.

209
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,583
In front of the prison,
the two streets that intersect with it?

210
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,961
- Fitz and Percy. Why?
- Thank you.

211
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,967
- Saddle up.
- Where we going?

212
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,179
Somewhere we can stop being cons
and start being civilians.

213
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,558
Yo, why don't you cut out all the riddles,
Snowflake, and give it to us straight?

214
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,143
What?

215
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

216
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,111
Well, hey, little one.

217
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,905
What are you doing?

218
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,865
Well, uh...

219
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,743
We're just fishing.

220
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,412
With no poles?

221
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,374
Well, we like to fish with our hands.

222
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,168
Yeah, that's it. Hand-fishing.

223
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,962
I think the question is...

224
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,425
...what are you doing out here?

225
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,095
- Hunting.
- Gracie?

226
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,348
Get away, Gracie. Get away. Get back.

227
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,849
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

228
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
You're those guys from Fox River.

229
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,813
Don't any of you move
a freaking muscle.

230
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,157
Get away from her.
Get away from her!

231
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,827
Okay, okay. Just relax.

232
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,912
Relax.

233
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,873
- Sir...
- You stay where you are.

234
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,876
- No, no! John!
- Put the gun down! Put the gun down.

235
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,294
- Let her go!
- Right now!

236
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,547
- Let her go!
- John, let go of the girl.

237
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,298
- Shut up!
- Let her go.

238
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,135
Put it down. Drop the gun.

239
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,596
You drop the gun. Drop it now.

240
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,015
You put the gun down.

241
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,893
One...

242
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,354
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

243
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,064
Two!

244
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,237
Good boy. Good boy.

245
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,406
Get the gun.

246
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,324
Pick it up!

247
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,704
- Don't you hurt her. Don't you lay a--
Hey!

248
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,081
Gonna be all right.

249
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,958
Right?

250
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,670
Run to Daddy.

251
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,049
I ain't gonna say anything
to anybody, man.

252
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,011
You're not gonna get hurt,
so just calm down. Where's your car?

253
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,346
- Up on the road.
- I need your keys.

254
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,403
You're being considered
an accessory to this.

255
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,781
You know that, don't you?

256
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,283
I know very little right now.

257
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,787
You opened the door to the infirmary
that allowed Scofield to escape.

258
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,289
- Didn't you?
- No.

259
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,042
- You have a sexual relationship with him?
- No.

260
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,795
But you had feelings for him.

261
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,130
Seven other men got out, you know.

262
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,134
Who?

263
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,152
I'm sorry, sir, it's Saturday.
We're not open.

264
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,530
Well, that's sort of the point.

265
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,989
Sorry, sir?

266
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:23,578
See, I'm gonna need some work done
and I'm gonna need it done, uh, privately.

267
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,872
I'm sorry,
you said you needed the work done?

268
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,001
This is a medical clinic, isn't it?

269
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,254
Well, of course it is, sir,
but for animals.

270
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
God, man, what happened to you?

271
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,846
You need medical attention.

272
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,472
- No.
- I'm gonna get an ambulance.

273
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,979
Nobody's gonna be doing
any calling here, doctor.

274
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,689
Fine.

275
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,316
That's right.

276
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,527
What do you want?

277
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,994
You know what? That's it.

278
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,039
I want Eyetie out of the car right now,
man. That was a little girl.

279
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,083
Don't you have a heart?

280
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,961
God, I have a daughter.
I have a little girl.

281
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,672
I got one too.

282
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,217
But if I hadn't done
what I had to do...

283
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,761
...we wouldn't be on our way
to see them right now.

284
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,222
Turn right up there.

285
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,516
Whoa, hold on. Where we going?

286
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,393
Oswego.

287
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,022
That's west, man. We need to go east.
My family's back in Chicago.

288
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,190
And you think
the cops don't know about it?

289
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,943
You think they're not just sitting there...

290
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,238
...waiting for you
to come running back home?

291
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,365
What's the matter with you?

292
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,826
- What about New York?
- What about it?

293
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,244
My girl's pregnant, bro.

294
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,832
Understand,
your love is your weakness right now.

295
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,042
And they know about it.

296
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,793
Doesn't mean it has to stop you.

297
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,421
You just gotta be smart about it.

298
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,840
And get to Oswego.

299
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,593
Oswego is not on the way, Snowflake.

300
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,429
It's not where Oswego is.

301
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,974
It's what's in Oswego.

302
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,395
Captain, Scofield's credit-card
transaction history.

303
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,023
Spent money in Will County
before he was incarcerated.

304
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,150
- Exactly.
- He's from Chicago.

305
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,069
Why does a guy
from Chicago come here...

306
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,613
...and spend 8 grand
in all these places in a month?

307
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,657
Car wash, voice mail,
storage, car rental.

308
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,408
- We got guys looking into it.
- Good.

309
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,119
- What about the feds? Should we tell?
- What do you think?

310
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,746
Captain Bellick, we got something.

311
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,249
Hunter up by Tamarack
just ran into five of the cons.

312
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,966
So this is where Scofield lived.

313
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,553
Yeah, up until about two months
ago when he was incarcerated.

314
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,893
Mother's dead, father's a deadbeat.

315
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,481
Got nothing in the whole world
but your brother.

316
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,491
So you plan.

317
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,669
And you scheme for months...

318
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,674
...until you get it right.

319
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,178
Every single element.

320
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,646
And then you destroy all the evidence.

321
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,161
I want divers down in the river.

322
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,374
You won't get cell coverage.

323
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,710
We're in the middle of nowhere.

324
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,381
Those digital carriers don't have towers
way out here in Western Montana.

325
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,718
- How about shutting up, Terrence?
- Just trying to save you some effort.

326
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,055
They're like a web, these people.
Harder you struggle, worse it gets.

327
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,891
Sounds to me like a coward
trying to justify himself.

328
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,394
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet,
I stay alive.

329
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,730
That's what they said.
That's what they told me.

330
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,691
And you want to live like this?
In a hermetically sealed box...

331
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,737
- ...while everything outside goes to hell?
- Self-preservation is a strong motivator.

332
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,239
So's the truth.

333
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,578
Don't.

334
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,790
Young woman.

335
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,920
Do not.

336
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,799
Don't.

337
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,428
How you doing, buddy?

338
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,764
I'm pretty freaked out,
that's how I'm doing.

339
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,557
They took your car, didn't they?

340
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,059
1978 Grand Cherokee?

341
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,977
- Yeah.
- Which way did they go?

342
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,480
Up that way. North, toward Oswego.

343
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,440
Oswego. Pardon me.

344
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,400
Scofield's paperwork, get it to me.

345
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,111
That credit card stuff.

346
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,154
Right here, captain.

347
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,452
Of course.

348
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,123
Where else you gonna put
all the crap you need to disappear?

349
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,626
We're going to Oswego, boys.

350
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,096
You have a visitor.

351
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,598
Thank you.

352
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,859
Thanks.

353
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,779
You look disappointed.

354
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,282
No, I thought
you were gonna be my father.

355
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,284
You heard from him?

356
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,995
His office.

357
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,749
Well, brought you a change of clothes.

358
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,920
- Figured, you know.
- Thanks.

359
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,755
And your purse.

360
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,633
You left it in the infirmary.

361
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,685
I'm in a lot of trouble, I think.

362
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,271
I, um...

363
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,651
I need to apologize to you.

364
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,459
They threatened my job
if I didn't talk, and--

365
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,836
No, no. No.

366
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,714
One thing you learn
when you're walking the steps...

367
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,301
...is that you never outsource the blame
that belongs in your own back yard.

368
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,889
Well...

369
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,143
...you're not the first correctional worker
that fell for a con.

370
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,978
Trust me.

371
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,316
He never cared.

372
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,611
Not one bit.

373
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,078
What are you thinking about?

374
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,039
Mistakes.

375
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,708
You had to do it.

376
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,127
Not like I did.

377
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,090
I ruined her life.

378
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,803
- Nothing you can do about it now.
- That's not true.

379
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,057
You fell for her, huh?

380
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,271
Where's Oswego?

381
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,523
Half a mile, maybe.

382
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,566
Good.

383
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,279
What are you gonna do, Terrence,
shoot me?

384
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,948
Blow my guts all over the house?
Then what?

385
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,117
You can't leave, remember?

386
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,828
You kill me, you're stuck with me.

387
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,455
I'm safe here.

388
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,416
You're a prisoner here.

389
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,793
But I'm still breathing.

390
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,380
If I go outside...

391
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,092
...one step, I won't be.

392
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,888
You look at me like I'm the devil.

393
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,059
I gave up my family.

394
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,314
My teeth. I eat Percocet all day...

395
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,817
...just to dull the pain
of my miserable existence.

396
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,946
- You have no idea what I've been through.
- What you've been through?

397
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,533
This isn't about you, Terrence.

398
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,660
Don't.

399
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,292
<i>Blackfoot Sheriff's Department.</i>

400
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,837
<i>Hello? Blackfoot Sheriff's Department.</i>

401
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,505
Hello, my name's Veronica Donovan.

402
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,468
I need you to send a unit to the house at
the end of Light Road as soon as possible.

403
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,928
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am,</i>
<i>are you calling to report a crime?</i>

404
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,139
Yeah.

405
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,558
By the president of the United States.

406
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,853
Send the car.

407
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,564
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't think I can do this.

408
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,317
There are nerves. Look...

409
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,194
- You need a specialist.
- I don't--

410
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,404
You need somebody
who knows what they're doing.

411
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,531
I don't have the luxury of choice here.

412
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,326
My hand has been in that box
for hours now. It is dying.

413
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,078
Sir, I am not capable of doing this.

414
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,207
I only have one hand, but I can stick this
in your neck before you get to that door.

415
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,586
If that's not incentive enough for you,
I see you have a Mrs. Gudat out there.

416
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,755
With a name like that
in a county like this...

417
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,758
...old Mrs. Gudat would not be
too hard to find, now, would she?

418
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,094
Fine.

419
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,887
I can promise you nothing.

420
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,516
Story of my life.

421
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,684
I'll have to put you under.

422
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,063
Do I really look that stupid?

423
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,900
Sir, I cannot do a procedure like this
without an anesthetic.

424
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,610
I have to cut away dead flesh.

425
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,447
Nobody can undergo a procedure like this
without an anesthetic.

426
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:05,243
I ain't nobody.

427
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:11,666
Schweitzer was the company that made
the toilet Scofield took off to get out.

428
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,336
- The Allen bolt was the fitting.
- It's all here, isn't it?

429
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,172
- Yeah.
- It's amazing.

430
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,343
Ripe Chance Woods. Is there a place
in the vicinity with that name?

431
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,761
Got someone looking into it.

432
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,390
DOC's moving on
a storage facility in Oswego.

433
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:47,285
Captain, manager says that Scofield's
got a lease on Unit 164. Still active.

434
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,954
We have guys on 8th Street,
3rd Street and in the alley.

435
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,332
- If they're in there, we got them boxed.
- We push right up the gut, then.

436
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,210
Any one of them makes
a threatening move, put a hole in them.

437
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,628
You got it.

438
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,798
Officer.

439
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,096
This is my collar, smart guy.
Back the hell off.

440
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,732
Close the door.

441
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,906
Still nothing on this place?

442
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,782
Nope.
They're coming back with nothing.

443
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,370
No place by that name anywhere
in this country...

444
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,165
...or any other country for that matter.

445
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,514
Let's go.

446
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,823
Son of a bitch set us up.

447
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,066
Not one word.

448
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,778
Officer.

449
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,369
Nothing.

450
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,208
Oh, that kid's clever.

451
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,753
It's not a place, it's a name.

452
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,299
- Your PDA, you got it?
- Yeah.

453
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,760
Bring up the census of this county.

454
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,971
Far back as it goes.

455
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,060
- Well, somebody's gonna see us.
- Keep digging.

456
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,731
We're gonna go to hell, guys.
Swear to God, we're gonna go to hell.

457
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,279
Help me out.

458
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,581
You are one sick cat, you know that?

459
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,419
What are you looking for?

460
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,883
We gotta go to the cemetery.

461
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,259
Now.

462
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,519
Originally, this was supposed to be a
week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.

463
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,439
But I figured you all need
just as much help as we do, so...

464
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,900
You're doing this
out of the goodness of your heart?

465
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,778
Right, John, the heart.
You remember what that is, don't you?

466
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,946
Damn, Snowflake, this is tight, man.

467
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,699
It's like I said,
we gotta stop being cons...

468
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,576
...start being civilians.

469
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,514
Nice. The trousers are
a little bit too short, don't you think?

470
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,225
Chop your feet off. You're good at that.

471
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,185
This jacket isn't exactly the best thing.

472
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,355
- You know what I'm saying?
- You want variety, hit Target.

473
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,819
Linc.

474
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,655
What have we got?

475
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,782
Money, passports...

476
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,827
...prepaid phone cards.

477
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,497
- Huh. Archie Ryan?
- You see mine?

478
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,873
Phineas McClintock.

479
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,003
Whoa, and these?

480
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,924
Keys to a car that's waiting for us
a couple of hundred yards from here.

481
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,676
That a two-of-us or five-of-us?

482
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,594
That's a two-of-us.

483
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,723
- They know?
- Not yet.

484
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,271
Guys, guys. We got company.

485
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,948
We gotta roll.

486
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,326
How did he know?

487
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,669
We're civilians. Remember that.

488
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,879
We're civilians.

489
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,552
- I'm sorry. Do you know what time it is?
- No, I'm sorry.

490
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,153
I can't go outside. They'll kill me
as soon as I show my face.

491
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,488
You're wrong about that.

492
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,616
As soon as you show your face,
this whole thing is gonna be over.

493
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,493
You can have your life back, Terrence.

494
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,705
- Promise?
- I promise.

495
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,001
Hello?

496
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,794
V, it's me.

497
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,629
- Linc?
<i>- We're out.</i>

498
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:59,049
Oh, thank God you're okay.
I saw the news. You gotta stop.

499
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,302
<i>- I need you to turn yourself in.</i>
- What?

500
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,306
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.

501
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,849
You're gonna be exonerated.

502
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,727
- Come in.
- Steadman?

503
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,770
What are you talking,
you found Steadman?

504
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,231
- Terrence, come on, let's go.
- Afternoon.

505
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,108
<i>- Veronica.</i>
- The police are here.

506
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,444
Look, I need you
to stay where you are.

507
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,696
<i>- Ma'am.</i>
- I don't wanna lose you.

508
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,741
- Ma'am, put the phone down.
- What?

509
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,660
Mr. Steadman, take a few steps back.

510
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,039
Ver-- Veronica?

511
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,249
<i>Veronica?</i>

512
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,001
Oh, my God.

513
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,045
<i>Veronica!</i>

514
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,297
I thought you knew that all calls to
the local station are routed through us.

515
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,675
- This is federal land, remember?
- Mm.

516
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:27,388
And, uh, as for your little toy here.
It's contraband.

517
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,684
- You gonna tell us how you got it there?
- I brought it when I got here.

518
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,563
- Whatever for?
- To protect myself.

519
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:40,025
That's what we're here for, remember?

520
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,473
In less than a day,
<i>the trail has gone cold...</i>

521
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,100
<i>...in pursuit of what are</i>
<i>being called the Fox River Eight--</i>

522
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,186
That's fine. Stay on top of it, all right?

523
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,397
DOC's still doing a sweep of Oswego
but they have basically vanished.

524
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,068
- I wouldn't be sure about that, Mr. Ives.
- Don't know how you can be confident.

525
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,445
It's not like they left a map
where they're going.

526
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,239
Actually, that's exactly
what they did.

527
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,993
Scofield had the entire thing on his body.

528
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,413
<i>How to get out of that prison,</i>
<i>how to disappear afterward.</i>

529
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,083
<i>It's all there.</i>

530
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:24,129
I promise you it's only a matter of time
before we know everything...

531
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,882
...that is in Scofield's head.

532
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,510
<i>Where he plans to run to,</i>
<i>how he plans to get there.</i>

533
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,845
<i>So when the time comes</i>
<i>that he does get there...</i>

534
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,307
...we'll be waiting for him.
