1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,835
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,546
- I got nothing against you, kid.
- What are you doing, man?

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,964
But they do.

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,346
Your pal Manche told me
all about your little treasure hunt...

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,182
...for Westmoreland's stash.
We're going to Utah.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,186
- Fooled you.
- Your hands behind your back.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,063
- Make yourself at home.
- Sure.

8
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,113
Your father spoke to the White House.
They withdrew his nomination.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,657
<i>According to them,</i>
<i>his confirmation was a problem.</i>

10
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,909
My father's not a suicidal man.

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,161
<i>Tancredi, not part of our plan.</i>

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,580
Anyone who knows
<i>has to be dealt with.</i>

13
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>If someone is a liability, they go.</i>
<i>Tancredi was a liability.</i>

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,086
- So is his daughter.
- Wait, what?

15
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>Burrows is scheduled to be released...</i>

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>...from the Clifton detention center</i>
<i>in Kingman, Arizona tomorrow morning.</i>

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,512
L.J.'s out there. I'm gonna get him.

18
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,015
Take care.

19
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:04,355
Charles Westmoreland, God bless you
and your wrinkled old sack.

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,276
- It's all here.
- Where's Sucre?

21
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:11,279
Drop the pack.
No one's going anywhere.

22
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,917
What the hell are you doing, man?

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,962
- Sucre, whatever it is you want--
- I want the money.

24
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,215
- All of it.
- What? Are you robbing us?

25
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,802
The money was never yours
to begin with. This is about business.

26
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,054
Five million dollars worth of business.

27
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,931
So this is how it's gonna go down, huh?

28
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,768
After everything?

29
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,772
Once a thief, always a thief.

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,148
You just figuring that out?

31
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,817
The backpack.

32
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,487
Now!

33
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,742
Don't do this, buddy.

34
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,496
Yo, take a look around you, papi.

35
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,539
There's three of us. There's one of you.

36
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,167
You are outnumbered, man,
and we will come after you.

37
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,629
- It'll be the last thing you do.
- What, are you gonna shoot all of us?

38
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,172
Probably not.

39
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,010
But I will get two.

40
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,806
Now, which two is it gonna be?

41
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:26,479
That's what I thought. Adiós, amigos.

42
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,530
I don't believe this.

43
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,201
We have come all this way
and done all of this work, man.

44
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,870
Thought you was compadres, Tattoo?

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,291
So look,
what are we gonna do now, man?

46
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,168
Police are gonna be here any second.

47
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,256
Ain't no way I'm letting
that dunderpate ride off with 5--!

48
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,383
It's your choice.

49
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,308
It's all right.

50
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,567
All right, I'm gonna give you this...

51
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,737
...and you should be able
to cut yourself free in about an hour.

52
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:22,493
- Yo, so, what's the plan?
- Well, you can do what you want.

53
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,037
I let that psychopath T-Bag loose once.

54
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,831
I'm not gonna do it again.

55
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,917
Make a nice little present
for the police when they get here.

56
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,091
Where is he?

57
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,101
I don't know, man. Look, I gotta--
I gotta go, all right? Uh...

58
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,186
Good luck.

59
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,283
They're gonna get you.

60
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,761
Ms. Tancredi.
Oh, I didn't mean to startle you.

61
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,597
- What are you doing in my house?
- No need to be frightened.

62
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,933
I used to work with your father.

63
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,478
I'm so sorry for your loss.

64
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,238
My father didn't commit suicide.

65
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,371
- What are you doing?
- Making sure it doesn't look like I did.

66
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,332
People ask questions
if the day the governor kills himself...

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,585
...his daughter is found dead
in what looks like a struggle.

68
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,964
Well, then...

69
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,342
...what if they don't find her?

70
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,512
In an apparent attempt
to avoid jail time...

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,849
...the governor's daughter skips bail
and disappears.

72
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,352
We're talking about your last minutes,
Ms. Tancredi.

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,647
- Please don't do this.
- That stuff on the table is premium.

74
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,107
Grade A.

75
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,317
Do yourself a favor: go out on a high.

76
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,027
Look, look, I'm begging you here.

77
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,696
One last ride.

78
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,534
Ah! God!

79
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,260
"Adiós, amigos," huh?

80
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,683
What? Too much?

81
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,769
You were great.

82
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,277
- This thing is freaking heavy, dude.
- It won't be after we split it up.

83
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,780
Three ways: me, you and Linc.

84
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,408
Four. We gotta send a share
to Charles' daughter.

85
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,119
With her father's love,
just like I promised.

86
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,621
What about C-Note?

87
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,999
- Feel bad about the whole thing.
- No way to know if we could trust him.

88
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,752
Once we get to Panama,
we'll send something to his family.

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,796
Make sure he's taken care of.

90
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,256
Five million dollars.

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,134
I can't believe I'm gonna--

92
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,597
Where the hell's the money?

93
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,643
Where the hell is the money?

94
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,339
The backpack.

95
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,882
Now!

96
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,572
Here you go. Watch your head.

97
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,829
Mr. Burrows,
merry Christmas from the state.

98
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,792
Here's a list of options available to you.
Places to stay...

99
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,546
...businesses that are more open to hiring
men out of the correctional system.

100
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,520
Any questions you might have
about your immediate future?

101
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,022
No.

102
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,946
Well, the number on there is toll-free.

103
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,531
If you encounter any problems,
you can call that 24/7.

104
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,701
- Thanks.
- Wait a second, listen. You know what?

105
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,870
Why don't you tell me
where you need to go...

106
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,872
...and I'll make sure you get there.

107
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,629
- You know what? I think I'll be all right.
- You sure?

108
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,798
Yeah, thank you.

109
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,059
Kid didn't bite.

110
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,894
- He's on foot.
- Allright.

111
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,148
Have your men follow him.
Remember, it's the father we want.

112
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,694
We can't go back.

113
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,988
You said it:
without the money, we're screwed.

114
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,156
- We can't--
- Just let me think.

115
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,117
- Maybe there's--
- Just let me think.

116
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,119
Maybe it's still back at the house.

117
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,580
The money's not back at the house
unless T-Bag is.

118
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,667
He must've switched the packs.

119
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,713
What--? What do we do--?
What do we do now?

120
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,342
We still got the 5 grand we took
when we pocketed the money.

121
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,219
It's not gonna be 5 million...

122
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,805
...but it might be enough to get us
where we're going.

123
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,183
All units be advised,
<i>escaped convicts from Fox River...</i>

124
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,104
<i>...have been positively ID'd</i>
<i>at 1131 Monterey Lane.</i>

125
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,273
<i>We have dogs being dispatched</i>
<i>to the location.</i>

126
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,775
<i>I want every road in or out</i>
<i>of town blocked off.</i>

127
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,821
I don't care if it's on wheels, rails or
hooves. I want it stopped and searched.

128
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,616
You said we would have a head start.

129
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,870
It was the gunshot, buddy.
One of the neighbors must've heard.

130
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,080
- How fast can that thing go?
- I don't know.

131
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,166
Both of us, it could probably,
I don't know--

132
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,714
We're never gonna get out of here
on the roads.

133
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,759
We need to find another way.

134
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,390
He's in your office.

135
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,020
Can't believe they're calling me back.
My escapees are out there.

136
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,690
- I wanna know who this guy is.
- Said his name was Sullins.

137
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,360
Son of a bitch.

138
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,322
Let me know
if anything breaks on the convicts.

139
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,162
- Alex, thanks for coming in.
- Wanna tell me why Internal Affairs...

140
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,748
...is pulling me out
in the middle of a manhunt?

141
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,376
It's been a while
since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?

142
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,712
- Not since Shales escape, right?
- Yeah. What's going on, Richard?

143
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,508
Well, that's precisely what I'm here
to find out.

144
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,513
You're not getting out of here until I do.

145
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh, my God, civilization.

146
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,951
Jenny, how about another round
over here?

147
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,455
What can I get for you, boys?

148
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,458
You tell me.

149
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,960
Two waters, then.

150
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,295
And the use of your phone,
if you'd be so kind.

151
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,632
Don't worry, it's a local call.

152
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,762
First thing I do we get home?

153
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,306
- Clean underwear.
- Then what?

154
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,185
Guess I'll go back to that liquor store
and beg for my job back.

155
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,401
We had it. We were so close.

156
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,529
I can still taste that money
right there in the back of my throat.

157
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:05,284
Well, nothing that a couple of Keystones,
a Hungry-Man Salisbury steak dinner...

158
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,620
...and a night in front of the TV
won't take care of.

159
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,084
Hey, Ma. It's Brad.

160
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,129
Hey, listen, me and Roy,
we ran into some car trouble...

161
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,674
...and we're wondering
if you can pick us up.

162
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,801
Well, I don't know.

163
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,511
What the hell town is this?

164
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,348
- Thought you said this was a local call.
- Hey, Bradley, check this out.

165
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,766
Just a minute, Ma.

166
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,811
<i>These individuals were reportedly</i>
<i>the prisoners who escaped...</i>

167
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,982
<i>...from the Fox River Penitentiary</i>
<i>in Illinois just a couple of days ago.</i>

168
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,027
<i>What were they doing all the way</i>
<i>out here in Tooele, Utah?</i>

169
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,281
<i>Well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage</i>
<i>they dug up, has her own theory.</i>

170
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,368
<i>They pretended that they were</i>
<i>some kind of workers...</i>

171
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,539
<i>...from the power company</i>
<i>and that they had made a mistake...</i>

172
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,791
<i>...that they would</i>
<i>have to do some digging.</i>

173
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,418
<i>Investigators just...</i>

174
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:00,506
Hey, Ma, on second thought,
can you wire us some extra scratch?

175
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,424
Turns out we're not done yet.

176
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,942
Hello.

177
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>- Bruce, I need your help.</i>
- Sara?

178
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,446
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide,
okay?

179
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,450
- Okay, just calm down. Where are you?
<i>- He was looking into the Burrows case.</i>

180
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,036
He found something
that they didn't want him to know.

181
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,288
And now I think that they think
that I know it too.

182
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,375
I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna send someone to pick you up.

183
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,419
I'll bring you back here
and we'll sort all of this out, I promise.

184
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,838
<i>- Just tell me where you are.</i>
- Uh...

185
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,882
I don't know. I'm at a payphone.

186
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,970
- Third and Harper.
- You have your cell if I need to reach you?

187
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,430
I do, but I thought it would be tapped.

188
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,683
- I don't know.
- Someone's on their way.

189
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,268
Just stay right where you are.

190
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,979
Thank you.

191
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,867
- I give you 80 bucks for them.
- Come on, man, they're worth--

192
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,495
Worth a lot more to the person
they actually belong to.

193
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,122
These are ladies clubs, doctor.

194
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,042
I'm guessing they're hotter
than a monkey's jockstrap.

195
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,460
Eighty bucks.

196
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,092
Throw in the cooler and you got a deal.

197
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,975
- We gotta lose the bike.
- Uh-uh, no way.

198
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,519
The roads are sealed.
It's the only way we'll make it out.

199
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,979
I can't. I promised Petey--

200
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,481
We're not getting that thing
across the river...

201
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,776
...and every minute we spend trying
is a minute we don't have, okay?

202
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,988
I'm sorry, but we gotta move.

203
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,960
I heard about these kind of places.
They got leeches, you know?

204
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,922
I'll take the leeches in here
over the handcuffs back there.

205
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,507
I don't know, papi.

206
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,926
It depends where the leech leeches,
you know--?

207
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,470
Stop kidding around.

208
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,070
- You all right, buddy?
- I can't-- I can't move.

209
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
You feel like you broke anything?

210
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,491
No, I don't think so.

211
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,534
Can you get it--?
Can you get it off of me?

212
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,036
I'll try.

213
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,586
This thing's not going anywhere.

214
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,755
I'm gonna check your foot.

215
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,982
I'm sorry, buddy. It's stuck.

216
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,650
- I need you to call 911.
- Okay.

217
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,485
Take a deep breath for me.

218
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,615
Okay, Kelli, my name is Sara.
I'm a doctor. You're gonna be okay.

219
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,743
Can you hear me?
You're gonna be all right.

220
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,663
I need you to take some deep breaths
and I need you to hang in there for me.

221
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,458
Okay-- Kelli?

222
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,752
Kelli?

223
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,053
It's gonna be okay, right?

224
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,766
I mean, if you can get eight people
out of prison...

225
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,685
...you can get my Puerto Rican ass
out of this, right?

226
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,813
Can't you?

227
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,119
Damn it!

228
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,258
Did you hear that?

229
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,552
I know that sound.

230
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,096
There's a dam upriver.

231
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,517
It's a signal.

232
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,478
It means they're opening the locks.

233
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,480
That means the water level's gonna rise.

234
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,899
When it does,
the log will just float right off.

235
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,567
Yeah?

236
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,862
K-23, canine units
<i>at the scene have multiple scents...</i>

237
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,823
...and are spreading out into the field.

238
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,116
These guys can't have gotten far.

239
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,912
There were six cons back at that house.

240
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,122
They'll be tracking us in every direction.

241
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,460
It'll take them hours to make it this far.
By that time, the water level will rise.

242
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,921
- And we'll be long gone.
- Are you sure?

243
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,967
Yeah, I'm sure.

244
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,512
I'm sure.

245
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,973
Ask any of the 20 cops there.

246
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,684
John Abruzzi was armed.
John Abruzzi drew his weapon.

247
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,061
He never should have been allowed
to get that far.

248
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,898
Let's be clear. If you knew how things
needed to be handled on a manhunt...

249
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:56,611
...you'd be out there running one
instead of hamstringing the men that are.

250
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,781
The FBI's primary objective
in investigating fugitive matters...

251
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,410
...is to effect the swift location
and capture of the fugitives.

252
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,328
You have two dead bodies, Alex.

253
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,289
I've got two dead felons, Richard.

254
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,417
Maybe that doesn't play well
from a public-relations standpoint...

255
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,629
...but from a public-safety standpoint,
Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.

256
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,758
The shooting of an unarmed kid
at point-blank range is by the book?

257
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,468
Come on.

258
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,306
Incident report,
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

259
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,474
You know, I'm curious.

260
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,768
- Was he cuffed during transport?
- Yeah.

261
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,105
It says in here he somehow managed
to grab your primary weapon.

262
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,816
- You carry that in a shoulder holster?
- Hip.

263
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,485
- Left, right? Right, left?
- Left.

264
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,279
Left.

265
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,991
I'm sorry. I get confused sometimes.

266
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,286
So just so I've got this right...

267
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,998
...you were driving along alone
with a cuffed prisoner...

268
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,834
...and somehow he reaches forward
across your chest...

269
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,336
...grabs your weapon.

270
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,421
Huh...

271
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,341
It's too bad you didn't
react that quickly with Apolskis.

272
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,802
Maybe he'd still be alive.

273
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,263
<i>What does origami</i>
<i>have to do with any of this?</i>

274
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,849
Michael Scofield sent it to her.

275
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,102
And since your brilliant plan
to eliminate...

276
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,688
...Sara Tancredi from the equation
failed so completely--

277
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,858
- I wouldn't say it failed completely.
- There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

278
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,861
A civilian.

279
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,573
A certain number of bodies
you can sweep under the rug.

280
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,868
The president's rug is getting so full
you can barely stand on it.

281
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,663
So, what do you suggest we should do?

282
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,917
- Ever go fishing, Bill?
- Just make your point.

283
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,585
There's two ways to catch a fish.

284
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,172
You cast out a big net and
hope you get what you're looking for.

285
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,343
Or you choose the right bait
and guarantee that you do.

286
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,721
It's a simple strategy,
it plays across the board.

287
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,057
L.J. will lead us to Burrows.
Sara will lead us to Scofield.

288
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,061
How do you intend to follow Sara when
the only lead you got is an origami bird...

289
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,647
...with an out-of-service phone number?

290
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,775
Maybe it's not a phone number.

291
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,044
- What do you have?
- Junior's on the move...

292
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,628
...and still no sign of Burrows.

293
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,882
Sir, the guy's in hiding. Maybe
he doesn't even know his kid's out.

294
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,010
The cop that was held hostage in Utah
has Burrows splitting off...

295
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:11,056
...from the rest of the group just after
word of L.J.'s release hit the wires.

296
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,640
<i>He knows.</i>

297
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,351
Now, if we wanna know for sure
if he's there...

298
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,104
...we need to do something
to draw him out.

299
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,373
Hey, yo, man, spare some change?

300
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,626
- No.
- Come on, man.

301
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,087
- No, I'm all tapped out.
- I know you got something.

302
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,089
- I'll take whatever you got.
- Seriously.

303
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,257
I just got out of lockup.
I would if I could.

304
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,183
- Sorry.
- So you think you're better than me, huh?

305
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:59,062
- I don't think I'm better than you.
- Yo, where you running, little man?

306
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,272
I'm not running anywhere.

307
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,827
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

308
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,121
The reason I went along
with the break was...

309
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,873
...to have a life
with Maricruz and my baby.

310
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,170
And now what? Get some two-bit job?

311
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,090
Always be looking over my shoulder?

312
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,426
What kind of life is that?

313
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,223
You can come with me and Linc
to Panama. Start over.

314
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,474
The longer you stay here...

315
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,518
...the more the chance
you'll never make it.

316
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,604
You got other people to think about.

317
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,648
Your brother. Your nephew.

318
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,733
Sara.

319
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,362
- She's meeting you there, isn't she?
- I don't know.

320
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,364
We never talked about it.

321
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,700
- But you're hoping.
- Give it a rest, will you?

322
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,827
<i>Dogs locked in.</i>
<i>We got two trails merging.</i>

323
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,079
They were here,
headed towards Drucker Ranch.

324
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,456
They've gone off-road.
Any additional units...

325
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,835
<i>...we need to set up a one-mile perimeter</i>
<i>and then start closing in.</i>

326
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,545
It's getting deeper.

327
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,464
Yeah, a little.

328
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,010
So how come this freaking tree
ain't moving yet?

329
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,472
Let me check.

330
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,108
You all right?

331
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,945
Look, Michael...

332
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,573
...I understand
if you have to keep going, you know?

333
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,491
Just shut up. I'm not going anywhere.

334
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,244
- No, look, just think about it.
- If I leave, you drown.

335
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,621
I know, but just--

336
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,748
The water level's getting higher, Sucre.

337
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,292
How many seconds can you hold
your breath? Forty-five?

338
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,378
Sixty? That's how long you've got to live
if I take off.

339
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,590
How long you have if you stay?
Till the dogs lead the cops here?

340
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,761
- What you're suggesting is not an option.
- I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

341
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,348
We both know there are only two things
that can happen now.

342
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,351
Leave me here...

343
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,562
...or we both get caught.

344
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,211
- Bruce?
- Sara.

345
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,673
I know we said not to use this number,
but I needed to know you were okay.

346
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,801
My driver went to pick you up
and the place was a crime scene.

347
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,803
Yeah, the woman that he saw
by the payphone...

348
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,471
...that was supposed to be me.

349
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,307
<i>And I had to leave her there.</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

350
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,227
Who are these people? They knew
where I was gonna be standing.

351
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,354
They knew exactly
where I was gonna be--

352
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,692
<i>- Sara? You there?</i>
- It was you.

353
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,860
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

354
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,571
<i>- I just need to know where you are.</i>
- Oh, my God.

355
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,476
Excuse. We'd like to check
on a friend of ours, L.J. Burrows.

356
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,438
- He's getting stitches.
- We wanna make sure he's all right.

357
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,190
And you can see him when he's through.
It's policy.

358
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,068
- You don't get it.
- I get that that kid defended himself.

359
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,237
- Tell us why you attacked him.
- I did.

360
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,323
- Some guy paid me to.
- Some guy paid you.

361
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,824
- Yeah, of course he did.
- FBI.

362
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,286
- What do you mean, somebody paid you?
- What the hell's it sound like, man?

363
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,956
Some dude gave me 50 bucks
to give the kid a beat down.

364
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,501
It's Burrows. He's here.

365
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,800
How you feeling, slugger?

366
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,136
Dad?

367
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,972
We gotta move.

368
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,433
<i>Hospital security, Wing 3-G.</i>

369
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,978
<i>Hospital security, Wing 3-G.</i>

370
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,494
- There's not much you can do.
- Oh, boy.

371
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,747
Excuse me,
I need to ask you a few questions.

372
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,125
I'm on the follow-up investigation team.
Excuse me.

373
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:36,005
- Gotta go. See you later.
- Uh, we were just curious. Uh...

374
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,343
Did you see if the convicts actually found
what they were digging for?

375
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,678
No, but it sure sounded like they did.

376
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,099
The Spaniard, he took off with
one of my daughter's camping packs...

377
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,267
...and he left the other ones
in a real tizzy.

378
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,686
Sounded like he screwed them
over something fierce.

379
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,355
And they just let him leave?

380
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,191
Well, they weren't happy about it,
but yeah.

381
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,984
He took off on his motorbike.

382
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,195
- Then they left a few minutes later.
- Together?

383
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,407
No, the pretty one and the black fellow,
they left first.

384
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,201
And then that dirty Southerner,
he snuck out the back.

385
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,704
He was moving kind of slow, you know,
with the weight of that backpack.

386
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,541
- And that disability that he--
- Wait, he had a backpack too?

387
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,709
Yes. He came back in...

388
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,713
...and slipped this into my brassiere
on his way out.

389
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,550
He said it was to cover the damages.

390
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,722
Well, we're gonna need
to keep this as evidence.

391
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,768
Thanks for your time. Get in the car.

392
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,071
<i>Seven-three-six, space...</i>

393
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,826
...three-three-nine, space,
eight-six-eight-seven.

394
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,246
And what exactly are you looking for?

395
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,498
A pattern. A code.

396
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,834
Anything.

397
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,573
What? What are you trying to tell me,
Michael?

398
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,330
They say people come into your life
for a reason.

399
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:39,003
Maybe my reason was to help you
get out of Fox River, you know?

400
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,798
- To help you save your brother.
- No.

401
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,725
It's okay, papi.

402
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,728
Let me go.

403
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,814
<i>We're a quarter mile downriver</i>
<i>below the dam.</i>

404
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,985
It's now or never, Michael.

405
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,160
- I want you to hold your breath, okay?
- Why?

406
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,454
Just do it. I'll be right back, I promise.

407
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,434
What the hell are you doing?

408
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,688
<i>All units, redirect to the river.</i>

409
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,316
I want you to go under and then
stick your arm up above the water, high.

410
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,068
All right.

411
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,989
Then when you start running out of air,
wave it back and forth so I can see it.

412
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,865
- Okay.
- And I'll come back and get you.

413
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,367
Okay? Give me your hand.

414
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,372
One, two...

415
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,291
...three.

416
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,369
Come on. Come on.

417
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,163
Sucre?

418
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,836
Sucre!

419
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,582
- Talk to me.
- Well, there is one possibility...

420
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,793
...but it's almost too rudimentary.

421
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,003
We know we're not looking
at a phone number...

422
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,006
...but maybe
we're not looking at numbers at all.

423
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,097
<i>What's important are the letters</i>
<i>that correspond to that number.</i>

424
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,687
Three dots, third letter: R.

425
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,691
Two, D, E.

426
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,110
<i>Three possibilities per number.</i>

427
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,196
<i>That's thousands of letter combinations.</i>

428
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,034
<i>But only one of them spells out a word.</i>

429
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,211
The question is where?

430
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,227
- Hey, what are you in the market for?
- Four wheels and a gas pedal.

431
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,732
Hey, Petey, it's me. Uh...

432
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,734
Listen, I got something to tell you.

433
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,819
Yeah, I was wondering
when you were gonna call.

434
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:18,741
Yeah, um, a lot has come down
since we last talked, and, uh...

435
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,411
<i>Yeah, I know. I heard. You ruined it.</i>

436
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,330
Yeah, um...

437
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,833
- You heard already?
- Well, brother, everybody's heard, man.

438
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,253
And let me tell you something, man.
Hector is pissed.

439
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,381
- What does Hector have to do with it?
- It was his wedding.

440
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,385
- Wait. What are you talking about?
- Your bike. What are you talking about?

441
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,721
- The wedding.
<i>- What about the wedding?</i>

442
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,098
<i>Well, you know the part</i>
<i>where you say "I do"?</i>

443
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,851
Maricruz said, "I don't."

444
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,564
- She did?
<i>- Left homeboy standing at the altar...</i>

445
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,193
<i>...holding his Spam in his hand,</i>
<i>if you know what I'm saying.</i>

446
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,279
What were you telling me
about my bike?

447
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,912
All right. I'll go get your keys.

448
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,541
We got a few stops to make.
First, there's this place call Blanding.

449
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,460
- We meet with Linc in a couple of days--
- I can't go.

450
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,422
She said no, papi.

451
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,384
Maricruz-- Maricruz told that son of a--

452
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,719
She told him no. Can you believe that?

453
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,264
- That's great.
- I know.

454
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,517
Now, I just...

455
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,228
No, go on. Get your girl.

456
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,397
- How about Panama? We said--
- Some other time.

457
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,774
Panama's not gonna go anywhere.

458
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:39,655
And this is in case you run into trouble
down the road.

459
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,371
The river.

460
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,999
I told you to leave me behind.

461
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,959
Yeah, well, I tried.

462
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,753
But, you know,
I got tangled up in the rope, so...

463
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,637
- Okay, here you go.
- Thanks. And, uh...

464
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,849
Think we'll need another car.

465
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,858
Do you really think
the diaper sniper got all of it?

466
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,484
Only one way to find out.

467
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,613
If you're Bagwell and you just
got your hands on $5 million...

468
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,032
...where would you go?

469
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,560
<i>You think you're the only one</i>
<i>that feels betrayed?</i>

470
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,563
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

471
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,231
And when I do...

472
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:01,236
...don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

473
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,256
Let me get this straight.
You paid that meth head to whup my ass?

474
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:25,052
Yeah. Feds were waiting for me
to come get you. It was the only way.

475
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,762
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yeah.

476
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,098
Yeah, it got me four stitches.

477
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,060
Adds character. Here, take that.

478
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,437
There's some ice in there.
Put it on the eye.

479
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,690
Keep the swelling down.

480
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,903
I've been in a few fights in my day too.

481
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,116
Too many.

482
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,039
"Rendezvous. Sundown. Hot."

483
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,479
There's one more bird.

484
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,535
Clean it. Every surface,
like she never came home. Go.

485
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,396
Waiting for your flight from Utah...

486
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,774
...we had a little extra time
for due diligence.

487
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,234
I decided to dig a little deeper
on your history.

488
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,778
Or rather lack of one.

489
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,032
Starts off simple enough. Poor family.
Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.

490
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,036
Somehow your dad holds on to custody,
and by the look of these pediatric meds...

491
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,955
...he beat you like a harp seal
for the next four years.

492
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,459
Big shock: poor abused kid,
not a lot of options, he joins the military.

493
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,796
Will there be any actual questions
or is this just a show-and-tell?

494
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,507
Okay, I got one.
How does a guy go from Infantry grunt...

495
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,509
...with less than stellar marks...

496
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,387
...to the Gulf I Special Ops,
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

497
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,599
...leading the largest manhunt
this country's ever seen?

498
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,185
I have all these dots.

499
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,854
And there's just no way
to connect them.

500
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,316
Looks like you need to work
on your clearance level, Dick.

501
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,735
- Maybe I'll just work on you.
- You wanna do this?

502
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,572
I will chain you to this desk until I get
answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.

503
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,116
You sure you wanna do this?

504
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,910
I know what they tell you
to do overseas, Alex...

505
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,079
...and let me make it perfectly clear.

506
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,290
We do not do it on American soil.

507
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,209
Sir, uh, there's a phone call for you.

508
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,752
I'll take it later.

509
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,088
Sir, you're gonna wanna take this now.

510
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,179
Yeah?

511
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,098
Yes, sir.

512
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,434
I, uh, I'm with him now.

513
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,565
Yes, sir. Bye.

514
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,279
Where you going?

515
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,948
I thought we were really starting
to get somewhere.

516
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,577
Let's go.

517
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,303
Alex.

518
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,680
You got something for me?

519
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,478
Open it.

520
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,483
The numbers correlate to the letters
on a phone.

521
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,528
Only on this one, none of the possible
combinations make sense.

522
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,656
We think it's a location.
A rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.

523
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,034
You find it, you find him.

524
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,494
You could've gotten me
out of there sooner.

525
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,830
Even we have to go
through certain channels...

526
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,042
...to make sure
things appear on the up-and-up.

527
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,794
You know all about that,
don't you, Alex?

528
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,172
Keeping up appearances.

529
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,842
Good.

530
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,598
I'm just making sure that we're still clear
on the directive of this manhunt.

531
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,894
You know, I understand the, uh,
reasoning behind Burrows and Scofield.

532
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,563
But the other men,
criminals that they may be...

533
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,067
- ...there's nothing in their profiles--
- You've been hired to do a job.

534
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,904
The reasoning does not concern you.

535
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,781
You don't ask any questions about us...

536
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:59,743
...maybe we'll continue to make sure
no one asks about you. Are we clear?

537
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:09,878
They all die.
