00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,960
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,505
<i>I need a number</i>
<i>for a Sundown Hotel, please.</i>

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>I got one in Gila, New Mexico.</i>

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,969
<i>NM, 6-3. Tomorrow.</i>

5
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,180
- Who is this?
- I think you already know.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,017
<i>If I buried someone in my own backyard,</i>
<i>I'd think about it all the time.</i>

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:22,563
<i>Let me and my family disappear.</i>
<i>And in return, I'll keep your little secret.</i>

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,691
<i>It's not how you wanted this</i>
<i>to play out.</i>

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,860
But sometimes things happen
that are just out of your control.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,863
<i>MAHONE. I'll see you soon, Michael.</i>
<i>It may be sooner than you think.</i>

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,990
- You can't be here.
- Where's your sister?

12
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,118
- I need to see Maricruz.
- Wedding's at 2:30.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,203
Maricruz, she told him no.

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,206
- Do you believe that?
- Go on. Get your girl.

15
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,172
L.J.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,674
- Both of you, face down.
- Please.

17
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,634
Now!

18
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:55,555
Suspect in custody.
Possible ID, Lincoln Burrows.

19
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,649
Now, you're gonna tell me where
you stashed Westmoreland's money...

20
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,737
...or I'm gonna pluck you like a chicken,
stitch by stitch.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,854
For a millionaire, you travel light.

22
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,609
Hey. Hey, what is this?

23
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,239
It's for my blood pressure.

24
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,787
Lookie what I found.

25
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,456
Guess Ms. Hollander
liked to beat some meat.

26
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,959
A couple whacks with this would help
you remember where you put the money.

27
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,379
Hey, we've been beating his ass all night.
He ain't coming off the goods.

28
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,465
We need to do something different.

29
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,928
It don't matter what you do to me.
I ain't talking.

30
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,139
Well, I ain't stopping
till I get what I came for.

31
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,141
How about we listen to that again?

32
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,559
Please.

33
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,275
Tell me where that money is
or I'm gonna read it on your tombstone.

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,740
Okay. Okay,
I will give you a little clue.

35
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,954
It ain't here.

36
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,017
- Confirmed. Burrows is in custody.
- Yeah!

37
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,732
Unbelievable.
He made it all the way to Arizona.

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,193
Another day, he'd have been gone.

39
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,404
You find Mahone?

40
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,283
No. Keep trying to call,
it goes straight to voicemail.

41
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,618
<i>This is Alexander Mahone.</i>

42
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,036
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,837
- Mr. Kim.
- Mr. Kellerman.

44
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,883
- Lincoln Burrows is in custody.
<i>- That's the reason I called.</i>

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,302
- Who has him?
<i>- Willcox, Arizona P.D.</i>

46
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,679
<i>We need to extricate him. Right away.</i>

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,472
Where's Mr. Mahone?

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,601
I'm getting in touch with him now.
But I can take care of this one.

49
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,729
<i>This is why we hired Mr. Mahone.</i>

50
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,608
- He's the official face here.
- Don't worry, this won't be official.

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,569
- And there won't be any questions.
<i>- Of course there will.</i>

52
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,948
Just make sure
no one's left to answer them.

53
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,588
My son had nothing to do with this,
please.

54
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,798
Ajudge will decide that.

55
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,012
- Did you call in?
- Yeah. Phoenix is sending backup.

56
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,356
I don't think that's one of ours, Jimmy.

57
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,029
What the hell?

58
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:48,996
Hey!

59
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,310
Come on!

60
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,104
I'm coming!

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,443
Move it! Run! Don't stop!

62
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,658
Come here.

63
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,452
- Let go of me.
- Okay, calm down. Calm down.

64
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,332
- You try that again--
- Who are you?

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,376
We're on your side.

66
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,004
We're with your father.

67
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,510
Mahone, Lincoln Burrows
has been apprehended.

68
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,012
- Where?
<i>- Arizona.</i>

69
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,514
I'm on my way, and I need your talents
on the ground.

70
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,891
I'll get there as soon as I can.

71
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,853
I don't think you heard me.
Get to Arizona.

72
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,022
I'm this close to Scofield.

73
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,982
Well, we have a bird in the hand.

74
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,317
Yeah, well, so might I.

75
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,821
You wanted me to figure out
Scofield's rendezvous with Tancredi?

76
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,036
It's happening today.

77
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,628
And I'm sitting right on top of it.

78
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,624
What are you looking at?

79
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,348
- Where are we?
- It doesn't matter.

80
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,019
You're safe here. You can take a seat.

81
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,688
I ain't doing a thing until I see my dad.

82
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,983
All I can tell you is, he's on his way.
His flight lands in an hour.

83
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,611
Why should I trust you, lady?

84
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,240
I don't see you have much of a choice.

85
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,493
I could drop you off back with the cops
if you'd prefer.

86
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,293
- You have somewhere else to be?
- Matter of fact, we do.

87
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,753
Well, we can't let you leave.

88
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,339
Your father was expecting
your brother to be with you.

89
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,049
Do you know where he is?

90
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,051
Do you really think
I'm gonna answer that?

91
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,804
You need to start cooperating
with us, Lincoln.

92
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,641
We're only trying to help.

93
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,898
Michael Scofield.

94
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,525
He escaped from Fox River Penitentiary
a week ago.

95
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,070
Nope. Never seen him.

96
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,823
Well, if you do,
please call me at that number.

97
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,742
Will do.

98
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,619
There's another hotel down the road.

99
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,080
Thanks.

100
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,957
- Yeah?
- You got a fax.

101
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,876
Could you put it under the door, please?

102
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,965
Thank you.

103
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,707
Theresa. It's Fernando Sucre.

104
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,877
- Fernando.
- Theresa.

105
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,380
<i>- She's not here.</i>
- Please don't hang up. I'm so sorry.

106
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,131
Please, just--

107
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,758
I just need to know something.

108
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,219
You've got bigger problems
than my sister right now.

109
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,388
No, no, wait. Please, please.

110
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,516
- I need to talk to her. Please.
<i>- You can't.</i>

111
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,559
My-- We're leaving this afternoon.

112
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,561
- Where are you going?
<i>- Ixtapa, Mexico.</i>

113
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,355
<i>We won't be back for a week.</i>

114
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,441
We're taking the honeymoon
she had planned with Hector.

115
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,069
<i>She's picking me up in a few hours.</i>

116
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,405
- What time?
- A little before 2.

117
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,408
She's gonna have to call me, okay?
I'll give you the number.

118
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,244
- Where are you?
<i>- Take this number of the caller ID.</i>

119
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,204
<i>Please, Theresa.</i>

120
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,249
Just have her call me, okay?

121
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,501
I'll be right here.

122
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,902
Hello, Sara.

123
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,332
I wasn't sure you'd come.

124
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,418
I didn't have a choice.

125
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,924
This isn't gonna be easy for you.

126
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,469
You said in your message
that you had a plan to make this right.

127
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,846
I need to know what that is.

128
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,403
Yeah. Yeah, she checked in last night.

129
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,447
- Was she alone?
- Yeah.

130
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,910
Kelli Foster. I put her in Room 9.

131
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,745
You the guy calling this morning?

132
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,624
- A guy tried to call this morning?
- Yeah, he was trying to send her a fax.

133
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,128
- Did he do it?
- Yeah, 20 minutes ago.

134
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,713
Does your fax have memory?

135
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,464
I guess so.

136
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,806
- Do you know where that is?
- It's five minutes away.

137
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,893
If she comes back,
is there anything you want me to do?

138
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,313
She isn't coming back.

139
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,525
I've arranged for us to get to Panama.

140
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,736
We're meeting up with my brother
tomorrow.

141
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,989
Wait, that's your plan?

142
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,164
To run away to Panama with
the two most wanted men in America?

143
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,670
I came here because I thought you
were gonna have real answers for me.

144
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,255
This is an answer.

145
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,677
And right now,
it's the only one we've got.

146
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,932
Running away into the sunset
with the man who lied to me?

147
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,394
Really? I mean, did you know
about the other guys?

148
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,606
Did you know that I would be putting
T-Bag back out onto the street?

149
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,192
I never meant for that to happen.

150
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,444
I was doing what I needed to do.

151
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,822
- My brother was gonna die.
- Now my father's dead.

152
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,714
I am sorry about your father.

153
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,804
I'm sorry for a lot of things.
For what I did to you.

154
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,724
I have many...

155
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,435
...many regrets.

156
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,397
- But that's the biggest.
- That doesn't help me right now.

157
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,529
I'm sorry for that too.

158
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,242
I didn't expect you to...

159
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,162
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

160
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,166
But I don't want you to...

161
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,586
I don't want you to be alone in this.

162
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,726
I don't wanna be alone.

163
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,113
- Let's go. Get in the car.
- We can't get out this way.

164
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,908
- Michael, that's the only way out of here.
- Then that's the way we're going.

165
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,553
- Hold on. Just hold on.
- Michael, what are you doing?

166
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,472
Just hold on.

167
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,272
Come on.

168
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,995
Michael!

169
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,509
- You all right?
- He's still behind us.

170
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,270
Hold on.

171
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,980
On your feet, Bagwell.

172
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,277
Skewer's hot.

173
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,034
He's got a key.

174
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,753
I'm gonna get that key if I have to...

175
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,679
Down.

176
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,358
We're gonna see that key again, friend.

177
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,277
We're gonna see it real soon.

178
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,533
Give me my credit card.

179
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,286
What did you get me?

180
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,040
What else you get?

181
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:55,545
Prune juice, smokes, a little dip,
and a bag of sliders.

182
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,214
What do you want first?

183
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,135
Looks like a chew guy to me.

184
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,319
- No spitting.
- He's had worse things in his mouth.

185
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,525
What do you want, Fernando?

186
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,194
From the future?

187
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,949
Would you run if I said you?

188
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,995
Would you chase me if I did?

189
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,638
We gotta get back to my car.

190
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,975
It's too far.

191
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,310
If we go now,
before he gets more people...

192
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,896
He's not gonna call for backup.

193
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,942
- He wants his privacy.
- Why?

194
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,819
He's not trying to catch me.

195
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,325
He's trying to kill me.

196
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,380
Your grandfather...

197
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,760
...he was the reason I was set up
in the first place.

198
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,596
He used to work for the people
who wanted me dead.

199
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,349
This is all just to get to him.

200
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,102
Your father should be arriving
any minute now.

201
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,981
- Jane, right?
- Mm-hm.

202
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,443
Sorry.

203
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,112
Don't worry about it.

204
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,614
You know my dad?

205
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,574
Mm-hm.

206
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,076
Well?

207
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,453
Well enough.

208
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,414
- We used to work together.
- Ah.

209
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,791
The Company.

210
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,709
Yeah.

211
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,211
But that was a long time ago.

212
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,963
And now I work against them,
just like he does.

213
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,550
I guess you walked out on your family
too. No explanations, no goodbyes.

214
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,385
I don't have a family.

215
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,971
He really wants to see you
and your brother.

216
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,516
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was 10 years old.

217
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,226
They're here.

218
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,311
Wait here.

219
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,739
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

220
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,325
Michael never met your grandfather.

221
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,160
Hey!

222
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,255
Dad.

223
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,715
I don't wanna get trapped in here.

224
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,093
There's gotta be an exit
on the other side.

225
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,347
- You go on.
- Michael.

226
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,683
I'll be right behind you. Go.

227
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,842
The news is not good. Burrows was
intercepted before I got here.

228
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,261
It is a setback,
but we're not that far behind.

229
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,306
Paul, Paul. Calm down.

230
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,017
It'll be all right.
Someone will take care of it.

231
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,019
Someone who?

232
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,105
Bill, tell me you're not bringing
someone else in on this.

233
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,775
You didn't think
you were alone on this, did you?

234
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,403
You're a soldier. There's an army.

235
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,241
Tell me, what do you have
on Sara Tancredi?

236
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,869
- What does that have to do with this?
- Go back to your original assignment.

237
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,247
Bill, I'm here now. I can do this.

238
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,623
<i>- And then--</i>
- The girl.

239
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,584
<i>We need to know</i>
<i>what her father told her.</i>

240
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,880
When you find out, give me a call.

241
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,931
This is Agent Kellerman. I need that
rental car information on Sara Tancredi.

242
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,952
<i>Yeah, this is it right here.</i>

243
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:30,208
Seventy-five foot, twin diesel Azimut...

244
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,001
...fly bridge, panoramics.

245
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,170
Pull up in a boat like that,
you're somebody.

246
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,588
- Let me see.
- Hey, get off.

247
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,090
No.

248
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,102
How you doing, Bagwell?

249
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,733
- Get the stool.
- What stool?

250
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,693
The stool.

251
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,579
It's from one of them lockers
in a bus station.

252
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,083
I'll try not to think about
where it's been.

253
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,720
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>
- Don't do that. Come on.

254
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,640
Hey there, send the police.
Some scumbag broke into my house.

255
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,518
- Your address?
- Yeah, 1605 Midberry Hill.

256
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,813
<i>- Is he still there?</i>
- Yeah, you better come quick.

257
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,150
- Let's hit it, Roy.
- Come on, now, please don't do this.

258
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,902
Don't leave me like this.
I can take you back to the money.

259
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,071
- I know right where it is.
- So do I.

260
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,199
I'm begging you, don't do this. Please.

261
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,869
Geary, we can make a deal.
I know what you want.

262
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,164
No deals. You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

263
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,499
Wait, please!

264
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,425
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Alex.

265
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,636
You smell that?

266
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,596
It's propane.

267
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,806
It's filling the room.

268
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:55,436
And if you pull that trigger,
we both die.

269
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,826
No!

270
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,455
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
- Maybe.

271
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,832
But before you do...

272
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,293
...let me ask you a question, Alex.

273
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,296
Do you think
you're still one of the good guys...

274
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,131
...fighting the good fight?

275
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,717
Because I think we both know
you've crossed over.

276
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,428
You're on the wrong side
chasing the wrong guys.

277
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,098
My brother is innocent.

278
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,143
- He never killed anyone.
- Well, thanks for opening my eyes.

279
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,772
Okay, Alex, shoot.

280
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,984
- We both know what'll happen.
- The propane will kill me anyway.

281
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,570
What difference does it make?
Might as well do it now.

282
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,780
That's a good point.

283
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,533
There you go.

284
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,996
There. There!

285
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,665
That'll give you time
to think about what you're doing.

286
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,334
But first, a word of advice. Stop.

287
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:06,340
Because when you get close,
I will win every time.

288
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,051
You think?

289
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,599
- I'm not the one in a cage.
- No, you're not.

290
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,893
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

291
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,938
And you just proved it.

292
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,523
You can't kill.

293
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,443
And that's what it's gonna take
to stop me.

294
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,945
Because I don't have
the same reservations.

295
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,822
I can't.

296
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,993
So whether it's today in Gila
or tomorrow in Albuquerque...

297
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,371
...or two months from now in Panama...

298
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,334
...I will get you.

299
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,717
I don't have a choice.

300
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,241
I bought us some time.

301
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,745
- You okay? You're bleeding.
- Let's go.

302
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,705
Get your seatbelt.

303
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,684
Here, 804.

304
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,268
Move.

305
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,791
Ain't that the most beautiful thing
you ever seen?

306
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,918
All that green.

307
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,629
It's prettier than the Grand Canyon.

308
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,465
You know, Roy, this is a monumental
moment for both of us.

309
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,008
Hand over the bag, Bradley.

310
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,637
- Put down the pounder, Grandma.
- Hey, hey, I'm not kidding around.

311
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,223
Oh, you think your pansy ass--?

312
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,780
Next time, you pick through the crap.

313
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:09,231
Okay, first-aid kit, disposable phones,
a couple of toothbrushes.

314
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,649
What about the motel?

315
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,320
They charge by the hour,
so they didn't ask for ID.

316
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,621
- Do you have the keys?
- Yeah.

317
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,833
Want your hat?

318
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,767
We're not home.
<i>Leave a message at the beep...</i>

319
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:49,480
<i>- ...and we'll get back to you.</i>
- Theresa, this message is for Maricruz.

320
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,358
I was right there waiting for your call...

321
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,194
...but the cops showed up
and I couldn't pick up the phone.

322
00:35:55,362 --> 00:36:00,115
I know probably that's the exact reason
why you may not wanna be with me.

323
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,409
Listen to me.

324
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,871
My Aunt Idalyz,
she lives outside Mexico City.

325
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:11,502
In the mountains, on a farm,
with a llama for the baby to ride.

326
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,756
So next week,
when you fly back home...

327
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,926
...when you go to the airport,
I'll be there.

328
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,054
In the airport, in Ixtapa, waiting for you.

329
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,890
I promise you, mi vida.

330
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,143
I love you, Mommy.
I love you more than anything.

331
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,437
And I can't live without you.

332
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,150
I just know I can make it work, baby.

333
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,239
This is in case you run into trouble
down the road.

334
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,620
I have a way.

335
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,915
- Where is she?
- Who?

336
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,543
Maricruz. She wasn't at home.
She's not at work.

337
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,170
Well, she's not here.
I don't know where she is.

338
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,965
You trying to cause problems for me,
bitch? Don't lie to me.

339
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,600
She went to Mexico, didn't she?

340
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,103
Went on our honeymoon.

341
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,024
Paid for with my money.

342
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,572
This isn't gonna feel good.

343
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,533
I have a high
tolerance for pain. You know that.

344
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,201
You do.

345
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,205
And you're not a diabetic, are you?

346
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,045
Right.

347
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,889
Michael, tell me something.

348
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,226
You think there's a part of you
that enjoys this?

349
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,229
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

350
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:58,400
I mean escaping from prison...

351
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,738
...and being on the run and the danger
and the fear and the rush. All that.

352
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,531
It...

353
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,119
It feels to me like chasing a high.

354
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,289
And...

355
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,001
And I know what that's like...

356
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,545
...and I should know better by now.

357
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,884
I never thought about it like that.

358
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,560
I know you've heard this before...

359
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,105
...but it won't always be like this.

360
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,274
From everything you've told me,
it's getting worse.

361
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,026
They can't chase us forever.

362
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,654
The guy who caught up with us today
stops at the border.

363
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,906
That's why we have to get across.

364
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,283
I have the people in place
to help us do that.

365
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,327
We're meeting them tomorrow.

366
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,456
One more day, Sara.

367
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,085
One more day.

368
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,505
That's all I'm asking.

369
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,718
You can go get cleaned up.

370
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,428
Keep this dry.

371
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,235
Sara...

372
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,365
...I'm glad you came.

373
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,251
So...

374
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,880
...this is him.

375
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,965
Lincoln Junior.

376
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,886
- Named him after yourself.
- I wasn't gonna name him Aldo.

377
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,475
L.J...

378
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,101
...this is your grandfather...

379
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,729
...Aldo Burrows.

380
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,273
Hi.

381
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,653
I've waited for this for a long time.

382
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,447
Um...

383
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,371
I've arranged a safe place
for both of you to go to.

384
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,002
Well, thanks for bailing us out...

385
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,629
...but we gotta meet Michael.

386
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,380
Where is he?

387
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,384
Down by the border.
A place called Bolshoi Booze.

388
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,512
- I can go alone and get him.
- No.

389
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,142
Things are different.

390
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,894
There's some evidence.

391
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,729
We just need a little more time...

392
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,315
...and we can blow this whole thing
wide open.

393
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,944
There is no time. I trust Michael.
He has a plan to get us to Panama.

394
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,946
You don't understand, Lincoln.

395
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,323
You don't need to go to Panama.

396
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,034
You don't need to run anymore.

397
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,747
Where is he?

398
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,251
I can go alone to get him.

399
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,462
- Tell me good news.
- Hey.

400
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,590
I got Burrows. The trifecta.

401
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,218
<i>- Take care of them.</i>
- What about Scofield?

402
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,554
- They're gonna meet him.
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

403
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,889
Do it now.

404
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,470
Sara?

405
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,467
Hi, Sara.
