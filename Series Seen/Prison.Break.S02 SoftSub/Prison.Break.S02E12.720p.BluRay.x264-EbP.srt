1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,044
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:06,464
Listen, why don't I give you
half the money and we call it a day?

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,091
All right, 60-40.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,093
You thieving son of a bitch.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,471
You better get down on your knees
and pray to God that I don't find you.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,725
Because if I do, mark my words,
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,477
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,646
Do you mind answering
a few more questions?

9
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,565
We have a lead as to where
Burrows will meet with his brother.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,526
A place he referred to
as Bolshoi Booze.

11
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:27,860
They're numbers.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,404
Plug them into your GPS.

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,323
It'll take you to a spot
in the New Mexico desert.

14
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,867
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby. You ready to go?

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,704
Come on. Go, go, go!

16
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,331
What do we do now?

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,212
<i>- Has she told you anything?</i>
- Not yet.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,881
- Then kill her.
- Well, if she knows something...

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
You disobey me, you are done.

20
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>Put her in the ground, Paul.</i>

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,428
You're going to die.

22
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,723
And all you had to do was tell me
what your father gave you.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,182
Go to hell.

24
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,482
The plane's gonna stop
at the seven-mile marker...

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,735
...Route Four, at sunset.

26
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,195
- We gotta go.
- I brought someone. Dad?

27
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,907
We've met before.

28
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,914
- It was you.
- Go easy, son.

29
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,751
Stay away from me.

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,879
- What the hell's going on?
- I know him.

31
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,424
- You know him? That's impossible.
- I know him. I know this man.

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,351
- Michael.
- Maybe that's far enough.

33
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,354
- This doesn't concern you.
- What the hell's going on, Dad?

34
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,112
After Mom died...

35
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,616
...you were in juvie.

36
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,788
They put me with this foster father...

37
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,540
...down on Pershing Avenue.

38
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,711
He punished me.

39
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,297
Locked me up.

40
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,634
<i>If you leave someone alone</i>
<i>in the dark for that long...</i>

41
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,970
<i>...their eyes start to adlust.</i>

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,476
<i>You start to see things,</i>
<i>no matter how small...</i>

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>...because if they exist,</i>
<i>they can help you.</i>

44
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>Help you do</i>
<i>the only thing you wanna do...</i>

45
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,404
<i>...when you're alone in the dark.</i>

46
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,742
<i>Get out.</i>

47
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,691
<i>I've used just about</i>
<i>every lure that you can use.</i>

48
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,861
<i>Most of them,</i>
<i>you need to be an expert to use.</i>

49
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,863
<i>This MotoLure's a little different.</i>

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>Everybody, I mean,</i>
<i>everybody, can fish with it.</i>

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,244
<i>Catch bigger fish,</i>
<i>you're gonna catch more fish.</i>

52
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,874
<i>It even works in weedy areas</i>
<i>where most top water lures won't work.</i>

53
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,751
<i>Take a look at this baby.</i>
<i>This thing looks like a real minnow.</i>

54
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,379
<i>It's one very cool bait.</i>

55
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,716
<i>I have never seen</i>
<i>anything quite like this.</i>

56
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,177
<i>Even if you've bought lures off TV</i>
<i>in the past and been disappointed...</i>

57
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,221
<i>...and believe me, I know how you feel.</i>

58
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,517
- Oh, sorry, man. I thought you'd left.
- Hey. No, still here. Here I am.

59
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,853
It's just that a couple guests
are complaining...

60
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,479
...about the volume of your TV.

61
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:55,067
Oh, sorry. I fell asleep.
I must've hit the remote.

62
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,904
- I'll take care of it. Thanks. Sorry. Thanks.
- That's great.

63
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,658
So could you do that for me now,
please, so it's taken care of?

64
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,369
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

65
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,340
Taken care of.

66
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,719
Is everything okay in your bathroom?

67
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,972
Excuse me?

68
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,558
In your bathroom.
There's a noise coming from it.

69
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,603
Yeah, my daughter
thinks bath time is playtime.

70
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,940
I will clean it up. Scout's honor. Sorry.

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,401
- All right. Have a nice day.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,654
You too.

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,499
- Michael!
- Michael.

74
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,126
- Michael, please, wait.
- He did this to you?

75
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,419
Lincoln!

76
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,966
He did this to you?

77
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,469
Did he do this to you?

78
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,477
Michael.

79
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,314
How could you do that
to another human being...

80
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,650
...with your own hands?

81
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,495
It's okay.

82
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,580
You're safe now.

83
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,504
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

84
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,347
Come on.

85
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,101
Come with me and don't look back.

86
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,322
Michael!

87
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,659
Michael.

88
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,334
It's gonna be all right.

89
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,515
Sara!

90
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,886
<i>Six months.</i>

91
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,306
Six months I was in that place.

92
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,600
Where were you?

93
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,435
How long did you know?

94
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,188
I found you as soon as I could.
The state kept moving you.

95
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,606
Then you went away again.

96
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,150
You don't think it killed me
to leave you like that?

97
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,818
To leave in the first place?

98
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,737
Since the beginning, I was the problem.

99
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,865
Since day one. Your lives
are what they are because of me.

100
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,742
Yes, Linc told me about The Company.

101
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,537
You were some kind of analyst. That's
the job you chose over your family.

102
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,082
I thought I was doing the right thing,
protecting you.

103
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,917
From what, Dad? From who?

104
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,879
The Company had enemies.
I was important to The Company.

105
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,424
I became a target. Easiest way
to get to me would be to get to you.

106
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,219
I left as soon as I realized
how corrupt it was.

107
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,180
- How they were buying the government.
- You could've come back.

108
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,932
No, I couldn't!

109
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,770
Michael, turning on The Company
put me and you at even greater risk.

110
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,606
I had to stay away.

111
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,192
We were your sons.

112
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,902
And you still are, Michael.

113
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,613
We can fix this.

114
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,700
I came back so that we could fix this.

115
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,787
This can never be fixed.

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,834
There's a tape.

117
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,920
It gives us everything we need.

118
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,882
Linc will be set free if we find it.

119
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,468
You're not gonna believe
who he thinks has it.

120
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,804
Who?

121
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,973
Sara.

122
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,023
Yes, tall, slender,
brown hair, brown eyes.

123
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,066
She'd be pretty banged up.

124
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,444
<i>No one matching that description...</i>

125
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,112
<i>...has been brought into the ER.</i>

126
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,909
Kellerman.

127
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,536
The report on Sara Tancredi?

128
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,997
She's dead.
I'm dealing with the body right now.

129
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,460
- You must be relieved that it's over.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

130
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,254
- Yeah, I gotta go, Bill.
<i>- One more thing.</i>

131
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,672
<i>Confirmation.</i>

132
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,467
I need a photo of the body
before disposal.

133
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
<i>Take one with your phone</i>
<i>and send it to me, and I'll--</i>

134
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,680
Bill, not a good time right now,
all right?

135
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,060
Paul, take a breath...

136
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,645
...then take the picture.

137
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,481
I'm waiting.

138
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,535
"They traveled
into a very dangerous place.

139
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,206
Now, Arvid knew that, but he held
tightly onto the dragon's leash anyway...

140
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,708
...as the creature ran
into the ever-dark forest...

141
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,044
...pulling the young boy behind him."

142
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,922
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

143
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,050
Well, because he loved the dragon.

144
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,888
And when you love someone,
you'll do anything to hold onto them.

145
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,475
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

146
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,519
Is that why we're camping?

147
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,022
Yep, so we can all be together.

148
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,733
I'm happy.

149
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,738
You know, I'm happy too.

150
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,705
Here you go.

151
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,429
Well, it's all working out, huh?

152
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,181
Don't say that.

153
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,990
You know, this moment,
right here, right now...

154
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,243
...it's all worth it.

155
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,584
I love you.

156
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,153
Oh, that's old.

157
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,490
- The kids are bigger now.
- Sorry, I was just...

158
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,076
Oh, getting bored out of your wits
because you've been waiting so long.

159
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,078
I'm really sorry about all this.

160
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,498
We don't get a whole bunch
of homicides out here...

161
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,334
...and we're trying to play catch-up.
Please, have a seat.

162
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,506
I'm real sorry about your friend.

163
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,800
It's a sick world out there.

164
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,011
Ain't that the truth.

165
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,848
- So you guys out here in Kansas together?
- Yeah, that's right.

166
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,517
Doing what?

167
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,727
Well, you know, just seeing the sights.

168
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,563
You left Chicago to see the sights
in Tribune, Kansas?

169
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,815
Last I checked,
a man could go where he wanted.

170
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,735
- Mr. Bellick.
- Brad.

171
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,404
Brad.

172
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,990
I don't really care
what you were doing out here.

173
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:31,203
We're both in law enforcement. We
can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.

174
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,956
Pardon my French.

175
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,708
And we both know
you're not a criminal...

176
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:41,880
...so I don't care if you boys were out
here whooping it without your wives...

177
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,383
...or going Brokeback.

178
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,051
What?

179
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,427
Hell, no.

180
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,180
My point is,
I don't care what you were doing.

181
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,226
I just need to know where you were doing
it and who you crossed paths with...

182
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,937
...so I can find out
who carved up Mr. Geary.

183
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:07,990
Geary and I got a lead that one
of the Fox River Eight was in town.

184
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,866
Which one?

185
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,412
- Theodore Bagwell.
- The man who did those horrible things...

186
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,455
- ...to those teenagers?
- That's him.

187
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,001
We were gonna bring him in for the
reward, but we couldn't get a handle.

188
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,878
Geary and I split up,
we figured we didn't have a shot, but--

189
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,047
- But what?
- Well, after what happened...

190
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:28,135
...I'm starting to think maybe Geary
ran into old Bagwell after all.

191
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,971
Right here in Tribune?

192
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,225
Now, Brad, do you think
you could answer some questions...

193
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,604
...that might help us, you know,
track down Theodore Bagwell?

194
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,272
I'd be indebted.

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,817
I'll do whatever I can to help nail
that son of a bitch.

196
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,902
You think Sara has this tape?

197
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,404
The government does.

198
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,825
I just saw her yesterday.
If she does have anything...

199
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,285
...she doesn't know.

200
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,747
- Well, where is she now?
- I don't know.

201
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,583
Any way you can
get in touch with her?

202
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,961
- We bought cell phones. I could call her.
- Please, please, please, bro.

203
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,714
Call her from Panama, please.

204
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,258
We got less than two hours.
I gotta make the flight.

205
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,679
Shh, shh, shh.

206
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,181
What?

207
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,604
Run. Run!

208
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,113
- Where's this car you keep talking about?
- It's over the ridge.

209
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,282
Give me that.
You guys head for the car.

210
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,951
Go!

211
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,627
Come on, come on!

212
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,178
Come on! Go, go, go!

213
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,056
Pick up Dad!

214
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,143
Dad, get in!

215
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,232
Come on, Dad!

216
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,411
Woo-hoo-hoo! We made it!
Son of a bitch, we made it!

217
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,752
Linc.

218
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,685
Sucre, get us to a hospital.

219
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:46,273
- Out here? Where am I gonna find--?
- Just get us to a hospital, please!

220
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,942
Don't worry, you're gonna make it.

221
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,154
It's bile. He got me clean through.

222
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,449
You're gonna be okay. Just hold on.

223
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,034
Listen to me, both of you.

224
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,122
Sorry.

225
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,583
I wish I'd never left.

226
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,838
Don't talk. Just breathe, okay?

227
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,262
Okay. So do you want a P.B.& B.?

228
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,141
Not really. My tummy hurts.

229
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,768
Huh.

230
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,311
Where's her knapsack?

231
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,480
Her what?

232
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,151
- Her knapsack. Her medicine's in it.
- I don't know. I just grabbed her and ran.

233
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,154
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

234
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,823
Okay, I know. I'm her father, all right?

235
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,326
Where is it?

236
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,162
Baby, baby. Look, look, calm down.
What are you looking for?

237
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,081
Just tell me what it is
and I'll go ahead and get it, okay?

238
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,958
Her prescription.

239
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,171
It's a backup. I keep an extra, in case.

240
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,590
Okay, okay.

241
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:58,929
So all I need to do is find a pharmacy.

242
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,768
Don't worry.

243
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,979
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride,
sweet pea.

244
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,483
If we nail Bagwell, he might still have
some of Geary's things on him...

245
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,194
...like his backpack,
which has his personal stuff in it.

246
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,780
I know his wife would love to have it.

247
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,989
If we find Bagwell...

248
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,866
- ...give it to her personally.
- Thanks.

249
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,161
It's the least I can do
considering how you're helping me out.

250
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,248
Although some of the guys
on the force are concerned about...

251
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,001
- What are they concerned about?
- Oh, nothing.

252
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,879
You know what?
Why don't you tell me what you know?

253
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,799
We'll track down Bagwell,
get Geary's effects to his family.

254
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,885
I'll make sure everybody involved knows
your help was invaluable.

255
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,973
I'll even recommend that you get most of,
if not all of that reward money.

256
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:47,727
Well, what is it exactly that the guys
on the force were concerned about?

257
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,316
Some of them thought you weren't
being totally up front about your injury.

258
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,862
I mean, to be fair, it does seem
a little off that you didn't see the guy...

259
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,407
...who hit you smack-dab
on the forehead.

260
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,704
You got me.

261
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:11,251
Geary and me had a little dust-up
over how to go about finding Bagwell.

262
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,754
It got physical and he hit me.

263
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,758
The two of us, we fought like brothers.
I didn't wanna rat him out to the cops.

264
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,263
After the fight, we split up.

265
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,432
And then...

266
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,686
Well, you know what happened to him.

267
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,982
I just wish to hell we'd never fought,
you know.

268
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,902
Maybe then, he'd still be...

269
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,739
Brad, you can't blame yourself.

270
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,038
Why don't we refocus our energy on
finding the man who killed your friend?

271
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,627
That's what Roy would've wanted.

272
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,147
Where you at, baby?

273
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,068
Insurance card?

274
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,403
No, I don't have insurance.

275
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,490
You're paying for dexamethasone
without insurance?

276
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,826
You got Medicaid,
Medicare or something?

277
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,245
Nope. I'll just pay cash.

278
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,748
It's 125.

279
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,261
Excuse me.

280
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,056
Excuse me?

281
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,142
Oh, sorry.

282
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:04,322
I'm sorry I don't have
anything smaller.

283
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,949
Um...

284
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,451
I have to go to the back
to get change for a hundred.

285
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,286
So I'll be right back.

286
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,093
- Right there, hospital!
- I see it, I see it.

287
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,303
- Just get us there.
- No, you'll be caught.

288
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,305
Then we'll be caught.

289
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,558
I'm not gonna let you die.

290
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,810
Then listen to me.

291
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,896
You find Sara Tancredi.

292
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,441
She can end this.

293
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,028
It's up to you now.

294
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:58,626
Yeah, I want an alarm out
on a dark blue sedan, license AE 9268.

295
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,212
Forty miles southeast of Las Cruces.

296
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,007
Do it now.

297
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,261
Oh, come on.

298
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,473
What?

299
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,517
What hospital?

300
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,903
Came in with a bad GSW.
Docs called us in.

301
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,113
He's in here.

302
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,823
We ran his name.

303
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,827
Came back with two federal
drug-smuggling warrants out on him.

304
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,371
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

305
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,795
I got some information the feds want.

306
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,131
About Michael Scofield.

307
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,096
Like where he's catching a ride.

308
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,224
And where would that be?

309
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:59,229
It's not just the where, but the when.

310
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,315
That when is coming up soon.

311
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,985
But I wanna cut a deal first.

312
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,157
Give us a minute?

313
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,419
Anything you wanna say?

314
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,173
One day.

315
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,510
That's all we had.

316
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,372
Back then,
when things were at their worst...

317
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,710
...there were days I thought
I'd never see the sun again.

318
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,838
But he saved my life.

319
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,179
Just wish he could've let us
be a part of his.

320
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,519
Yeah.

321
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,238
I'll tell him.

322
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,620
Here's the deal.

323
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,372
All charges dropped,
government picks up medical costs...

324
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,166
...until you're fit to be deported.

325
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,878
All contingent upon your information
being accurate.

326
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,672
Where's Scofield?

327
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,927
No deportation. I want citizenship.

328
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,305
Citizenship?

329
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,351
A little incentive,
and I want it in writing.

330
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,728
Oh, I'm so tired of playing games.

331
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,189
Well, start typing.

332
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,447
No external pacemaker.

333
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,577
Hey, this is a good one.
No morphine drip.

334
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,288
- What are you doing?
- FBI. Out, out, out.

335
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,876
- What the hell are you doing?
- Giving you a little incentive.

336
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,921
Come on. Come on, you son of a--

337
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,923
And they found nothing?

338
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,592
Okay, thanks.

339
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,636
Well, your instincts are great, Brad.

340
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,098
But the precinct actually sent a unit over
to Hollander's house today.

341
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,268
An anonymous caller said they saw
an intruder but no one was there.

342
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,978
Damn it.

343
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,980
If you knew about
Bagwell and Hollander...

344
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,315
...why didn't you just head
over there yourself?

345
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,068
Oh, we couldn't find the house.

346
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,488
Really? It's listed.

347
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,329
Excuse me.

348
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,672
Thank you.

349
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,675
Everything okay?

350
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,095
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

351
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,975
You ever been to the Fauntleroy Hotel?
It's about 15 minutes from here.

352
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,312
- Never heard of it.
- Well, that's strange.

353
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,064
Because they found this receipt
in Geary's hotel room.

354
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,691
It's from your credit card.

355
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,863
I don't know how that got there.

356
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,912
I think you're being evasive.

357
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,334
- You should tell me the truth, Mr. Bellick.
- What happened to "Brad"?

358
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,920
About seven years ago,
I got my first homicide case.

359
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,089
A woman. Pretty.
She was brutally attacked.

360
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,633
Animal boyfriend left her for dead.

361
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,636
But she was still breathing, barely.

362
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,264
But she punched into her cell phone...

363
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,768
...the killer's number,
so she solved the crime for us.

364
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,104
When we found the receipt, Brad,
it was in Geary's hand...

365
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,441
...his finger pointing to your name.
With his last ounce of strength...

366
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,651
- ...he told us you killed him.
- Okay, listen.

367
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,529
Geary and I found Bagwell
in Hollander's house.

368
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,367
We roughed him up until he told us
where he'd hid the 5 million bucks...

369
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,077
...we knew he'd dug up in Utah.

370
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,537
When we found the money,
Geary double-crossed me...

371
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,790
...he hit me in the head
and took the cash.

372
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,251
I had nothing to do with Geary's death.
You hear what I'm saying?

373
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,962
I'm the victim here,
not that son of a bitch.

374
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,351
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

375
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,894
Where you at, baby?

376
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,819
Hey, could you hurry it up?

377
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,905
It's just it's getting really late
and I gotta get home.

378
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:13,626
And that's 20, 40, 50 and 20 is 70.

379
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:19,090
One, two, three, four, five is 75.

380
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,927
Excuse me.

381
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,357
You gotta be kidding me.

382
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,243
Ma'am.

383
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,287
Afternoon, officer.

384
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,332
Do you have any ID with you?

385
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,295
No, I walked over here,
so I didn't carry anything with me.

386
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,964
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

387
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,758
Is there a problem, officer?

388
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,220
There's only a problem
if you make one, Miss Franklin.

389
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,222
You want to tell us
where your husband is?

390
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,768
I don't know.

391
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,938
Place your hands behind your back,
please, ma'am.

392
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,951
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

393
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,136
Oh, my God.

394
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,597
Where's Mommy?

395
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,021
Mommy is gonna meet us later, okay?

396
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,530
- Yes?
- Where's the photo?

397
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,240
Bill, there was a tactical error.

398
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,993
I don't want terminology from
the Cover Your Ass Handbook, Paul.

399
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,539
- What happened?
- There were unforeseen circumstances.

400
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,833
- Things that could not be predicted.
- Where's Sara?

401
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,087
She's gone, isn't she?

402
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,635
Yes. She got away.

403
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,845
<i>But there is no way that she--</i>

404
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,682
Bill?

405
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,756
I'm not gonna let you die.

406
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,552
I love you.

407
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,724
You know that, don't you?

408
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,407
Too many.

409
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,412
Too many people died
because I wanted you to be free.

410
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,790
You couldn't have known, Michael.

411
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,418
You couldn't have known
it would've ended up like this.

412
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,878
But it did.

413
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,383
They wanted him.

414
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,844
They wanted him in the ground...

415
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,596
...and they got their wish.

416
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,017
This thing's not gonna end here,
Michael.

417
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,979
- I know.
- It's gonna keep spreading.

418
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,276
Their hands are gonna get more
and more bloody.

419
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,570
The question is...

420
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,700
...is the blood on their hands or ours?

421
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,624
I'm sorry, guys.

422
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,794
We gotta go.

423
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,442
Get back on with border patrol. Call
the Navy Reserve Air Station in Dallas.

424
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,818
They've got planes on alert.

425
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,612
We need an intercept
of a white single-engine A-36 Beech...

426
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,114
...heading toward the border.

427
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,284
Call Mexico. Get clearance
for an international pursuit.

428
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,537
Tell them if they've gotta take
the plane down, just do it.

429
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,291
Come on, guys.

430
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,335
Guys, come on.

431
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,003
Come on, guys.

432
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,090
What?

433
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,803
We're staying.

434
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,978
Michael, this is what
we've been waiting for.

435
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,731
Maybe we'll see you
down there somewhere.

436
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,235
I can't talk you out of this one, can I?

437
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,160
Oh, I hope so.

438
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,038
Be good.

439
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,792
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you for everything.

440
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,132
- You take care of him, all right?
- I will.

441
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,760
Fly safe, papi.

442
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,766
Give them hell.

443
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,161
- Panama would've been good.
- Are you ready for this?

444
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,164
- Been waiting years.
- Good to hear it.

445
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,167
Because today's the day
we stop running.

446
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,811
- What now?
- We go back to the car...

447
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,023
...drive to a border town,
find a cell phone signal...

448
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,317
...and call Sara.

449
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,997
Where the hell are those jets?

450
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,469
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

451
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,807
Pull over.

452
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,155
They're going after Sucre.

453
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,866
They're gonna take him down.

454
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,286
- How'd they find out?
- I don't know.

455
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,376
Michael.

456
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,326
What the hell is going on? If you could
arrest me you would have already.

457
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,162
- I'm out of here.
- Not really an option for you.

458
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,582
What've you got? A receipt?
He left it in his pocket. A fight? Big deal.

459
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,378
I got 10 pals in Chicago who'll tell you
Geary and I threw down once a month.

460
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,881
You're right. Any of those things
on their own, probably not enough.

461
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,591
But when you add this.

462
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,219
What the hell is that?

463
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,596
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

464
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,434
<i>You thieving son of a bitch.</i>

465
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,812
<i>You better get down on your knees</i>
<i>and pray to God that I don't find you.</i>

466
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,567
<i>Because if I do, mark my words,</i>
<i>I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.</i>

467
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,779
You wanna hear it again?

468
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,783
Now, at this juncture, Brad...

469
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,120
...things will go a whole lot easier
for you if you admit to the crime.

470
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,124
Now, you listen to me,
you manipulative little bitch.

471
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,420
I did not kill Roy Geary!
You understand what I'm telling you?

472
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,339
Bagwell set me up!
Get your hands off of me!

473
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,718
You are under arrest for the murder
of Roy William Geary.

474
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,345
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

475
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:53,140
...can be used against you.
You have the right to a lawyer...

476
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,976
...and to have him present.
If you cannot hire a lawyer...

477
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,145
...the court will appoint one for you.

478
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,364
<i>President Reynolds' office.</i>

479
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,824
This is Agent Paul Kellerman.

480
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,494
I need to speak with the president
right now, please.

481
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,747
<i>I'm sorry, this administration</i>
<i>isn't familiar with an Agent Kellerman.</i>

482
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:21,168
June, it's me.
I need to speak with Carolyn now.

483
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,170
If you don't put me through...

484
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,423
...I'll make certain the president knows
that you did not allow me...

485
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,843
...to provide her with some very
important information. Now.

486
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,681
<i>I'm sorry, this administration</i>
<i>isn't familiar with an Agent--</i>

487
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,612
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

488
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,698
Bill, don't do this.

489
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,035
<i>I've dedicated my life</i>
<i>to this country. To Carolyn.</i>

490
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,037
<i>Everything I have, I give.</i>

491
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,916
Every photo. Every file. Get rid of it all.

492
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:04,044
- Make him a ghost.
<i>- I've been a perfect soldier.</i>

493
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,047
<i>I've never asked anything of you ever.</i>

494
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,883
<i>But I'm asking now.</i>

495
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,219
<i>Bill, don't do this.</i>

496
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:21,728
- I don't see him.
- Trust me, we haven't lost him yet.

497
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,865
Linc, stop the car.

498
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,784
- What?
- We gotta stop the car.

499
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,126
That's a radio tower over there.

500
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,296
It must be picking up
some kind of analog signal.

501
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,299
We gotta get closer. Turn around.

502
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,720
- What about your friend back there?
- If we're gonna go down...

503
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,471
...might as well go down swinging.

504
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,275
All right.

505
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,485
Come on, come on, come on.

506
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,659
We are in business. It's going through.

507
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,328
All right.

508
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,080
Come on, Sara, pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

509
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,607
Sara.

510
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,381
<i>Hello?</i>

511
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,466
<i>Hello, Michael?</i>

512
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,720
<i>Michael?</i>
