1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,418
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:05,296
- The ranch is gone, Michael.
- We gotta do something.

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,674
- It's not gonna involve hurting anyone.
- I got an idea.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,886
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,721
Those cons are in one of these towns.

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,808
They couldn't have gone further
than 64 miles in any direction.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,643
I want everything in that perimeter.

8
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,314
You know, to be honest,
I was expecting to brief the president.

9
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,732
You report to me now.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,568
Frankly, the biggest
issue we have to address...

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,570
...are the charges
facing your daughter.

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,863
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>Sara, did you remember that</i>
<i>guy I met with you in your apartment?</i>

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,370
I want you to stay away from him.

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,415
- What are you talking about?
<i>- I found out some other things.</i>

16
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,252
- Where is that?
- Oh, it's Holland.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,920
It's beautiful.

18
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,215
Gas up the car. And we'll
meet you right back here in an hour.

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,925
Okay.

20
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,594
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

21
00:00:56,432 --> 00:01:00,393
- Ah! Oh, God.
- Don't say a word, you old whore.

22
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,062
Or I'm gonna cut your throat out.

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,444
You try that again, I'll pry those
vocal cords right out of your throat.

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,030
She's coming up.

25
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,785
What's she doing?

26
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,580
She's coming up here.

27
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,792
Stay there, stay there.

28
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,474
Hey, Mom, you home?

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,103
MICHAEL
Stay here. Stay quiet.

30
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,533
Mom?

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,960
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Back away and put your hands up.

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,586
- Just go easy.
- Go nothing.

33
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,880
She ain't the one
carrying the cards here.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,299
Back away and put your hands up.

35
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,886
I put my hand up,
I'm gonna take her jugular with it.

36
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,597
I don't want anyone
to do anything stupid, okay?

37
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,227
Don't move.

38
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,564
Let's be civil.

39
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,859
Stop, relax. Here you go.

40
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,028
Guy at the garden center
said Burrows was strong as a gorilla.

41
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,072
It was 1 p.m. when they tangled it up.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,157
Guy ID'd both of them.

43
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,451
Scofield, Burrows.
No doubt about it in his mind.

44
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,329
That was 1 p.m., they could be
300 miles from here by now.

45
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,624
You have picks, shovels and power tools
missing from that store.

46
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,293
They're here and they're digging.

47
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,546
Five million dollars buried somewhere
beneath the streets of Tooele.

48
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,756
- You really believe that?
- They believe that.

49
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,425
And that's the important thing.

50
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:41,512
They could be anywhere now. We don't
have the units to go door to door.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,806
And we won't need them.

52
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,101
He's gonna tell us where to look.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,605
It's so funny,
I was just about to text you.

54
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,690
- Today's your lucky day.
- Is it?

55
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:40,821
Yeah, my Aunt Maxine finally gave me
her famous chocolate-chip-cookie recipe.

56
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,034
And if you're free tonight,
I'd love for you to be my guinea pig.

57
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,161
I can't. Not tonight.

58
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,082
Come on. You sound just like Daniel,
"Not tonight. Not tonight."

59
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,709
You know what? If you don't mind,
I've actually gotta go.

60
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,711
Um...

61
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,673
Are you okay?
I mean, your cart's empty...

62
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,258
I'm good. Yeah, I just gotta go.

63
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,010
Sara...

64
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,944
This is going wrong
in every possible way.

65
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,862
This is stupid, man.
We cannot do this.

66
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,823
Hat's over the wall now.

67
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,450
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

68
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,495
I mean we committed.

69
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,997
It's time to go get the hat.

70
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,291
- We don't have a choice.
- Yeah, we do.

71
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,585
We can walk right up
out of here right now, man.

72
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,295
And then what?

73
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,382
We are already in the house.

74
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,385
Those women are bound.
We have already committed this crime.

75
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,971
We leave, it ain't gonna change
any of that.

76
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,729
Why couldn't there just be a silo in
the middle of a field with no one around?

77
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,691
We'll figure it out
and get the money another way.

78
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,527
Yeah, maybe I can rob another bank.

79
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,905
You know what Charles
once said to me?

80
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,701
He said there's no such thing
as an ex-con.

81
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:14,665
Because I used to think there was a way
we could wipe the slate clean.

82
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,169
Make up for everything we've done.

83
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,257
The hat's over the wall, Linc.

84
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,179
For everyone.

85
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,939
Sorry isn't gonna mean anything
to you right now.

86
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,400
But I wanna say it anyway.

87
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,113
This wasn't supposed to happen.

88
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,744
One or two hours, tops,
and we'll be out of here.

89
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,790
You have my word,
no one will harm you.

90
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,170
Keep your eyes open, okay?

91
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,131
Nothing happens to them.

92
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,092
Nothing.

93
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,981
The doctor is suspicious.

94
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,652
She should be. She was on the line
with the governor when you walked up.

95
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,153
You were listening.

96
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,781
<i>Both lines are tapped. We're not rookies.</i>

97
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,826
Did her father tell her what he found?

98
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,036
Not over the phone.

99
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,996
But he knows who you are.

100
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,999
<i>And so does she.</i>

101
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,753
Seeing how she was supposed
to lead you to Scofield and Burrows...

102
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,422
- ...we're back to square one.
- Not necessarily.

103
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,008
<i>- There are other people they care about.</i>
- The kid.

104
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,053
L.J.

105
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,850
- Now, in terms of the governor, Bill--
- The Burrows kid, Paul.

106
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,476
Focus.

107
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,779
Governor Tancredi's office, please hold.

108
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,907
- Governor Tancredi's office. Hold, please.
- Is my father in, Chris?

109
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,492
- Just a second.
- Okay.

110
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,536
- Governor Tancredi's office.
- Hey, Bruce.

111
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,371
- Oh, hi, Sara.
- I'm trying to get Dad.

112
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,707
- I need to reach him on his cell.
- He just landed.

113
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,958
- Should be home soon.
- Okay.

114
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,002
Don't know if
he'll be in a talking mood.

115
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,211
Why?

116
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,047
Your father got a call
from the White House.

117
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,591
They withdrew his nomination.

118
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,178
What? I talked to him two hours ago.
He didn't say anything about that.

119
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,473
It just happened. According to them, his
confirmation was going to be a problem.

120
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,853
- We had the votes, right?
- Super majority.

121
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,191
Okay, so President Reynolds
pulled the plug on a sure thing...

122
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,735
...in order to start over from scratch?

123
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,654
How often does something like that
happen in politics?

124
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,781
Never.

125
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,832
Since when did we become kidnappers?
It ain't right.

126
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,753
Well, we can buy a conscience
tomorrow.

127
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,506
Yeah, well, yeah, closing your eyes
ain't gonna make it go away.

128
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,928
I'll take five minutes
of a situation I can control...

129
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,098
...over 50 years of one I can't, any day.

130
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,100
Hey, Mr. Hundred Dollar Bill.

131
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,354
What's it like being with
the African persuasion, anyhow, huh?

132
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,941
- Yo, shut the hell up.
- Oh, hit me a nerve.

133
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,615
- Why don't you get in that hole and dig?
- How about you backing up, dark fella?

134
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,618
You're a long way away from home,
Trailer Park.

135
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,703
I can put you in that hole.

136
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,623
- And nobody would ever hear you scream.
- Knock it off.

137
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,959
<i>We have security expert</i>
<i>Mark Bruni with us...</i>

138
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,711
<i>...who will explain how other prisons</i>
<i>are ensuring...</i>

139
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,382
<i>...that they are not victimized</i>
<i>by the next Fox River Eight.</i>

140
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:57,304
Should be the Fox River Seven
now that Abruzzi's taken his dirt nap.

141
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,473
God rest the man's soul, of course.

142
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,977
Speaking of numbers, we're short one.

143
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,480
Kid's taking a long time
to fill that gas tank up.

144
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,450
I leaned on him
in every way I can think of.

145
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,661
He's not talking.

146
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,808
Are you Catholic?

147
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,983
Not much good in it. A lot of guilt.

148
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,322
But the one good thing is confession.

149
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:03,037
Whatever you got eating at you,
you just give it up.

150
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,248
Feels good, I have to say.

151
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,793
Guess it's letting it out.

152
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,840
- Letting another human being hear--
- I got nothing to say to you, man.

153
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,349
What if I told you something?

154
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,394
A secret nobody else knows.

155
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,357
Oscar Shales.

156
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:41,241
A guy I was chasing a few years back.

157
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,827
Smart as hell.

158
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,082
I kept just missing him.

159
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,960
It became kind of a game, like chess.

160
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,089
Would've been fun
if it weren't for the fact...

161
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,175
...that he were killing people
all along the way.

162
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:07,559
Bodies kept stacking up, and I started
to feel that it was because of me.

163
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,312
Because I couldn't do my job.

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,273
Because I wasn't smart enough.

165
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,280
Never did catch him.

166
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,449
But I did lose it.

167
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,414
Saw things when I would drive at night.

168
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,957
Bodies.

169
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,127
Nightmares to the point
that I couldn't sleep.

170
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,633
It was a complete break from reality.

171
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,596
That's what these little guys are for.

172
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,932
Keep me in the game.

173
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,983
So now you know.
Now it's off my chest.

174
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,485
Ought to try it sometime.

175
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,750
Like I said before...

176
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,087
...I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

177
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,631
You know where those guys are.

178
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,761
If you're looking for a rat,
you've got the wrong guy, man.

179
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,764
No, I'm just trying
to spare you some guilt.

180
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,441
Bagwell was free less than 24 hours
before he killed his first victim.

181
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,448
If you don't tell me where he is now,
he's gonna kill again.

182
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,535
And that blood is gonna be
on your conscience and nobody else's.

183
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,878
Confession might not be
such a bad thing, huh?

184
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,513
He just arrived, L.J.

185
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,056
That's impossible.

186
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,476
I don't have a meeting scheduled
with my lawyer.

187
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,397
He's a court-appointed public defender
in Illinois.

188
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,942
I doubt he would come to Arizona
without calling me.

189
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,610
Let's go.

190
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,433
Yeah?

191
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,103
We're all set
<i>in Arizona with the Burrows kid.</i>

192
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,479
Good.

193
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,731
<i>The kid's as good as gone.</i>

194
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,574
What'd you say the
name of that lawyer was?

195
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,326
Didn't give it to me.
Gave it to the warden.

196
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,121
Then I want to talk to
the warden. Hey, you hear me?

197
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,956
After.

198
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,359
Hello, L.J.

199
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,904
- What do you want?
- They didn't tell you why I came here?

200
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,656
No.

201
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,326
I'm an ADA here in Mojave County.

202
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,536
I'm here to serve you with these.

203
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,247
What are those?

204
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,207
Your release papers.

205
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,477
- Hey.
- Ms. Tancredi.

206
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,312
- Is my dad in?
- In the study.

207
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,314
Great, thank you.

208
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,069
Dad?

209
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,793
Help!

210
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,445
I need my pills.

211
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,699
Please, I need my pills.

212
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,623
- What?
- I need my pills.

213
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,251
- Forget it.
- No, you don't understand. I need them.

214
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,129
They're for my baby.

215
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,799
They're Metformin,
to prevent a miscarriage. Please.

216
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,386
They're in the drawer in the kitchen.

217
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,015
That one right there.

218
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,062
- How many?
- Two.

219
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,023
And water. Please.

220
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,127
- Now I gotta put the gag back on.
- Wait.

221
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,796
Before you do,
I just have one more question.

222
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,923
You seem like a really good guy.

223
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,593
Why are you doing this?

224
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,348
I'm not a good guy.

225
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,272
<i>And these changes, do you</i>
<i>really think they'll help keep predators...</i>

226
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,150
<i>...like Theodore Bagwell</i>
<i>safely behind bars?</i>

227
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,693
<i>Without a doubt.</i>

228
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,405
Picture makes me look like a sociopath.

229
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,078
I'm not joking with you, Trailer Park.
Now, get in here and dig.

230
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,499
I am incapable, thanks to all y'all.

231
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,836
Just remember, my X marked the spot!
You remember that.

232
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,214
We got a bigger issue. The kid.

233
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,634
- How long's it been since he left?
- An hour and a half, maybe.

234
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,262
An hour and a half to fill a tank of gas?
That ain't right.

235
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,139
There's been
<i>a breaking development...</i>

236
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,434
<i>...in the double-homicide prosecution</i>
<i>of Lincoln Burrows, Jr.</i>

237
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,187
<i>Due to the sudden disappearance</i>
<i>of crucial blood...</i>

238
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,481
Hey, Linc,
I didn't know you had a boy.

239
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,235
<i>- -the Cook County District Attorney's</i>
<i>Office had no choice...</i>

240
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:17,697
<i>...but to drop all charges</i>
<i>against the 16-year-old.</i>

241
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,950
<i>Burrows is scheduled to be released...</i>

242
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,786
<i>...from the Klipton Detention Center</i>
<i>in Kingman, Arizona...</i>

243
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,248
<i>...where he's currently being held,</i>
<i>tomorrow morning.</i>

244
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,046
Keys to her car. Where are they?

245
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,589
- Here.
- Just hold on, okay?

246
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,676
- You can't do this, Linc.
- Why not?

247
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,430
- We are five minutes away in there.
- We've been five minutes for four hours.

248
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,475
- Just give me some time. Be patient.
- You think I give a damn...

249
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,811
- ...about the money?
- I'm doing what's necessary.

250
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,856
You're afraid to fail.
You're afraid this plan ain't gonna work.

251
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,775
You wanna get caught proving
you can pull this off, be my guest.

252
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,610
L.J.'s out there. I'm gonna get him.

253
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,197
We have come 1500 miles
across country.

254
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,284
We have made it this far.

255
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,164
Then I guess this is where
we part ways.

256
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,957
- Any word on the interrogation?
- No, the kid's stonewalling.

257
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,918
But we've got confirmation
on Patoshik.

258
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,337
His prints were all over
that old lady's house.

259
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,839
So he leaves the cash and the jewelry.

260
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,259
The only thing he steals
is the $10 oil painting.

261
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,720
What the hell does he want with that?

262
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,036
Is there something I can help you with?

263
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,538
What? No.

264
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,959
You know, it'd be a little easier
if you used a cart for all that stuff.

265
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,377
I'm just...

266
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,255
I wanted to see if it all fit in the bag.

267
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,843
What happened to your knee there?

268
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,804
- Motorcycle accident.
- Oh.

269
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,307
So you don't move around
too well then, do you?

270
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,017
Not really.

271
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,728
- Well, that's good.
- Hey, hey. Hey!

272
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,709
You can still come with me.

273
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,711
No, I could...

274
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,423
I could do this.

275
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,052
- And if you can't?
- Then we still meet up.

276
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,680
- Exactly where we planned.
- Bullshai Booze.

277
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,349
- Bolshoi.
- Bolshoi.

278
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,226
L.J.'s gonna be with me.

279
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,230
- You remember how to get there?
- How can I forget?

280
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,442
Thursday night, 6:00.

281
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,444
It's our last shot.

282
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,322
If we're...

283
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,241
Um...

284
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,953
If we do this right, we're gone forever.

285
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,623
A lot of ground to cover in three days.

286
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,168
A lot of ground.

287
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,837
All right.

288
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,340
Take care.

289
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,719
They'll be gunning for you.

290
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,056
They'll get you
any way they can, so...

291
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,433
Yep.

292
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,814
Tell L.J... Tell him I said there'll be
a surfboard with his name on it.

293
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,984
Nice. Bolshoi Booze.

294
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,778
- Three days.
- Three days.

295
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,654
Keep your head down.

296
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,145
Ms. Tancredi.

297
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,398
Hi...

298
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,984
...I just want to let you know
that the M.A...

299
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,862
...she's finished her preliminary
examination of the body.

300
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,990
She found no signs of foul play.

301
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,994
I know it's a shock...

302
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,206
...but we've also spoken
to the detail guard stationed outside.

303
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,543
And he didn't see anyone, other
than your father, enter or exit...

304
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,920
...since he came back
from Washington.

305
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,214
My father's not a suicidal man.

306
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,263
Look, is there any extended family
I should call?

307
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,057
I'm an only child
and my mother passed away.

308
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,146
- Could I have a moment, please?
- Yeah.

309
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,555
That's a hell of a good deal, son.

310
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,601
I mean, we're talking no additional time
on your sentence for the escape.

311
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,604
You want it in writing,
I'll put it in writing.

312
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,314
We will put you up at Club Fed.

313
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,733
You'll spend your days
playing racquetball...

314
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,944
...with stockbrokers and lawyers.

315
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,114
Four years from now,
you'll be on the street.

316
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,409
Twenty-two years old,
with a clean slate...

317
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,411
...and your whole life ahead of you.

318
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,874
And no blood on your hands.

319
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,792
Okay?

320
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,924
There's a woman in the house.

321
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,305
If you guys show up...

322
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,018
...they're just gonna turn her
into a hostage.

323
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:07,523
T-Bag, he ain't coming out alive.

324
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,901
And he's gonna take her with him.

325
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,527
- Let me worry about that.
- Hm-mm.

326
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,322
No, hell, no.

327
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,826
The only way that
that woman comes out free...

328
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:23,581
...is if someone shows up
on that porch that they trust.

329
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,583
Being you.

330
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,921
Being me.

331
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,556
I'll take you to them.

332
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,126
Oh, you like...

333
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,878
You like jerky?

334
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,966
You like jerky.

335
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,682
What were you in for?

336
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,310
I don't want to talk, lady.

337
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,396
I'm a prisoner in my own house.

338
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,816
The least you could offer me
is a little conversation.

339
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,695
All right.

340
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,989
Just let me know when I hit it.

341
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,658
Murder. Rape.

342
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,953
Kidnapping. Sexual abuse.

343
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,790
- Child sexual abuse.
- Aggravated robbery.

344
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,003
- How long were you doing?
- Five years.

345
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,506
How much longer
did you have left to serve?

346
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,007
Eighteen months.

347
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,676
Why on earth would you break
out of prison with--?

348
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,476
What's her name?

349
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,354
Doesn't matter.

350
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,941
So, what? She was running away
with another man?

351
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,363
- You should've let her go instead of--
- She's having my baby.

352
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:06,035
- How far along is she?
- I don't want to talk about it.

353
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,622
I'm two months. I just had
my first-trimester sonogram on Tuesday.

354
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,166
<i>Ten-five. Dispatch to all units.</i>

355
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,377
- Has she shown you pictures of--?
- Shh!

356
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,880
<i>Transporting David Apolskis</i>
<i>in FBI custody. Stand by.</i>

357
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,225
Yo, this is gonna take all day.
We need more manpower.

358
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:33,062
Standing around and jabbering ain't
gonna get the dirt out of that ground.

359
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,730
All right, that's it.

360
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,067
You son of a bitch! Now what?

361
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,365
- We gotta roll.
- Why?

362
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,534
They got Tweener. It was on the radio.

363
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,205
Nice knowing y'all.

364
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,040
They say anything
about where we are?

365
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,084
I'm not hanging
around to find out.

366
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,257
Yo, maybe you should.

367
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,187
Maybe you should.

368
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,946
Maybe we all should.

369
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,134
Let's go over this again.
None of them were armed?

370
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,969
Guns? No.

371
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,473
Bagwell had a screwdriver
or something.

372
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,809
- Do we really need this, man?
- Yeah.

373
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:57,313
In case you decide to
do something stupid, like tip them off.

374
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,816
You don't have
a problem with that, do you?

375
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,029
Compass, check.

376
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,323
Map, check. Rope, check.

377
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,741
Okay.

378
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,374
I bet you're wondering what we're doing
down here by Lake Michigan, huh?

379
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:22,505
It's because if you go far enough
that way, you get to the ocean.

380
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,341
You know what's out there.

381
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,762
Holland.

382
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,852
We're gonna live in a windmill.

383
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,772
All we need is a raft.

384
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,693
I'm gonna build it.

385
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,321
All starts with this...

386
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,657
No, this stick.

387
00:31:55,706 --> 00:32:01,377
Charles Westmoreland, God bless
you and your wrinkled old sack.

388
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,546
It's all here.

389
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,881
I owe you a profound thanks, Pretty.

390
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,593
Couple of days from now...

391
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,138
...I'm gonna be walking the streets
of Bangkok with a million U.S.

392
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,141
That's about 40 million baht
in the local currency.

393
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,935
What the hell is up with you
and Thailand, huh?

394
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,689
Black-market surgery,
anonymous transplant donors.

395
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,942
Hes dressed like shes.
What's there not to like?

396
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,612
Are you really gonna try
to replace that hand?

397
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,989
Body ain't taking to this one.

398
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,830
- Unbelievable.
- All right, let's move.

399
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,916
You know, that hand
ain't gonna be white.

400
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,377
- What?
- The new one.

401
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:47,173
Even if you get down there,
it ain't gonna be white.

402
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,926
Hey, Johnny KKK over here's
gonna have an Asian hand.

403
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,946
No mistakes. Let's get them clean.

404
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,625
I need to know if I can trust you.

405
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,293
<i>They're escaping.</i>

406
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,878
<i>No, you can't leave me here.</i>

407
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,963
<i>- Not like this.</i>
- We had a deal.

408
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,965
Now walk.

409
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,933
- Scott.
- I don't got much time, all right?

410
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,310
<i>I had to tell you something.</i>

411
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,021
What you did for me
that day at the motel...

412
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,068
Ain't nobody in my life
that's been to bat for me like that.

413
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,280
- Get him. Go, go, go!
- And I lied to you, okay?

414
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,367
My name ain't Scott.

415
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,369
- My name's Dave.
- Oh, my God.

416
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,538
- David Apolskis.
- Go now, go!

417
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,915
- Get away from the door!
- Get down. Now!

418
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,126
- Put your hands on your head!
- And I just...

419
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,544
Put him in the car.

420
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,048
I wanted you to know, all right,
I'm gonna be writing to you.

421
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,427
And I sure as hell hope
that you write back.

422
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,180
All clear!

423
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,240
<i>Can I help you?</i>

424
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,785
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

425
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,246
Contractor. Got some electrical issues.

426
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,749
No, you can't help me.

427
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,250
Excuse me, is there a problem?

428
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,587
- Ms. Owens?
- She's not home.

429
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,423
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to drive her
to the club for--

430
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,925
She already went to the club.

431
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,429
Yeah, she came out,
said she was going to the club.

432
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,847
She got in her car and left.

433
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,684
I don't know what else to tell you.

434
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,772
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

435
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,796
He's gone, but we gotta get out of here,
because once he gets to the club...

436
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:17,591
...he's gonna find out she's not there
and he's gonna be back.

437
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,140
You know what? You were right.

438
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,310
It does feel good
to get stuff off your chest.

439
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:32,064
I'm sorry I had to
play you like that, bro.

440
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,199
Yo, what's up?

441
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,829
Come on. It's gonna be a long drive.

442
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,289
Stretch your legs.

443
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,438
All right.

444
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,622
<i>I thought you were gonna deal...</i>

445
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,540
<i>...with the L.J. Burrows situation.</i>

446
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,417
Oh, I did.

447
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,461
Then why is he being released
from custody?

448
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,380
In and of himself,
the kid is useless to us.

449
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:42,134
His only value
is in who comes looking for him.

450
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,470
More importantly, Bill.

451
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,765
<i>Governor Tancredi. Not part of our plan.</i>

452
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,851
Last time I checked, you left
no shortage of bodies in your wake.

453
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,688
No, I did what I had to do
to get Carolyn where she is.

454
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,359
Now that she's there, let's not draw
any more attention than we have to.

455
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,903
<i>You think getting to the top</i>
<i>is the hard part?</i>

456
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:04,281
She's a hundred times more visible.
Has a hundred times more enemies.

457
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,784
<i>Anyone who knows anything</i>
<i>has got to be dealt with.</i>

458
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,828
If someone is a liability, they go.

459
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,706
Tancredi was becoming a liability.

460
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,502
So is his daughter.

461
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,545
Wait. What?

462
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,255
<i>Sara?</i>

463
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,009
Goodbye, Paul.

464
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,223
You walk out with those guys now...

465
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,560
...it's only a matter of time
before you get caught. You realize that?

466
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,687
You're not just dealing
with escape charges.

467
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,814
Assault, unlawful imprisonment,
kidnapping--

468
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,774
- I don't need to hear this.
- No, you do.

469
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:24,361
How much longer do you really think
you can stay ahead of the cops?

470
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,199
Look, if you turn yourself in...

471
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,411
...I will testify at the sentencing,
I will say that you cooperated.

472
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,329
- That can make a difference.
- Shut up.

473
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,748
Be smart.

474
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:39,209
You have a baby on the way.
Wanna be around for its second birthday?

475
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,961
- Or its 22nd?
- Shut up.

476
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,630
If you didn't wanna hear
what a big mistake you were making...

477
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,340
...you would've put that gag back on--

478
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,183
Fernando! It's time to go!

479
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:58,812
You can still do the right thing,
Fernando.

480
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,861
Hey, looky here.

481
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,197
Looky here.

482
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:12,242
Pocket change, in case you wanna
tip the valet when you're at the Ritz.

483
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,204
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, boy. Where's Sucre?

484
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,748
Right here.

485
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,626
What are you doing?

486
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,252
Drop the bag.

487
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,630
No one's going anywhere.

488
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,315
Hey, yo.

489
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,402
Just so you know, man,
I'm not gonna roll on those guys.

490
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:51,198
It ain't gonna happen,
so if that's what this is about...

491
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,789
We were talking
about confession earlier.

492
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,584
And...

493
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,757
I think I owe you an apology
because I lied to you...

494
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,553
...about Oscar Shales.

495
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,810
Smart-ass just kept pushing it.

496
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,688
I snapped.

497
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,816
Right there.

498
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,319
That's where I put the bullet in him.

499
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,078
I don't care about none of this.

500
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:42,457
Mistake about that is that forensics
will tell the whole tale.

501
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,920
Powder burns.
The gun was right against his head.

502
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,091
Sir...

503
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,261
- We should go back--
- That's what's good about confession.

504
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,930
Because you say something,
you get it off your chest...

505
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,558
...and it just goes out there
into the whole world.

506
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,477
I'm so sorry about this, kid,
because I hope you understand.

507
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,314
- Yo, yo, hold on--
- I got nothing against you, kid.

508
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,692
