00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,752
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,672
Welcome home, boss.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,342
- Where's Mommy?
- Mommy's gonna meet us later, okay?

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,346
- I'm not a murderer.
- Terrence Steadman.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,556
- The president's brother.
- I didn't do it.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,019
- Mr. Steadman, it's contraband.
- I brought it to protect myself.

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,604
That's what we're here for.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,981
Can I write a check?
Because I don't have--

9
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,442
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,111
Teddy's home.

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,279
It's Pam. What's going on?

12
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,449
I love you. Give Cam
a kiss for me, okay?

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,993
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,161
You want my help.

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,913
- I want my job back.
- What's your plan?

16
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,791
When those brothers get in the van,
be the last thing they ever do.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,086
Paul Kellerman is ready to move on
the caravan outside of Albuquerque.

18
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,755
<i>When it goes down,</i>
<i>there'll be lots of bullets flying.</i>

19
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,633
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

20
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,301
Whoa.

21
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,017
President Reynolds ruined your life...

22
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,562
...she ruined my life.
You wanna take the bitch down...

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,398
...you found your inside man.
But it's gotta be right now.

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,108
Let's go.

25
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,500
I know the way out.

26
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,315
I want a team flanking the west.

27
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,859
Give me another team
down by the river.

28
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,203
Man down. Give me a Medivac, ASAP.

29
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,337
Officer Tuggle.

30
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,633
Officer Tuggle?

31
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,429
I'm looking for Alexander Mahone.
I'm his direct supervisor.

32
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,475
I'm sorry to tell you this, sir,
but your boy's been shot.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,983
Who are you?

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,735
I used to work for the president.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,529
Why are you helping us?

36
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,574
Lay down on the floor. Now.

37
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,929
Federal agent. Let me through.

38
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:05,226
Air support is telling us that they saw
your vehicle traveling down Route 46.

39
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:09,605
Forty-six is a possible exit route
for the convicts. I was securing it.

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,650
No offense, sir,
but we're searching every vehicle.

41
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,820
No offense. Either you let me through
or you get me a supervisor.

42
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,197
I'm supervising this roadblock,
Agent Kellerman.

43
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,075
I'm sorry, but I need you
to get out of the vehicle.

44
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,203
Sergeant, uh, Humphries.

45
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,832
Burrows and Scofield
have been loose for less than 10 minutes.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,210
That means every second is critical.
So if you detain me...

47
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,297
...for one moment more,
I will have all of your jobs.

48
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,007
Do you understand me?

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,594
- Go ahead.
- What?

50
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,971
Just let him go.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,911
You still haven't answered my question.

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,621
Why am I helping you?

53
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,916
Because the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

54
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,295
You said something about taking down
the president. I assume you have a plan.

55
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,213
I do.

56
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,675
I used to have a Great Dane.
We had to put her down.

57
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,093
It was very peaceful.

58
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,639
Shh. One minute she
was breathing, the next she wasn't.

59
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,353
Turn around.

60
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,789
Get up.

61
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,794
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't blow your brains out.

62
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,255
Because I can give you
the one thing that's gonna set you free.

63
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,257
I know where Terrence Steadman is.

64
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,968
How do you know
where Steadman is?

65
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,970
Because I arranged this whole thing.

66
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,763
- You arranged to set me up?
- Right.

67
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,599
You arranged the killing
of all the people I know.

68
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,019
I was given orders.
I executed those orders.

69
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,105
And now I have a bull's-eye
on my chest, just like you two.

70
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,483
- I don't trust him.
- Hey.

71
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,866
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

72
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,869
You guys want to keep running, fine.

73
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,621
You wanna be free, get in the car.

74
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,874
Last time I'm gonna offer.

75
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,986
What's up, fish?

76
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,451
Looks like you're having
a tough time of it.

77
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,996
- I'm all right.
- Well, I'm just curious.

78
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,751
Why don't you hang out with the rest
of the ex-guards who are locked up here?

79
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,837
Oh, yeah.

80
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,589
There ain't any.

81
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,382
It's just you.

82
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,765
Hey, hold. Hold up, hold up.

83
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:17,144
Now, I got what's called a mutual
beneficial arrangement in my mind.

84
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,397
I'll look out after you.
Make sure nobody get up in your mix.

85
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,401
And all you got to do is bring me
your dessert after the next meal.

86
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,320
It's real simple.

87
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,240
I'm just looking to do my time.
I don't want any trouble.

88
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,952
Yeah. It's what you want,
and it's what I want.

89
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,747
Your dessert after the next chow.

90
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,999
You bring it to me. You got it?

91
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,710
No. Wrong guy.

92
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,297
Hey. Break it up, convicts.

93
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,134
We're good, boss.
We're good.

94
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,597
You bring me my treat...

95
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,683
...or this goes to the next level.

96
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,435
Do you understand?

97
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,565
He asked you a question, boy.

98
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,611
Yeah.

99
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,906
- I ain't hear him. You?
- I ain't hear him.

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,908
Yeah. Okay.

101
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,451
See how easy that was?

102
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,873
We're gonna be good friends now.

103
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,020
There's no reason for you to be scared,
Suzie Q...

104
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,357
...because, you see, I've forgiven you.

105
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:50,487
And you, in turn, can forgive me
for my indiscretions...

106
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,072
...which are so far in the past...

107
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,118
...they're nothing
but specks in our respective rear views.

108
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,873
It's been such a long time.

109
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,043
You look lovely.

110
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:12,051
Okay, let's go. Right now.
We can go away.

111
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,928
Spend some time together.

112
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,389
Susan, I'm not a Victrola,
so please don't play me like one.

113
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,850
There's not a white man's chance
in Harlem...

114
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,269
...you'd ever leave
your children behind.

115
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,397
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,107
Don't fret, now.

117
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,612
When you came to Fox River...

118
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,616
...and you spat at me
like I was some kind of...

119
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,826
...rabid animal.

120
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,540
I was happy...

121
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,545
...because such a visceral reaction could
only come from a woman who still cares.

122
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,301
The children don't know.
I didn't wanna scare them...

123
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,012
...so I never told them about you,
so please don't--

124
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,099
That is so perfect.

125
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,896
Because you see what we got
here now?

126
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,151
We got ourselves a clean slate.

127
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,904
Right?

128
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,288
So this is the conspiracy, huh?

129
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,500
A bunch of little boys in suits
running around trying to kill each other?

130
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,711
It's pathetic.

131
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,755
Well, you were a little more
formidable than we anticipated.

132
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,341
We don't need compliments
out of you, jackass.

133
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,343
Oh, yes, there it is.

134
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,179
- The winning Burrows personality.
- Shut your mouth and drive.

135
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,141
The one we really knew would
win over a jury. Good work.

136
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,773
Mr. Kim.

137
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,526
What the hell is going on out there?

138
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,445
<i>It was touch-and-go for a minute...</i>

139
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,030
...but I got everything handled.

140
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,614
<i>Mahone's been shot.</i>

141
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,035
Yes, I know, Bill, I was there.
I saw Burrows pull the trigger.

142
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,871
<i>- We lost a valuable asset, but--</i>
- Mahone's alive.

143
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,044
That's good. It looked bad, so.

144
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,712
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

145
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,630
Burrows and Scofield are dead.

146
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,051
And they're in my SUV.
I'm heading out to bury them right now.

147
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,178
Don't bury them.

148
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,972
I need visual confirmation.

149
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,226
- I'll get you a photo.
- I'll say it one more time.

150
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,730
- Don't bury them.
<i>- You know what would be nice to hear?</i>

151
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,523
A thank you.

152
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,318
I'll report back
when they're in the ground.

153
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,905
You leave that on, they'll trace it.

154
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:41,909
Yeah, uh, Secret Service.
It's untraceable, but thanks.

155
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,553
Hey, baby girl.

156
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,518
What?

157
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,019
What's the matter?

158
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,523
- Where's Mommy?
- Oh, come on.

159
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,401
Now, I told you that Mommy
was helping a friend.

160
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,569
All right? Now, we're gonna
see her real soon.

161
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,113
When?

162
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,742
Baby, we are gonna be
with your mommy real soon.

163
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,620
I promise you that. Okay?

164
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,289
I don't believe you.

165
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,422
Dede. Dede.

166
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,598
<i>Yo, Trey. It's me, man.</i>

167
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,309
- What's up?
<i>- Yo, what's going on with Kacee?</i>

168
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,812
I'm at the courthouse.
She's getting arraigned soon.

169
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,981
Okay. Well, you talk to her?
Is she all right?

170
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,651
She's in jail, so, no, she's not all right.
What the hell happened?

171
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,654
- You think I wanted it this way?
<i>- Whatever.</i>

172
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,948
Gotta go.
My lawyer's gonna be here any minute.

173
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,783
No, no. Listen, listen.

174
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,579
Now, look, I want you to tell Kacee
to put it all on me, all right?

175
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,166
And she didn't know what to do.
She was scared. Okay? All that.

176
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,418
Yeah, I already told her to do that.

177
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,851
I'll do the talking.

178
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,519
- Owen Kravecki? Hey.
- That's me.

179
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,438
Hey. Ben and Phil.

180
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,317
Let's go, before our wives
figure out this is a fishing trip.

181
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,195
- Where's your gear?
- I keep it up north. Okay?

182
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,946
How long is the flight?

183
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,698
An hour, 40.

184
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,590
We don't have a choice.

185
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,942
Glad you're awake.

186
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,070
Collarbone and rotator cuff.

187
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,447
Six inches to the right,
and you're dead.

188
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,574
Yeah, he just woke up.

189
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,127
<i>Mr. Mahone.</i>

190
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,838
Bill Kim. You're a lucky man.

191
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,758
- Am I?
<i>- Kellerman finished the job you couldn't.</i>

192
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,470
But he, unfortunately,
is still out there...

193
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,430
...and he's a loose end.

194
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,267
Finish what you were supposed
to take care of.

195
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>Something funny?</i>

196
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,482
Kellerman's more of a loose end
than you realize.

197
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,150
He shot me.

198
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:07,155
<i>The guy you wanted to double-cross</i>
<i>screwed you first.</i>

199
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,574
Scofield and Burrows?

200
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,410
Are probably alive...

201
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,453
...and on the run with Kellerman.

202
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,042
Have a good day, Kimmy.

203
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,508
We neutered Kellerman.

204
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,760
He doesn't even officially exist
anymore.

205
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,890
He knows everything.

206
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,820
<i>Reports have been coming in</i>
<i>from New Mexico officials...</i>

207
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,032
<i>...that escaped convicts</i>
<i>Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows...</i>

208
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,909
<i>...have somehow managed</i>
<i>to extricate themselves...</i>

209
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,705
<i>...from a transport van that was bringing</i>
<i>them back to the Chicago area.</i>

210
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,541
<i>According to this early information,</i>
<i>the convicts were...</i>

211
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,293
You're great.

212
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,630
Top-notch. I swear to God.

213
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,257
Don't get yourself worked up,
Mr. Steadman.

214
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,719
I was supposed to have my life
back by now.

215
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,474
Playing golf, going to movies...

216
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,603
...seeing people. But because
you guys can't get a handle...

217
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,314
...on an engineer and a petty crook...

218
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,942
...I've been a ship in a bottle
for over three years.

219
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,819
You're perfectly safe here.

220
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,946
Mm.

221
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,994
I wish.

222
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,709
I just spoke to Kim.

223
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,837
He wants you to finish the job.

224
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,174
Yeah? Well,
That's not gonna happen.

225
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,009
This isn't a request.

226
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,804
And this isn't a negotiation.

227
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,516
Kim and Kellerman
can try to kill each other all day long.

228
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,977
But I'm out.

229
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,106
You must've forgotten how discreet
we've been with what we know.

230
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,233
Go tell the world about Shales.
In fact, I will.

231
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,194
I killed a predator, a man who
tortured and raped women...

232
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,114
...and I buried him in my back yard.
I'll do the time.

233
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,199
I don't care anymore. I'm out.

234
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,743
Is that clear enough for you?

235
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,572
My man.

236
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,705
Mm.

237
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,790
That's delicious.

238
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,419
Whoa, hold up there. Hold, hold up.

239
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,588
We got a problem.

240
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,132
That's one brownie.

241
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,176
There's five of my boys.

242
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,721
You see the position you put me in?

243
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,683
They gotta stand with their stomachs
growling while I savor this delicious treat.

244
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:25,479
That makes me look like a real ass.

245
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,360
Are you trying to make me
look like an ass?

246
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,697
You said the deal was I was supposed
to bring you one dessert.

247
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,908
Yeah. Well.

248
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm a fickle bitch.

249
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,287
Now it's five desserts...

250
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,164
...every meal.

251
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,794
Now, if you can't come up with that...

252
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,507
...there are other ways
to making me happy.

253
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,885
Well, I got some other candy on me,
if you want some of that.

254
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, break it out, bitch.
It's all good. You all want some candy?

255
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,732
Guard's coming.

256
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,003
If memory serves, I was at
Storytime Village that day too.

257
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,005
And I'm not in any of these pictures?

258
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,424
Could've sworn I was.

259
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,177
I'm just teasing, baby.

260
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,639
Every woman has burned
the photographs of her paramour...

261
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,602
...only to later realize her love burns
even hotter than the flames she used.

262
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,275
Please.

263
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,991
Teddy.

264
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,617
Uncle Teddy.

265
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,745
Oh! How's my girl been?

266
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,997
Good.

267
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,416
You still getting more A's
than an aardvark?

268
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,086
- Yeah. I missed you.
- Oh, same here, shortcake.

269
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,588
Yes, I painted my hair.

270
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,173
Look at you, Zack.

271
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,302
Mm. You are a boy no more.

272
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,721
I'm gonna have to lend you
my razor soon enough.

273
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,475
What are you doing here?
Mom said you got a job on an oil rig.

274
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,730
That's right. Right out
in the middle of the ocean.

275
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,482
But those metallic beasts
are dangerous.

276
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,109
Got myself injured.

277
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,987
Don't be, don't be frightened now, sugar.

278
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,698
The good lawyers at Dewey,
Cheatem and Howe...

279
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:46,453
...got me a million bones
for every digit I lost.

280
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,204
Five million dollars?

281
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,627
Which means with all that cash...

282
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,047
...I can do anything I want now.
And all I want to do...

283
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,216
...is spend all my money
and all my time...

284
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,677
...with you.

285
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,359
What's the neighborhood like?

286
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,736
No neighborhood.
The house sits on 50 acres.

287
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,279
We coming out the way we go in?

288
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,031
No. There's a back road we'll take.

289
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,116
- How many guards?
- Usually none.

290
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,953
At this point, I really couldn't tell you.

291
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,956
The second I feel this thing going bad...

292
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,041
...you get a bullet in the head.

293
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,170
I'd expect nothing less.

294
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,007
I will inform you every half-hour.

295
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,550
Understood.

296
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,261
Private jet was chartered
by Owen Kravecki this morning.

297
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,514
- Headed where?
- Montana.

298
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,849
Stop it from taking off.

299
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,352
It's already on the ground, sir.

300
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,020
Call Steadman.

301
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,070
If that's my sister,
I would like to speak to her.

302
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,408
Yes?

303
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,867
Mm-hm.

304
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,663
Right away, sir.

305
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,290
Evac.

306
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,835
Mr. Steadman, do you have a jacket?
We need to leave.

307
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,795
Leave? What? No.

308
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,840
Agents'll be arriving shortly
to take you to a safe house.

309
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,301
- What do I need to be kept safe from?
- Do you have a jacket, sir?

310
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,430
I don't wanna leave.
I wanna talk to my sister.

311
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,016
I've been authorized to use force
if necessary.

312
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,101
Now, is there anything you'd like
to bring?

313
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,232
My meds.

314
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,695
Go with him. Car's here in five minutes.

315
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,369
Well, I don't know, Stella.
She won't come out.

316
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,789
Who wants to be up in the trailer
all day, huh? Would you?

317
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,417
Exactly. Me, neither.

318
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,919
You feel like making a pie
or something?

319
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,464
A little cherry, or lemon meringue, or--

320
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,132
Daddy.

321
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,969
Is Mommy in trouble, like you?

322
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,144
Um. Sweetheart, come here.

323
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,521
Come here.

324
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,819
Now, you listen to me, okay?

325
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,364
Mommy did nothing wrong.

326
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,076
She's helping out a friend.

327
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,912
Okay?

328
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,376
Okay, let me go see how Mommy's doing,
all right?

329
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,170
- I wanna talk to her.
- No, no, no.

330
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,589
You sit here
like a good little girl, okay?

331
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,008
Don't give me that.

332
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,469
- Hello.
<i>- Things are looking up.</i>

333
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,639
Ah, that's what I wanted to hear.
Kick it down to me.

334
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,309
Her lawyer knows what he's doing.
He thinks he can get the bail reduced.

335
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>Good. All right, well, listen.</i>
<i>When Kacee gets out...</i>

336
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,273
...I want you to deliver
this message for me, okay?

337
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,317
Tell her...

338
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,027
...that we can all get lost.

339
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,321
You want her to jump bail now?

340
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,783
Be glad you ain't in front of my face,
I'd have my hands around your neck.

341
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,451
Punk, just deliver the message.

342
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,037
Okay. Then what you all gonna do?
Go live in a cave?

343
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,624
- I got a plan, all right?
- Let's hear it.

344
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,920
This guy back in my unit...

345
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,005
...when I was in Iraq.

346
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,551
He used to go to Alaska,
work at these fish hatcheries, man.

347
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,885
They pay you cash.

348
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,638
- And nobody asks questions.
<i>- Alaska?</i>

349
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,058
<i>Yeah, Alaska, man.</i>
<i>They don't bother you up there, man.</i>

350
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,478
You know, me, Kacee and Dede,
we could be a family again. You feel me?

351
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,896
Man, you don't quit.

352
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,107
You're damned straight I don't quit.

353
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,986
Do I get to know where I'm going?

354
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,572
You'll get all the information
you need upon arrival.

355
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,159
- Yes?
- Move Steadman to Location Beta.

356
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,577
We're sending a car.

357
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,537
It's already here, sir.

358
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,456
Couldn't be.

359
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,041
The car just left.

360
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,129
Weapons down.

361
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,965
Now.

362
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,099
Down.

363
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,726
Put your weapons down.

364
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,565
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get stupid.

365
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,775
Put your weapons down on the ground.
Now.

366
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,112
Terrence, step away. Get in the car.

367
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,324
You look pretty good for a dead man.

368
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,117
- Get in the car.
- Wait, wait, wait.

369
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,536
- Who's there?
- It's Kellerman. He's got Steadman.

370
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,914
Do not let him escape.

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,210
Kill Steadman. Kill them all, now.

372
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,761
- Paul, please. Don't-- Don't kill me.
- Get in. Get in the car!

373
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,517
Let's go.

374
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,241
Vomiting. It's the worst side effect
of anesthesia.

375
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,619
That should be the last of it.

376
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,372
- You figure I'm on empty by now?
- Yeah.

377
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,380
Pam.

378
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,925
Alex, Cameron's been hurt.

379
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,678
- What happened?
- It was a car. Hit and run.

380
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,973
He's in the hospital.
His leg is broken in two places.

381
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,016
I'll be on the next flight to Colorado.

382
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,852
<i>- He's in surgery now.</i>
- I'll be right there. Just hold on.

383
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,188
They won't let me seem him.
They called me.

384
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,565
I got right here
and they won't let me see him.

385
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,152
Pam, please, just keep it together
until I get there. Can you do that for me?

386
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,363
Please. Please hurry.

387
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,657
Mr. Mahone, you cannot get on a plane.

388
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,368
You need to stay at least another day
for observation.

389
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,828
You've been shot.

390
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,038
Mr. Mahone, please.

391
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,583
- I've gotta go see my son.
- Mr. Mahone, I understand.

392
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,877
Please. At least stay and talk to a doctor.

393
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,588
Taxi. Taxi.

394
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,053
How's your boy?

395
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,056
Tib-fib fractures are bad.

396
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,643
But if the growth plate's affected,
there's a whole host of problems.

397
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,354
- You made a mistake.
- No, you did.

398
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,232
You think you can just quit
like you work at a post office?

399
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,235
Now, you're needed back in.

400
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,611
Go clean up your mess.

401
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,991
Maybe there won't be another accident
on the streets of Durango, Colorado.

402
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,287
Understand?

403
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,839
Every road shut down.
Every car searched.

404
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,468
I don't care if it's a group of nuns.
Their camper gets turned inside out.

405
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,804
- Logistically speaking, every road's gon--
- It's Montana.

406
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,681
Not Manhattan.

407
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,642
- Get it done.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,776
If we get a camera, we can take
a picture of him holding a newspaper.

409
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,153
If we put that online,
that'll prove he's alive.

410
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,155
It'll prove that we found a guy...

411
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,366
...that looks kind of like
the president's brother.

412
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,951
- Fingerprints. Dental records.
- We whitewashed him.

413
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,579
We pulled his teeth,
burned off his fingerprints.

414
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,789
DNA.

415
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,208
To compare
against the homeless guy...

416
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,918
...we killed
and put in Steadman's car.

417
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,836
But we destroyed
all exterior DNA samples...

418
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,381
...so that there'd be nothing
to compare them to.

419
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,342
There's gotta be someone somewhere
who can identify this man.

420
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,052
Which is why we did the surgery.

421
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,680
Cheekbones raised two centimeters,
ears lowered a quarter of an inch.

422
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,183
Not so much that someone
wouldn't recognize him...

423
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,561
...enough that any forensic comparison
of a photograph of that man...

424
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,772
...would conclude
that he is a look-alike.

425
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,982
A hoax. Trust me.

426
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,693
We are very good at what we do.

427
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,198
Please, just let me go.

428
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,245
Terrence, you made every man
in this room a prisoner, including yourself.

429
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,832
- It's time to set us free.
- Nothing you do will work.

430
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,627
- They will not let it--
- Cut the victim act, Terrence.

431
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,380
He was happy to play along
when he was lining his pockets...

432
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,258
...with taxpayer money funneled
through EcoField. And then...

433
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,552
...when the indictment
is about to fall...

434
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,096
...who do you come running to for help,
Terrence? Hm?

435
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:33,187
We'll stay here for a day or two until
they think we're a thousand miles away.

436
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,565
And then we're gonna make our way
to D.C.

437
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,191
Okay?

438
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,905
So that's the plan? We take him to a city
crawling with Company and Feds?

439
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:47,410
And government agents still in power
working from the inside with your father.

440
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:51,747
People who can get that pain in the ass
to safely tell his story on the record.

441
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,334
We just stroll right into the lion's den
then, huh? Pray we don't get mauled.

442
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,213
I don't think they're gonna come to
Montana, so we're gonna go to them.

443
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,426
<i>No. Leave her alone.</i>

444
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:07,680
<i>- What do you want with her?</i>
<i>- What I want is to date her.</i>

445
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,348
<i>What do you want...?</i>

446
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,687
- I'll make you some more popcorn.
- Honey.

447
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,941
If any of us could eat any more corn,
I'd be amazed.

448
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,401
See what I did there, Gracey?

449
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,989
Indian word for corn is "maize,"
and I just said, "amazed."

450
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,910
I don't get it. I'm corn-fused.

451
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,537
Oh! You are smarter than a bee sting.

452
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,291
The second female president
of these United States, right here...

453
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,502
...watching TV with us.

454
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,923
- Oh.
- Look what I did.

455
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,300
- Honey, that's all right.
- No, I'll get a rag.

456
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,801
No, I can--

457
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,310
I thought
we had wiped the slate clean.

458
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,897
Please.

459
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,817
I thought we had put the past
where it belonged.

460
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,904
We did. We did put the past
where it belonged.

461
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:09,325
Do not...
Do not lie to me, woman.

462
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,702
After turn-coating me
to the authorities...

463
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:15,498
...and everything we had. After breaking
my heart into so many pieces...

464
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,835
...that I will never be able to find them all,
you can at least do me the favor...

465
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,713
...as to not stand there
and lie to my face.

466
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,340
Mom?

467
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,842
Zack, you get your ass
back on that couch!

468
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,471
Get Gracey. Go.

469
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,181
Give that to me.

470
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,858
I gave you all a chance.

471
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,861
Remember that.

472
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,057
Open up 22.

473
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,393
Opening 22.

474
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,440
Dude, you're crazy.

475
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,358
Is that what the other cons are saying?

476
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,235
- Yeah.
- Good.

477
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,905
But you took it to Banks. I don't think
you wanna be messing with him, man.

478
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,451
I'll mess with anybody tries
to punk me out.

479
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:37,413
Hey, you know
I've just been testing you.

480
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,416
Yeah, well,
the test results came back...

481
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,418
...and top bunk's mine now.

482
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,712
You got a problem with that?

483
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,768
- Hey, what's up, Stolte?
- You just screwed up, Brad. Big time.

484
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,979
No. I had a message to send,
and that message got delivered.

485
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,565
The guy you schlocked, Banks.

486
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,235
He's got connections with the guards
working nights.

487
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,782
Word is, Banks is gonna have you
pulled out of your cell tonight.

488
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,284
- Well, can't you do nothing?
- Yeah.

489
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,287
I can warn you,
which is what I'm doing.

490
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,706
Can't you talk to some
of the guys working nights?

491
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,459
They're working nights
because you put them on nights.

492
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,544
You should've treated them better.

493
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,463
They ain't gonna do you any favors.

494
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,049
Well, I treated you right, didn't I?

495
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,801
Come on, Stolte.

496
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,178
Can't you do something? Please.

497
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,263
You did treat me right...

498
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,599
...but there is nothing I can do now...

499
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,643
...except warn you...

500
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,895
...watch your back.

501
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,156
We can use the roads that the
rangers use in Glacier National Park.

502
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:58,661
They don't patrol them at night. Up into
Canada, head east. Through New York.

503
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:03,082
And the borders won't be a problem.
No, nobody'll look for us there.

504
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,794
- This fun for you, Terrence? Really?
- No, this isn't fun.

505
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,630
What was fun was when Caroline
and I would talk about you...

506
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,591
...and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

507
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,427
He proposed to her.

508
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,767
You thought that you would be the
first husband? The Serf who would be king?

509
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,477
Caroline.

510
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,354
We laughed so hard--

511
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,442
You stood and
watched them kill Veronica.

512
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,610
- Burrows.
- And you did nothing.

513
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,529
- Burrows.
- She died because of you.

514
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,248
Linc--
- Shut up!

515
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,043
Burrows, he has no value to us dead.
He has no identity.

516
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,671
- Kill him, he's just a John Doe.
- Put your gun down.

517
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,048
- When he puts his down.
- Linc, we're so close.

518
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,219
Was it worth it?
Killing those people? Ruining my life?

519
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,181
- Get a handle on your brother.
- Shut up. You're not helping.

520
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,974
Linc, you don't want to do this.

521
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,601
Trust me.

522
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,186
This isn't what you want.

523
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:09,231
You don't want to do this, okay?
Trust me.

524
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,793
So many people dead.

525
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,171
And he gets to live.

526
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,012
Hello? Hello?

527
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,597
They denied bail.

528
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,391
- What?
- The judge didn't buy that it was all you.

529
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,227
Kacee's going into the system now.

530
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,230
Aiding an escaped con.
She's looking at major time, man.

531
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,108
All right, uh...

532
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,988
Uh...

533
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:04,578
I want you to tell her lawyer, all right,
you listen to me. You tell her lawyer...

534
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,833
<i>I love you.</i>

535
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,127
- ...tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in, okay?
<i>- No.</i>

536
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,629
Kacee says you need to run.

537
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,632
If you turn yourself in,
Dede won't have either of you.

538
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,134
<i>And they'll just throw her</i>
<i>into foster care.</i>

539
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,137
<i>Look, I'm gonna hang up</i>
<i>this phone right now...</i>

540
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,390
...because I might say something
I'll regret.

541
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,683
Yo--

542
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,060
You just take care of Dede.

543
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,283
You know, Zack...

544
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,578
...my daddy wasn't really in the picture
much when I was growing up.

545
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,833
As a result, I never really learned
the art of carpentry.

546
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,713
I figure Jesus was a carpenter, and his
daddy wasn't around to teach him...

547
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,673
...so I taught myself.

548
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:03,262
Over time, I got to be
a pretty good swinger of the hammer.

549
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,849
Now, the good news is...

550
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:11,937
...unlike my papa
and the Great Almighty, I am here...

551
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,689
...for good.

552
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,692
Don't make no mistake about it.

553
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,280
We will be a family...

554
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,992
...if it kills us.

555
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,512
It's so sweet.

556
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,564
Car's out front. Let's move out.

557
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,816
These two are never gonna
make it in a car together.

558
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,361
- You keep your brother in check.
- You don't know him.

559
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,572
Then get my gun from him.
We don't have time for this.

560
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,033
You still think you're running
this show, don't you?

561
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,993
You still think I'm not?

562
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,839
Yes, I'd like the number for
Channel 11 News, please.

563
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,174
What are you doing?

564
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,093
This is not the plan. Hang up.

565
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,469
Yes, connect me. I'll hold.

566
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,430
Scofield,
you call the news, they call the cops.

567
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,933
Yes, put me through.

568
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,559
Hang up.

569
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,940
Hang up the phone now.

570
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,276
Hang it up.

571
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,823
<i>Channel Eleven News. Can I help you?</i>

572
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,075
This is Michael Scofield.

573
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,452
I'm at the Cutback Motel, room 11.

574
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,126
And I want to turn myself in.

575
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,465
Bradlee.

576
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,806
Bradlee.

577
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,146
Warden's gone home, bitch.

578
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,314
The mice are gonna play.

579
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,193
Bradlee.

580
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,822
Bradlee.

581
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,325
Bradlee.

582
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,248
If anything jumps off, you get my back.
I won't forget it.

583
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,792
Why don't you just
forget it right now?

584
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,005
Here in this cell,
you're top bunk. Out there...

585
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,841
...you're on your own.

586
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,762
Bradlee.

587
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:54,016
You want a piece of me, you sons
of bitches? Come and get me.

588
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,809
You hear me?

589
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,937
I ain't scared of you.

590
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,398
I ain't scared of nothing.

591
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,489
Bradlee.

592
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,205
Start praying.

593
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:27,800
Yes?

594
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,718
Mr. Kim.

595
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,888
I just wanted you to know...

596
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,724
...that I'm getting back to work.

597
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,311
<i>Good.</i>

598
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,397
So I take it you got my message.

599
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,234
Oh, yeah.

600
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,904
Loud and clear.

601
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,167
Please don't do this.
Please, come on, please.

602
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,587
I'm sorry, Terrence, it's too late.
The press is already on their way.

603
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,506
You can put the guns away now.

604
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,634
This goes wrong,
you guys are on your own.

605
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,096
No, if I go back home. Okay?
Let me, please. I'll go home.

606
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,473
You can't go home, Terrence.
None of us can, okay?

607
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,684
So just relax. Keep your head.

608
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,604
Okay, okay, okay.

609
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,523
- Terrence.
- Terrence, Terrence.

610
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,066
I'm leaving.

611
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,655
Terrence.
We can't let you do that, Terrence.

612
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,867
All we need is your mouth.
I will shoot out your knees right now.

613
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,328
I never liked you, Paul.
I won't hesitate to take your life.

614
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,500
All right, just...

615
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,127
Terrence, listen to me.

616
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,795
Just listen.

617
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:50,257
Terrence, for once in your life,
do the right thing.

618
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,176
All right?

619
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,846
So many people have suffered
because of this, because of you.

620
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,307
But when the press get here...

621
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,475
...you can tell the truth.

622
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,311
You can end this.

623
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,480
What is in it for me?

624
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,524
Disgrace? Life in prison?

625
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,359
You're already in prison, Terrence.

626
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:12,571
How many people have to die
so you can stay in some cabin...

627
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,698
...in the woods? It's over.

628
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,708
Okay.

629
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,502
Okay.

630
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,637
- Sorry.
- Terrence, no.

631
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,327
We have to go.

632
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,412
Go where? We've got Steadman.

633
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,331
No, we have nothing.

634
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,919
All we got is a John Doe.

635
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,299
Michael.

636
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,469
Michael, let's go.
