1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,710
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,213
Mr. Kim. Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,548
- Pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,510
- I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president.

5
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,720
I'll contact her.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>No family with Patoshik?</i>

7
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,644
<i>- Nothing?</i>
- Yeah.

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,896
Until about four years ago
when he killed them.

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,150
<i>MAHONE. Fernando Sucre.</i>
<i>He was in Las Vegas around 2.</i>

10
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,569
Out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.

11
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,865
You know D.B. Cooper? The money's
in Utah and they're all going to get it.

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>You're one of them Fox River boys.</i>

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,588
- Come on, you got the map?
- No. Someone else does.

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,509
Before I destroyed it, I committed it
to my photographic memory.

15
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:56,055
I have the information, you have
the manual requirements necessary...

16
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,182
...to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,727
- Get in.
- Okay.

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,647
Should be dead ahead.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,942
The bastards built over it.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,527
It's gone.

21
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,477
We have to open up in 15 minutes.

22
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,313
- So? That doesn't matter. I dare you.
- I said no.

23
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,149
I dare you, please.

24
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,560
The ranch is gone, Michael.

25
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,564
Well, the five million might not be.

26
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,732
And you're gonna find it how?

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,402
What, you got a divining rod
tattooed on your ass?

28
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,320
I don't wanna hear anything
from you...

29
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:20,241
...other than what your photographic
memory spits out regarding that map!

30
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,743
You watch your tone with me, boy.

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,206
I will watch you get tossed to the side
of the road to fend for yourself, boy.

32
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,750
Because if you can't remember
where that silo was...

33
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,919
...you're worthless to us.

34
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,338
- Yo, fools, let me out.
- Shut up.

35
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,050
- The map!
- Okay, okay. All right, all right, all right.

36
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,427
Let me out, boss.

37
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,929
The ranch was in the center of a box.

38
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,433
Sheep Road on one side,
Kokosing Road perpendicular.

39
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,437
In the center of the property
was the ranch house...

40
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,773
...and the ranch house
was surrounded by trees.

41
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,401
Let me out.

42
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,372
Every tree here is a year old at most...

43
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,875
...except those.

44
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,879
Where's the silo?

45
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,595
Inside the trees,
I wanna say on the left...

46
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,306
...but that may have been a barn.

47
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,976
I remembered the best I could, gents,
but I didn't know this place...

48
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,020
...would now be smothered
in tract homes.

49
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,398
So, you know, I'm sorry
that I'm not Rain Man over here.

50
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,238
- Alex Mahone. How are you?
- Lyle Sands.

51
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,449
We've been briefed
on all the men at large.

52
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,827
The full force and resources
of the entire Salt Lake City Field Office...

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,245
...are at your disposal.

54
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,499
Thank you. Do you have the files
my office requested on D.B. Cooper?

55
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,044
We're pulling them now. And this is
the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?

56
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,172
Correct. If I can get those files
immediately, I'd appreciate it.

57
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,592
Sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?

58
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,514
I am. And they're here in Utah
to get D.B. Cooper's money.

59
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,015
So how about those files, Lyle?

60
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,188
- Silo. Silo, silo.
- This is stupid.

61
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,901
- We're gonna get made out here.
- All right, shut it. I think I remember.

62
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,863
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo
being on the left of the ranch house...

63
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,365
...inside the trees.

64
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,868
No. It's outside the trees.

65
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,870
Right there.

66
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,041
You see those two trees?
They're shorter than the rest.

67
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,293
They were all planted
at the same time...

68
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,337
...but those two
didn't get as much sunlight.

69
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,131
Something was in their way.

70
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,842
The silo.

71
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,678
Our money should be right there,
under that garage.

72
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,555
You better be right, boy.

73
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,807
This isn't a high-end subdivision.

74
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,892
They slapped this place up overnight.

75
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,228
The silo's foundations
might still be there.

76
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,772
To save money, they probably
just laid the concrete...

77
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,066
...for the garage floor
right on top of it.

78
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,487
We'll dig straight down. If we hit
the foundation, we stay. If not, we go.

79
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,906
Let's do it.

80
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,662
Oh, man.

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,756
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver
to her temple won't fix.

82
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,591
People die all the time, boys.

83
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,095
Five million dollars
comes once in a lifetime.

84
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,263
Let me out of here.
Come on, guys.

85
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,807
Well, we gotta do something.

86
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,101
And it's not gonna involve
hurting anyone.

87
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,316
I got an idea.

88
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,485
First,
we're gonna need some supplies.

89
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,256
A hundred and 10 percent,
I do not agree with this.

90
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,675
Everybody's gotta
pitch in to make this happen.

91
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,637
But back in the big house,
the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.

92
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,264
Which is why we're doing it here.

93
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,642
If he gets caught in town,
he ain't got a clue where the house is.

94
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,021
Besides, you're the one
we can't turn our backs on.

95
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,655
I could have died in there, man.

96
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,201
Well, guess what.
I need you to do something.

97
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,955
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.

98
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,833
Well, we'll talk
once you prove we can trust you.

99
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,085
What do I gotta do?

100
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,964
I want you to go back to that garden
center and get everything on this list.

101
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,925
And gas up the car.

102
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,555
And we'll meet you right back here
in an hour.

103
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,059
- All right.
- And, David...

104
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,230
...don't screw this up.

105
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,609
This ain't Fox River no more, man.

106
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,112
You're looking at the real deal now.

107
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,656
But I want my cut.

108
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,912
Be back in an hour.

109
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,085
Let's go.

110
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,922
Mistake.

111
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,341
Big mistake.

112
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,539
Oh, come on, now.

113
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,151
Am I glad to see you.

114
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,238
You walk here?

115
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,158
No, it's just a long story, man.

116
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,828
I thought you were meeting up
with your family.

117
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,998
I met a few roadblocks. And you?

118
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,250
Yeah.

119
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,003
Well, let me guess.
You're going to Tooele.

120
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,963
Yeah.

121
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,009
Well, looks like we're going
the same direction.

122
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,678
Hopefully, we're not too late.

123
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,847
Can I hitch a ride?

124
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey, look...

125
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,356
...I'll make it worth your while.

126
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,943
We've got some good news, sir.

127
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,529
We got our first tip on Patoshik.

128
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,199
Spotted at a burger joint
in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.

129
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,201
Hand it over to local
authorities for now.

130
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,038
The only thing we're working today
is Utah and D.B. Cooper.

131
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,706
Got it.

132
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,917
Lyle.

133
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,629
There's a guy listed as having
the only D.B. Cooper bill ever found.

134
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,131
- Harold Jenkins.
- Yeah.

135
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,674
D.B. bought gas from Jenkins...

136
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,052
...with a hundred
on the day of the hijacking.

137
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,888
We checked the serial numbers
and they matched.

138
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,306
You worked the case?

139
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,518
Fresh out of the academy
and nobody's cracked it yet.

140
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,397
What makes you think that these
escapees know where the money is?

141
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,150
Because they may have been locked up
with the real D.B. Cooper.

142
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,319
Jenkins from the gas station,
he still alive?

143
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,321
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.

144
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,698
Well, let's go say hi to him.

145
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,111
We're sorry, that
<i>call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

146
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,114
<i>Please check the number</i>
<i>and dial again.</i>

147
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,880
Do you have
updates on Sara Tancredi?

148
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,590
I assume that's why you're here.

149
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,217
Yes.

150
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,178
Scofield sent her a message
through the mail.

151
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,515
A phone number
that was disconnected.

152
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,644
You know, to be honest...

153
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,730
...I was expecting
to brief the president.

154
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,484
Yeah, about that.

155
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,905
Right now, as you can imagine,
Carolyn's quite busy.

156
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,451
She's always been busy.
I've been working with her for 15 years.

157
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,869
Paul...

158
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,121
...she's the president
of the Unites States now.

159
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,623
Yes, Bill,
and I helped to put her there.

160
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,793
Well, if you'd like for her
to remain in office...

161
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,255
...you'll take my advice and just stay
on the sidelines for now.

162
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,052
She needs to be completely insulated
from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.

163
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,182
I wanna talk to her.

164
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,146
You report to me now, and only me.

165
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,982
Don't try and contact Carolyn again
without my approval...

166
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,194
...and don't show up here
unannounced.

167
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,158
Finish the job you were given.
Get Burrows.

168
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,038
If you're telling me the road to him leads
through Sara Tancredi, by all means...

169
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,789
...pursue it.

170
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,585
And once that's been accomplished
and this whole thing goes away...

171
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,214
...we'll go about transitioning you back
into Carolyn's life.

172
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,344
Now,
do you have anything else on Sara?

173
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,388
The president
has unwavering faith in you.

174
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,599
She wants you to go through
Senate approval...

175
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,017
...with your eyes wide open.

176
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,145
- So what are we up against?
- Key allies in the House and Senate...

177
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,189
...are Meyerhoff,
Barnwell and Sommerville.

178
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,275
- Counting on them to sway the middle.
- Who's the opposition?

179
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,819
Senators Blake and Killoren
have openly vocalized...

180
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,655
...their opposition to you as VP.

181
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,907
Any indication as to why?

182
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,619
Political payback for the president's vote
on the energy bill last month.

183
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,288
Took them by surprise
and they don't like surprises.

184
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,838
- Dad. Lance, this is my father, Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.

185
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,174
It's nothing to lose sleep over.

186
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,927
Frankly, the biggest issue
we have to address...

187
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,596
...are the charges
facing your daughter.

188
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,099
Governor, are you with me?

189
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,768
Absolutely.

190
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,702
Yo, just chill, dog. Listen...

191
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:16,790
...once we roll, we bounce out of town,
we'll drop a dime and they'll find you.

192
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,876
Just be quiet. Just chill, man.

193
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,686
Woody?

194
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,274
Where you at? Woody?

195
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,001
I need Sheriff Williams.

196
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,378
Yeah, I'll hold.

197
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,220
Woody?

198
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,238
Where'd you learn about electricity?

199
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,158
I used to steal copper wiring
from transformer boxes.

200
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,827
Then I'd sell them on the docks,
make a few bucks.

201
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,705
You were in school, of course.

202
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,260
I was just looking, pretty.
What's that old chestnut?

203
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,222
I can look at the menu,
doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.

204
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,016
We get in, we get the money,
we get out.

205
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,103
- That's it.
- No, absolutely.

206
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,406
We're good.

207
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,994
Now, it's just up to the kid.

208
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,045
- Did you get everything?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

209
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,652
- What?
- Nothing. It's cool. I handled it.

210
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,156
- What?
- Whoa. Okay.

211
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,325
Check it. This fool came in the shop.

212
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,786
He was acting all shady,
he got a bad vibe...

213
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,540
...so he picked up his cellie phone, he
started to make a call, so I popped him.

214
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,542
- What?!
- I hit him with the shovel, man.

215
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,419
I didn't know what else to do.

216
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,298
I tied him up and I put him in the back
room with that other country hick.

217
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,468
- Here we go. Here we go.
- I came through, you gimp.

218
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,346
- Who was he calling?
- The sheriff.

219
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,850
Man, I don't know, dude.
It just set off so quick.

220
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,478
- Did the call go through?
- Maybe, man. I don't know.

221
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,188
Maybe? Did the call go through?

222
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,816
Yes, I-- No, I don't know.
I don't know, man.

223
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,238
Yo, but I got the gear.

224
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,573
We gotta move on this now.

225
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,410
Yes?

226
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:44,206
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?

227
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,083
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.

228
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,127
Right here.

229
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,713
Alexander Mahone, FBI.

230
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,090
I'm staying 50 feet
away from her at all times.

231
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,176
What the hell else does she want?

232
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,094
I'm not here about that.

233
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,807
- What are you here for?
- D.B. Cooper.

234
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,934
People still wanna
know about that guy?

235
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,727
Unbelievable.

236
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,481
You worked the gas station
in American Fork where he filled up.

237
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,819
Yeah. Normal-looking guy.
Barely said a word.

238
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,656
There were some discrepancies
in the statement you filed 30 years ago.

239
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,368
In the report, it's noted that you said
he filled up at 7 a. m...

240
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,288
...but on another occasion,
you said it was 7 p.m.

241
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,500
- Which was it?
- Both.

242
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,585
He gassed up twice?

243
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,504
Yeah.

244
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,881
Full tanks both times?

245
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,426
Yeah. Why?

246
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,846
A systems what?

247
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,431
It's a systems diagnostics test.

248
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,725
Footage from our gopher cam
picked up exactly...

249
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,435
...where your line was corrupted.

250
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,604
And who corrupted it?

251
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,190
- You guys?
- Maybe.

252
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,443
All I know is my supervisor called
and said he wants me and my crew...

253
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,780
...to get over here and fix that problem
double quick, double time.

254
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,242
So...

255
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,745
- ...you're not with the electric company?
- No, ma'am.

256
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,081
Now, feel free to call your company.

257
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,625
But I tell you,
all they'll do is send over some tech.

258
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,252
Maybe tomorrow, if you're lucky.

259
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,255
And he'll spend a whole day
trying to find the problem...

260
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,174
...and another day trying to fix it.

261
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,927
But we're here right now.

262
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,305
And we're ready
to turn your juice back on.

263
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,224
My juice?

264
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,393
That's right.

265
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,479
And...

266
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,067
...that's your crew?

267
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,573
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,201
Yeah, D.B. Cooper
was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.

269
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,330
There's no record on file
that Cooper even had a car.

270
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,291
But Charles Westmoreland did
and the car registered to him...

271
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,003
...at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova
with a 16-gallon gas tank.

272
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,840
Back then, a Chevy that size got
approximately eight miles to the gallon.

273
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,551
D.B. stopped at the station
in American Fork...

274
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,303
...and gassed up once early that day...

275
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,056
...and then came back later that same
night and gassed up again.

276
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,391
<i>Why would a guy headed to Mexico...</i>

277
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,268
<i>...which is a straight shot south...</i>

278
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,646
<i>...drive off the main road</i>
<i>for an all-day detour?</i>

279
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,022
- The money.
- Exactly.

280
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,109
Cooper, Westmoreland,
jumped out of a plane with $5 million.

281
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,697
But Westmoreland didn't have the money
on him when he was arrested.

282
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,742
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that magic marker.

283
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,244
From American Fork,
he couldn't have gone further...

284
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,913
...than 64 miles in any direction.

285
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,248
I want everything you've got
in that perimeter.

286
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,376
Those cons
are in one of these towns...

287
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,171
...and if there's so much as a cat
missing in one of them, I wanna know.

288
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,636
The defective cable runs
right beneath your garage.

289
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,639
We're gonna have to dig up the floor
to get to it.

290
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,600
Well, who's gonna pay for this...

291
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,269
...and what about the cleanup
and the repair?

292
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,398
Well, the company will cover all costs.

293
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,983
We'll just dig a small trench.

294
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,861
Once we're finished, we'll re-lay
the cement. It'll look as good as new.

295
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,989
How long is it gonna take?

296
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,992
One way or another,
we'll be out of here today.

297
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,286
Really need to get started, ma'am.

298
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,040
Wouldn't want a pretty little thing
like yourself sitting...

299
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,793
...in the dark tonight, now, would we?

300
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,922
Well, that depends
on who I'm sitting with.

301
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,299
Touché.

302
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,849
Fine. It's okay, y'all go ahead
and do whatever y'all need to do.

303
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,810
Jeanette,
the noise might be substantial.

304
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,521
You might wanna take
in that tennis game after all.

305
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,315
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.

306
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,446
Plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all
and make sure you don't steal anything.

307
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,322
Ma'am.

308
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,329
- How are you?
- Good.

309
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,666
All right, where's Tweener?

310
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,918
He's next door
plugging in the extension cord.

311
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:04,090
- We're gonna have to cut up the cement.
- Yo, we gots company.

312
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,765
What's up, snowflake?

313
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,689
Well, as always,
your timing is flawless.

314
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,693
- I don't follow.
- Well, let me try to explain it to you.

315
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,528
We're trying to run something here...

316
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,531
...and we can't have people
walking in off the street.

317
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,828
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave
and then you can just mail us the check?

318
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,999
Sucre, I know you trust me...

319
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,460
...and you know I'll cut you in
on that money.

320
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,880
But the two of you being here right now
jeopardizes everything.

321
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,342
I'm not going nowhere.

322
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,135
I want my share of the money.

323
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,639
Wait a minute, hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?

324
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,475
You know,
I say I want in, you say no...

325
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,312
...then I threaten to tell somebody
about what's going on here.

326
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:04,025
And then you decide to play nice
and then we're one big happy family.

327
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,321
Why don't we just stop wasting time,
all right?

328
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,620
Thank you.

329
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,046
Damn, man, you still alive?

330
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,591
And kicking, homeboy.

331
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,176
How'd you find us?

332
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,555
Man, if I can do rapid deployment
of satellite communications...

333
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,640
...for Uncle Sam all over the world--

334
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,476
How are you guys doing?

335
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,272
Who are you? Who are they?

336
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,358
I had to call my supervisor.

337
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,319
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.

338
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,073
They want to get this done as quickly
and as efficiently as possible.

339
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,838
Well, Jeanette, like I said,
there's a lot of work to do...

340
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,381
...and it's gonna be noisy.

341
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,301
Oh, drinks. I forgot to ask.

342
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,386
We're good. Thanks.

343
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,231
Yo, man, this is not good.

344
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,818
We got her up in our grill
checking in on us all the time.

345
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,821
The boy is right.

346
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,910
And since I can't dig,
I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.

347
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,621
You don't touch her.

348
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,664
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?

349
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,209
I know how to play nice.

350
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,461
I'll be watching.

351
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,891
Billy? Is that you?

352
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,859
Billy, is that you?

353
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,199
Yeah.

354
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,749
Thank you kindly.

355
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:13,339
Well, now,
how did you get out of working?

356
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,717
Union rules.

357
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,011
One crew member
always has to supervise.

358
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:22,682
- Oh.
- I'll check on them in a bit.

359
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,936
Lemonade?

360
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,690
Hm.

361
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,695
Little more ice?

362
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,576
Yeah.

363
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,874
And I like mine with a little oomph.

364
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,168
But since you're on the clock...

365
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:55,965
...I guess you can't join me?

366
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,427
Just two fingers.

367
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,183
All right.

368
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,869
It's been a while.

369
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,871
Yeah?

370
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:36,881
Whiskey
always makes me feel irascible.

371
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,385
I don't know what that means.

372
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,722
But I do like the sound of it.

373
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,230
Are you wearing Angel perfume?

374
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,401
I am.

375
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,156
Ah. Hm.

376
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,911
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.

377
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,955
Yeah.

378
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,418
Now, is that good memories...

379
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:17,338
...or bad memories?

380
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,425
Both.

381
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,061
Did you talk to Maricruz?

382
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,063
I don't wanna talk about her.

383
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,275
I gotta get some water or something.

384
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,027
Use the hose on the other side
of the house.

385
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,949
Sucre...

386
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:49,954
...down the road, if you're in trouble,
Europeangoldfinch.net.

387
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,209
It's what we can all use
to communicate.

388
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,295
Post a note on the message board.

389
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,551
- What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch.net.

390
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,137
That's a bird, right?

391
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,478
I got something.

392
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,321
- It's the silo's foundation.
- Hells, yeah.

393
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,157
Thank you, Charles.

394
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,077
We just need to find the edge
and dig underneath it.

395
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,374
We'll get the money,
hit the back roads.

396
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,752
Uh, well...

397
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,587
What's wrong?

398
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,509
We got to stop in Tooele first
and gas up our ride.

399
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,969
I thought you already did that.

400
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,973
Man, when the garden center thing
happened, I just forgot, all right?

401
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,352
I want you to go back into town.

402
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,354
I want you to gas up that car...

403
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:59,732
...because I'm not driving around
with millions of dollars in the trunk.

404
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,527
- Do you understand?
- Man, why do I got to do it?

405
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,031
Okay.

406
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,043
I better check in on our friend.

407
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,382
You got it all the time.

408
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,009
Miss Tinsel toes.

409
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:41,524
Billy?

410
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,359
Yeah?

411
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,653
I made you a sandwich.

412
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,156
Peanut butter and jelly
with the crusts cut off.

413
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,243
Just like you like.

414
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,416
I'm so glad you came back.

415
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:05,548
I don't wanna say I told you so,
but that was just not the girl for you.

416
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,430
Where is that?

417
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,600
Where's what, sweetheart?

418
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,269
That painting.

419
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:23,274
It's Holland, where
I grew up. You know that.

420
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,529
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, there's no place better.

421
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,990
It's so peaceful...

422
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:35,328
...so protected from this crazy world.

423
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,259
<i>Operator.</i>

424
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,761
Hello, operator.

425
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,013
There's an intruder in my house.

426
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,647
<i>Hello, ma'am? Ma'am, are you there?</i>

427
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,191
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

428
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,863
Heard you had
some activity in Tooele today.

429
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,824
A bit. Don't see how it warrants
a visit from the FBI.

430
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,826
A stolen car
was dumped outside of town...

431
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,037
...belonging to a woman
from St. Louis.

432
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,790
- Am I getting that right?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,668
And then here, the owner's
girlfriend reports him missing...

434
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:28,297
...and then his buddy comes by
to check it out and he goes missing too.

435
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,841
Woody and Chet have been known
to drop everything...

436
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,427
...and go boar hunting
when the opportunity arises.

437
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,846
And they don't tell their old ladies.

438
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,310
I'll bet you my lunch money...

439
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,521
...there's nothing
amiss around here.

440
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,860
His dad will be showing up soon with
the keys and you can look for yourself.

441
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,196
Whoa, what are you doing?

442
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,579
Mr. Mahone.

443
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,097
They're here. Those escaped
convicts. They're here in town.

444
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,880
Who's there?

445
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,842
It's the police, ma'am. You okay?

446
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,261
Yes.

447
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,016
- Can you tell me what happened?
- There was this strange man.

448
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,437
I made him a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

449
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,148
I thought he was Billy.

450
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:16,781
And once the kids went to sleep,
we'd take a bath.

451
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,785
A long bath.

452
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:26,624
And afterwards, I'd just sit there
and watch her do her routine.

453
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,711
She'd rub her lotion on,
comb her hair...

454
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,548
...dress up in her nighttime fineries.

455
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,259
Oh, you're killing me.

456
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:43,390
She had this spot on her neck
right here.

457
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,896
Gave her goose bumps every time.

458
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,029
And that perfume...

459
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:06,914
My ex, he was an accountant.

460
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,834
He was really buttoned up.

461
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,213
It was wham, bam, thank you, Sam.

462
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,175
Well, shame on him.

463
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:26,058
Why did it end with that lady
you were talking about?

464
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,024
Just went our separate ways.

465
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:45,619
Do you know what I think
the best cure is for a broken heart?

466
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,665
Do tell.

467
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,127
Get back on the bike.

468
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,130
Whatever bike it is.

469
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,970
Amen to that.

470
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,805
Speaking of...

471
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,977
...could you do something for me?

472
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,565
I'm certain of it.

473
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,652
Come here.

474
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,073
Only, you have to be very discreet.

475
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,912
They don't come any discreeter.

476
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,415
You know that big guy?

477
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:36,754
The strong guy
that doesn't speak much?

478
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,422
Would you go in there...

479
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,425
...and ask him if he would like
to have a drink with me...

480
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,761
...after he punches out?

481
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,430
Please.

482
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,809
You've just been playing me
this whole time, haven't you?

483
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,937
Come on.

484
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,605
Don't be like that.

485
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,025
Would you just go in
and ask your friend?

486
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,110
Please.

487
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,550
- Hey, Dad.
- Sara, I've been trying to reach you.

488
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,304
Uh, yeah, I've been meeting
with my defense attorneys all day.

489
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,473
- You in Washington?
- Yeah, I'm coming back...

490
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,350
...on the next flight.

491
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,478
- I thought you're gonna be there awhile.
- No, plan's changed.

492
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,315
<i>Sara, you remember that guy that I met</i>
<i>with you in your apartment?</i>

493
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,192
I want you to stay away from him.

494
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,653
Who, Lance from my group?

495
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,489
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.

496
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,866
<i>I found out some other things too.</i>

497
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,828
- What are you talking about?
<i>- You were right.</i>

498
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,498
<i>- Sara?</i>
- I gotta go.

499
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,218
Yeah, that's right.

500
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,679
Yeah.

501
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,476
- Yo.
- Just one second, sir.

502
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,062
Thank you.

503
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,399
- Can I help you?
- Just put 40 on three.

504
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm sorry, what pump was that?

505
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,487
- Three.
- That one's been sticking.

506
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,866
- Okay. Then, I'll move the car.
- No. No, don't trouble yourself.

507
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,535
I'll have the mechanic come out
and pump it for you.

508
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,662
I've got a customer waiting on three.

509
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,707
- All right, I'll be right there.
- I'm in a hurry, all right?

510
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,959
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.

511
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,945
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

512
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,323
- Oh, God.
- Drop!

513
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,952
Where are they?

514
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,540
What? What?

515
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:05,254
Where are they?

516
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,926
Hey, man, one hand or not, I think
hillbilly needs to be up in here digging.

517
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,011
What you think?

518
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,980
Good man.

519
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,043
What the hell are you doing up here?

520
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,546
I'm sorry, Jeanette.

521
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,340
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.

522
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,426
- I apologize for barging in.
- Don't bother.

523
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,554
She's got the hots
for the big strong one.

524
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,056
I'm sorry, Jeanette.
We're gonna get back to work now.

525
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,558
I think y'all are done.

526
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,561
And I think y'all need to leave now.

527
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,730
We're almost finished.

528
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:08,400
No, I think you are finished, okay?
And I want you to leave my house now.

529
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,701
Sucre, check it out.

530
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,964
Cop.

531
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,094
Oh, thank God.

532
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,602
- Where you going?
- Oh!

533
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,855
- T-Bag, let her go!
- Oh, God.

534
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,191
She's our only way out of this, pretty.

535
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:56,031
Don't say a word, you old whore,
or I'm gonna cut your throat out.
