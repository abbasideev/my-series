1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,585
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,213
Yes. I'd like the number
for Channel 11 News, please.

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,382
Hang up the phone now.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,217
This is Michael Scofield.

5
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,678
I'm at the Cutback Motel, room 11.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,724
And I want to turn myself in.

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,728
Where is that?

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,732
It's Holland,
where I grew up. You know that.

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,984
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:31,364
This message is for Maricruz.
I'll be there in the airport.

11
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,366
In Ixtapa, waiting for you.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,661
Hi. My name is Sara, and I'm an addict.

13
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,621
Hi, Sara.

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,624
I'm just looking to do my time.
I don't want any trouble.

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,752
Hey! Break it up, convicts.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,631
This isn't fun, what was fun was
when Caroline and I talked about you...

17
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,092
...and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

18
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,761
He proposed to her.

19
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,180
- Hey!
- Terrence!

20
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,724
I'm leaving!

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,559
Terrence, listen to me.

22
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,354
Just listen. So many people have suffered
because of this, because of you.

23
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,941
But when the press get here,
you can tell the truth.

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,443
You can end this.

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,737
- Sorry.
- Terrence, no!

26
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,200
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,495
It's breaking news
out of Cutback, Montana.

28
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,497
Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

29
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,418
...two of the prisoners who broke out of
Fox River State Penitentiary in Illinois...

30
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,547
...have continued to elude the authorities,
leaving a trail of crime in their wake.

31
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,092
And today,
they left behind something else.

32
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,597
My name's Lincoln Burrows,
and I'm innocent.

33
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,523
- We're done.
- No other way out.

34
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,735
Next time you hold a press conference,
do it from a room with a back door.

35
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,528
Just let me think.

36
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,072
This is the Montana Highway Patrol.

37
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:58,326
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows...

38
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,828
...you need to exit
with your hands in the air.

39
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,998
- This is a warning.
- You got line of sight from there?

40
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,334
Exit with your hands up.

41
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,420
- What about him?
- Him? He's useless.

42
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,422
Dead body?
We got fingerprints everywhere.

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,341
You worried someone
will pin a murder on you?

44
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,802
What's your plan?
Leave the body, walk out the door?

45
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,346
Yes. That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

46
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:23,142
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows,
you need to exit with your hands up.

47
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,939
- FBI, hold your fire.
- FBI?

48
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,107
- I have Burrows and Scofield.
- Start rolling.

49
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,110
We're coming out. Hold your fire.

50
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,296
- Hold up, who are you?
- Federal Bureau of Investigation.

51
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,675
- We're going to Billings.
- Wait, let me see that ID again.

52
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,301
- Okay, okay.
- Drop the gun!

53
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,054
Everybody calm down
and this won't get ugly.

54
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,725
All right. I want keys
to both of the cop cars, now!

55
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,310
- Don't do it!
- Don't listen to him!

56
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,813
- Get the keys. Linc, get in the car.
- What's going on?

57
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,940
Getting out of here
before anyone gets hurt.

58
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,692
Lincoln, start it.

59
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,069
- Come on, come on!
- This is your last chance.

60
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,406
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- One more step, and I drop him.

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,991
Come on!

62
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,244
Open my door.

63
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,470
Welcome back.

64
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,931
- You feeling...?
- Much better.

65
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,227
- Update?
- Okay, you got it.

66
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,271
Yeah.

67
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,940
You got a lead on something?

68
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,610
One of the CO's from Fox River,
Brad Bellick.

69
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,779
Got locked up last night
for the murder of another guard.

70
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,573
Wait. We're looking for CO's now?

71
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,116
What about the escapees?

72
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,202
- Scofield, Burrows?
- Nothing on them currently.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,371
Also, Franklin's wife...

74
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,415
...was taken into custody
in North Dakota.

75
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,292
His wife?

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,711
Line two.

77
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,714
This is Agent Mahone.

78
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,930
How long ago?

79
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,903
I'll make you a deal. You don't move
a muscle, I won't blow your head off.

80
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,989
- No one's gonna hurt you, Greg.
- Where are we going, Michael?

81
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,824
We can't keep driving. Lost Steadman.

82
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,993
- Sara's in the wind--
- Shh, shh. Turn it up.

83
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,246
--murder of Terrence
Steadman, President Reynolds' brother.

84
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,500
The president could not be reached
as she continues to tour the Midwest...

85
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,335
...shoring up support in key states.

86
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:58,464
For entrepreneurs and orange
growers, iron workers and artists...

87
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,176
...the American dream is alive
and well for all of us.

88
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,512
Reynolds travels to Colorado today...

89
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,515
...for a scheduled appearance
in Denver that--

90
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,850
- Pull over.
- What for?

91
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,771
Just pull over.

92
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,212
Get out. Over here.

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,133
- You want to drop off this kid?
- Later.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,719
We should get rid of Kellerman too.
We don't need him.

95
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,848
Actually, we do. We still have assets.

96
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,894
It's just a question
of how we use them.

97
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,855
Bradlee.

98
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,111
Nurse.

99
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,905
You ain't no nurse.

100
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,364
You're right about that.

101
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,117
That's a pretty shiner you got,
captain.

102
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,786
Must make you think
about the times...

103
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,371
...you walked around here
in your fancy guard outfit.

104
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,958
Turning a blind eye
to everything you saw that was wrong.

105
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,795
"Who, me? Oh, I didn't see nothing."

106
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,214
How's that blind eye feel now?

107
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,050
- You son of a bitch.
- You get used to it.

108
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:10,054
Hear old one-eyed Jack's
gonna be getting screwed in the socket.

109
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,389
- Over my dead body.
- No.

110
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,059
A dead man can't feel a beat down.

111
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,144
And you got a lot more
coming your way.

112
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,315
Come on, now. Let's go.

113
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,350
It'll take the feds a while
to figure that out.

114
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,060
What time is it?

115
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,479
- A little after 9.
- It's gonna be tight.

116
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,356
Four hundred and fifty miles
in six hours.

117
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,275
- What do you think?
- Gotta move now.

118
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,193
Eyes front.

119
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,364
Hey, look at this.

120
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,373
- It's perfect, you ready?
- Yep.

121
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,045
Puerto Rico.

122
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,457
Here, Larry, this is for you.

123
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,126
What about this?

124
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,086
What is this? This is too small.

125
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,590
Why didn't it float? Why didn't it...?

126
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,092
I need more wood.

127
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,052
Wood floats.

128
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,054
This'll work.

129
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,517
Hey, man.

130
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,485
We were just wondering
if you could buy us some beer.

131
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,199
Yeah, sure.

132
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,787
Can I get some food for my dog too?

133
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,706
Do whatever thing you gotta do, man.

134
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,374
You can keep a beer for yourself.

135
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,086
Huh? Oh, no.

136
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,714
My dad used to drink.

137
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,653
You're gonna wanna see this.

138
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,658
We've shut down every freeway
in central Montana.

139
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,911
- So far, no sign of them.
- Go wider.

140
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,913
Put troopers on 90 and 94,
all the way through Wyoming.

141
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,125
Call Whitefish. Have them lock down
the Canadian border at 15.

142
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,753
--have continued
to elude the authorities...

143
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,671
...leaving a trail of crime in their wake.

144
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,383
And today,
they left behind something else.

145
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,594
My name's Lincoln Burrows,
and I'm innocent.

146
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,139
I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary...

147
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,768
...because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.

148
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,521
I did not murder Terrence Steadman.

149
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,732
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel...

150
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,944
...30 miles outside from his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

151
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,279
He killed himself out of fear...

152
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,784
...fear of the people who've been
hiding him for the past three years.

153
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,578
The same people
who want my brother dead.

154
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,125
They don't want you to know
who they are, but know this:

155
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:35,462
They've stolen billions of dollars
and murdered dozens of innocent people.

156
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,633
And yet, they plaster our faces
on the news, and tell you to be afraid.

157
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,178
They are a group
of multinationals, corporate interests.

158
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,472
Together, they're known
as The Company.

159
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,183
They are working
with the highest levels of government...

160
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,727
...including
the president of the United States.

161
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,148
- Damage control.
- They've stolen billions of dollars.

162
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,983
Before this hits page one.

163
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,777
- It's already airing, sir.
- Start a wildfire in Florida!

164
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,197
Find a storage unit full of Arabs!
I do not care!

165
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,159
As long as it's
not about Lincoln Burrows!

166
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,952
- And they operate with impunity.
- Go!

167
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,166
Under the cover of the Secret Service,
the people meant to protect and serve.

168
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,359
Much blame has been placed...

169
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:06,446
...on another innocent person,
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

170
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,949
Do we know how long
the videotape lasts?

171
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,411
Twenty-six minutes, beginning to end.
It's all online.

172
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,330
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

173
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,876
I can only hope that by now
you've found your safe haven.

174
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,089
Start a transcript. I need every word.

175
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,511
And I put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

176
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,346
I wish I could do things differently.

177
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,932
Call Montana. Send an agent
to talk to the cameraman.

178
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,518
I wanna know what he saw, heard,
what they're wearing.

179
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,146
- Anything he can give us.
- Yeah.

180
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:45,569
Special Agent Alexander Mahone,
is responsible for multiple deaths.

181
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,739
He murdered not only
John Abruzzi and David Apolskis...

182
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,908
...but also the last fugitive
he was assigned to chase...

183
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,702
...a man names Oscar Shales.

184
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,163
A man who escaped from prison
two years ago...

185
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,915
...who remains one of this country's
most wanted...

186
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,295
- ...despite the fact he'll never be found.
- Guy's nuts.

187
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,506
They'll do whatever it takes
to make the deaths look official.

188
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,384
Like they happened in the line of duty.
Disappearances...

189
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,556
- Hey, thank you.
- Sure. Here you go.

190
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,981
What's the wood for?

191
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,859
I'm building a raft.

192
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,071
I need more wood
if I'm gonna make it to Holland.

193
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,074
- Holland?
- Yeah.

194
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,370
You want to see it? The raft?

195
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:42,125
You're gonna try to get
from here to Holland in that?

196
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:46,046
Uh-huh.
- Yeah, good luck, Gilligan.

197
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,839
I'm gonna take a leak.

198
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,052
Um, how are you gonna know
where you're going?

199
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,846
Do you have like a map or anything?

200
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,101
Yeah, I do.

201
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,270
It's right...

202
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,730
Oh, it's right here.

203
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,448
- That's your map?
- Uh-huh.

204
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,412
Well, I really hope you make it.

205
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,708
You know, every morning I wake up
and wonder...

206
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,043
...what it would be like
to just disappear.

207
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,339
And you're just gonna do it.

208
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,925
I think it's great.

209
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,349
Okay.

210
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,441
What happened to your arm?

211
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,911
My dad drinks too.

212
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,625
What's going on?

213
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,836
- Oh, nothing.
- No, no. No, no, don't...

214
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,421
- I...
- Let me go.

215
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,591
- I just want to fix it. I just want to make--
- Let me go. Stop.

216
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,179
Matt, will you take me home, please?

217
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,972
No, I...

218
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,517
Freak.

219
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,464
All right, now, Brad. How we doing?

220
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,090
I could be better.

221
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:58,970
Yeah, that's a nasty contusion,
but it should go down in about 24 hours.

222
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,099
I got your paperwork here
for your transfer back to gen pop.

223
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,726
Already?

224
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,103
Move them in, move them out.
You know the policy.

225
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,524
- Katie.
- Um-hm?

226
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,818
You look nice today.

227
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,324
You've worked here
over 10 years, right?

228
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,493
Something like that.

229
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,372
That's a long time we've been friends.

230
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:31,336
If you think I can pull some strings to
keep you out of gen pop, I can't do that.

231
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,922
Please, please,
you can't send me back there.

232
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,925
Do you want that responsibility,
knowing what they'll do to me?

233
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,386
Just listen, please. One more night.

234
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,429
Just let me stay here tonight.

235
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,807
I know you can do that.

236
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:50,146
And when you go home,
just leave that door open for me.

237
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,739
They hung a sheet behind their heads
on the wall.

238
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,784
Uh, one of them,
the guy with the gun...

239
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:08,164
...he found it while Burrows and Scofield
talked about how far they had to go.

240
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,208
Uh...

241
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,588
Scofield said something
about 450 miles in six hours.

242
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:20,176
- Four hundred fifty miles to where?
- I don't know.

243
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,306
Four hundred fifty miles in six hours.

244
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,894
Any point on this circle
could be their final destination.

245
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,813
Seventy-five miles per hour,
stopping for gas.

246
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,900
- It's doable.
- Yeah.

247
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,818
Where are they?

248
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,115
I'm not sure. I still need more time.

249
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:46,286
This can't happen fast enough.
They've already done irreparable damage.

250
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,580
Scofield made the video
in a storage facility...

251
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,626
...somewhere between Great Falls
and Helena not long after sunrise.

252
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,461
From there, the witness said...

253
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,422
...that they had 450 miles
to get to where they were going.

254
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,134
There's Seattle, Portland,
Salt Lake, Denver...

255
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,137
- Denver?
- Yes, what?

256
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,556
The president is speaking there
this afternoon.

257
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,728
- Three o'clock.
- Six hours after they made the video.

258
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,314
They're going after the president.

259
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,616
A tape made by escaped convicts...

260
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,534
...Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

261
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,705
...was immediately dismissed by the
Justice Department as entirely baseless...

262
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,709
...which brings us back to the story we'll
continue to follow throughout the day.

263
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,711
Terror threat
has been raised to orange...

264
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,799
...as a storage unit rented by several
Arab-Americans was suddenly seized.

265
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,635
They buried it. Dumped it off
the front page and buried it.

266
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,053
It's what they do.

267
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,472
They can spin it all they want.
It's out there now.

268
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,725
Give it time, the tape is gonna work.

269
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,979
- It's a Hail Mary if we don't get to her.
- Getting to her is easy.

270
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,357
- What we do after's the problem.
- Which is why it has to happen quickly.

271
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,068
Once anyone knows we have her,
the curtain comes down.

272
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,116
- I'll notify the White House to cancel--
- No.

273
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,286
If there's a change, the brothers
will know and go back into hiding.

274
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,747
We've found them before.
We can find them again.

275
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,666
These are not pets, Agent Wheeler.

276
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,920
Yeah, thanks. I'm pretty clear on that.

277
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,090
But if you use the commander in chief
as bait, that's not gonna--

278
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,759
You have a problem
with the way that I do things?

279
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,722
Yeah.

280
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,766
And I'm not the only one.

281
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,603
Is that right?

282
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,608
Internal Affairs asked me to run all your
moves through them from here on out.

283
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,123
Then get a pen...

284
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,792
...and make sure
you get this word for word.

285
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,838
The president's day does not change.

286
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,924
The only lead we have is that we know
where these men are headed.

287
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,385
So we're gonna
keep quiet about this...

288
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,804
...and let them come.

289
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,891
Now get out of my office.

290
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,816
They're two of the most
recognizable faces in America.

291
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,986
How do they think they're gonna get
anywhere near the president?

292
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,280
Because it's not
just the two of them anymore.

293
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,616
I'm gonna go take a closer look
at that video.

294
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,412
If I may, sir, the president...

295
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,416
...are you certain
we should keep her in the dark on this?

296
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,461
Because there is...

297
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:45,423
...a scenario where she could be useful.

298
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,305
It is her ass on the line, sir.

299
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,682
I think we're pretty clear...

300
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,520
...she's been known to get her hands
dirty when that line gets too close.

301
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,690
Maybe we should let her know...

302
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,568
...just how close it is.

303
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,275
No.

304
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,538
They did a good job masking the room.
No reflections or flares.

305
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,667
Audio markers: church bells,
construction, traffic. Anything?

306
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:30,004
The room tone tells us they were
in a large space, 100,000 cubic feet.

307
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,548
So the kid with the camera,
his story matches up.

308
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,009
We clocked the quality of light
with the time of day.

309
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,678
It fits his wheres and whens.

310
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,096
All right, content.

311
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,557
The usual tells: eyes, hands, feet.

312
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,143
Burrows, we're able to baseline
off his trial footage...

313
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,312
...so we got even more clarity there.

314
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,564
I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary...

315
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:52,360
...because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.

316
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,363
- I did not murder Terrence Steadman.
- Okay, there.

317
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,700
The eyes. See it?

318
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,576
A slight shift to the left, then up.

319
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,371
Yeah, the blink rate's
up here verses the pattern.

320
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,582
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel...

321
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,669
...30 miles outside from his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.

322
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,132
- He's lying.
- Seems so.

323
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,847
Okay, here. Burrows, arms folded.

324
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,473
He's protecting himself.

325
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,393
Not a lot of confidence in these words.

326
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,187
Like they happened in the line of duty.

327
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,732
They mean something
other than what he's saying.

328
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,486
The posture. Shoulders in for emphasis.

329
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,613
He wants your attention here.

330
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,159
Okay, there.

331
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,786
- Adam's apple.
- Zoom in, zoom in.

332
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,621
See? He's swallowing.

333
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,540
Throat's dry. That's a lie.

334
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,376
- Yeah.
- His behavior is textbook.

335
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,379
If there's anything about
what they plan on doing in Denver...

336
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,131
...they're gonna tell us.

337
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:02,138
- Say it that way, it plays too earnest.
- Of course it will, it's the truth.

338
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,724
But the truth sends them home
to their wife and kids.

339
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,225
Lies will keep them busy.

340
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,478
I'm not telling a lie
to the whole country.

341
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,065
- It's our one chance to say it how--
- Say whatever the hell you want.

342
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,691
Tell them you're the Green Lantern.

343
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,735
I know how
they break down these tapes.

344
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:19,489
I've done it. Every detail matters.

345
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,910
Bin Laden crosses his legs right over left,
something different than left over right.

346
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,328
It's not the same message.

347
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,246
To them, it is.

348
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,750
If you want this plan to work,
whatever you say with your mouths...

349
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,836
...you need to say something different
with your bodies and eyes.

350
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,339
Slightly up and to the left.

351
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,385
Yes.

352
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,596
Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person...

353
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,599
President's motorcade is rolling in.
No sign of the brothers.

354
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,352
Right there.
What's Scofield doing with his hand?

355
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,107
We've been throwing them fastballs.
What do you say we mix it up a little?

356
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,525
Like what?

357
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,027
I think it's Morse code.

358
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,322
- For what?
- Well, right now, we got a phrase:

359
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,199
"The water is warm."

360
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,159
Any idea what that might mean?

361
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,162
- What the hell does that mean?
- Nothing.

362
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,540
It'll take the feds a while
to figure out.

363
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,585
We have teams checking the
surrounding counties for water temps.

364
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,130
Yeah, it might be a message
to an accomplice.

365
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,634
The North Platte River
runs through the city. Maybe--

366
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,804
It doesn't mean anything.
He's with an ex-Secret Service guy.

367
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,723
They're spoon-feeding us
every lead they want us to follow.

368
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,560
So this is a distraction
while they go after the president.

369
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,854
They had to know
the tape would be discredited.

370
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,148
They had to know
that we'd talk to the cameraman.

371
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,151
- There's something else going on.
- Much blame has been placed...

372
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,238
...on another innocent person,
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

373
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,075
Sara, if you're listening...

374
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,411
...I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

375
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,081
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

376
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:56,043
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others...

377
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,672
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

378
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,049
Sara, if you're listening...

379
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,427
...I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

380
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,805
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

381
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,517
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others...

382
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,770
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

383
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,356
...of your commitment to help others...

384
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,110
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

385
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,947
I've considered many ways to apologize,
but I must arrive at one.

386
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,325
It's more of the same here. Uh...

387
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,787
Body language, his tells. If you ask me,
it doesn't look like he means this at all.

388
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,624
- Don't care what it looks like. Play it.
- I don't see how--

389
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,042
Play it again.

390
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,963
I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

391
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,801
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others...

392
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,221
...and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare...

393
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,389
His voice.
Would you say he sounds sincere...

394
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,392
...when talking to her as opposed
to talking about their crimes?

395
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,894
I guess you could say that.

396
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,646
I did say that. Would you say that?

397
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,815
I wish I could do this differently,
but it's too late for that now.

398
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:03,110
- Yeah.
- It's too late for you and for others.

399
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,487
People murdered...

400
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:08,074
This isn't about Terrence Steadman
and it's not about their innocence.

401
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,159
- What?
- They're not after the president.

402
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,663
They're going after the doctor. I want
everything we got on Sara Tancredi.

403
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,331
Friends, families, pen pals.

404
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,876
If anybody wrote her a thank-you note,
I wanna know where the hell they are.

405
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,336
Now!

406
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,460
Sara Tancredi. Dad dead, mom dead.

407
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,714
E-mail account shows a minimal list
of contacts, with very little activity.

408
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,468
Credit cards used mostly for groceries,
sporadic clothing shopping...

409
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,388
...and the purchase
of single movie tickets.

410
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,889
And ob-gyn records tell us...

411
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,142
...she's had very little in the way
of sexual relationships recently.

412
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,646
Tell you the truth, I would say
the bulk of her life was her work.

413
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,332
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

414
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,936
Apparently, we took out a janitor.

415
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,689
When it all comes down,
all of this will get cleared up.

416
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,024
Well, it ain't coming down
if we don't get Sara.

417
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,651
She'll be here.

418
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,487
I wanna speak to my brother.

419
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,828
We gotta start thinking
about what to do if she doesn't show.

420
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,663
Or if she does.

421
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,417
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us...

422
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,794
...is to get whatever information
Sara has?

423
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,051
What if this is just one giant setup?

424
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,228
Well, good night.

425
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,079
About time you come home.

426
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,542
You out with that Feytek boy again?

427
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,504
- Sasha.
- No!

428
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,923
You may look like me...

429
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,761
...but you take after your mom when
it comes to the boys, now, don't you?

430
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,763
Hopefully with a little better taste.

431
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,019
Damn it, girl,
you are gonna show me some respect.

432
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,954
- I know Sara didn't have many friends.
- She's sort of a loner.

433
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,372
But you were her friend.

434
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,624
I like to think so, yes.

435
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,377
But you have no idea
where she is now?

436
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,337
No.

437
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,590
This is a transcript
of the Scofield-Burrows videotape.

438
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,635
I highlighted the part
where he talks directly to Sara.

439
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,888
Mean anything to you?

440
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,974
No.

441
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,727
You have no idea where
she might meet him, if that's his plan?

442
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,939
No.

443
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,651
Is Brad Bellick
still here in the infirmary?

444
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,403
Yeah. Why?

445
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,155
You must be loving this.

446
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,826
I didn't drive all this way to gloat.

447
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,995
Well, then, what the hell
you come here for?

448
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,168
First, I really gotta tip my cap to you.

449
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,297
You've managed to draw a bead on
the convicts more than my own staff.

450
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,840
Well, thanks for the "attaboy."

451
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,969
But as you can see, the correctional
system doesn't share your gratitude.

452
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,514
I won't take much of your time.
I have a few questions.

453
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,182
- About?
- Sara Tancredi.

454
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,311
She listed you as a reference
on herjob application to work here.

455
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,229
You know her well?

456
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,526
I'd know her a lot better if you can
get my ass moved to ad seg.

457
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,364
I have no influence with the DOC.
You know that.

458
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,868
You want my help, you do.

459
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,413
I'll talk to the warden,
see what I can do.

460
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,498
Right after you give me some answers.

461
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,877
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

462
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,672
You recognize anything here?

463
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,216
Anything that he may be
trying to tell her?

464
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,053
No. I mean, he's saying he's sorry.

465
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,848
Not that that's gonna do any good
with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

466
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,643
But...

467
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,895
What?

468
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,649
Ad seg.

469
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,697
Yeah.

470
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,076
You see here?

471
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,663
Where it says this stuff about
"another chance" and "safe haven"?

472
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,582
- That's out of the Big Book.
- What big book?

473
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,460
Alcoholics Anonymous.
Sara's in recovery.

474
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,087
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

475
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,255
Those are the names
of some of the chapters...

476
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,299
...in the book they use in AA.

477
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,760
Do you have a copy
of the Alcoholics Anonymous book?

478
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,515
Sara, if you're listening...

479
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,518
...I know I can't ask you
for another chance.

480
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,151
I can only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.

481
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:48,283
I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others.

482
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,330
I put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.

483
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,087
I've considered many ways to apologize,
but I must arrive at one.

484
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,760
- It's getting late.
- I know.

485
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,137
She's not here.

486
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,389
I know that too.

487
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,809
There is a chance
she didn't get the message.

488
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,644
Or maybe she's just sick of all this.

489
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,813
I mean, the girl bailed on you
back in Gila.

490
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,900
What makes you think
she's gonna come running back now?

491
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,988
The same thing that's been keeping us
going for the last three months.

492
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,240
- Faith.
- Yeah, well...

493
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,576
Reality's kicking faith's ass, man.

494
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,785
Michael Crane...

495
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,412
- Look--
- Wait, wait.

496
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,041
- Wait? Man, we can't wait anymore.
- Listen, listen.

497
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,334
Once again, Michael Crane...

498
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,336
...please report to the front desk.

499
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,006
You have a telephone call.

500
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,176
Yeah, Sara Tancredi.

501
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,094
Right, she might be with him.
Just--

502
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,182
Yes. Just call the local police in Akron
and tell them to get everyone they have...

503
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,350
...over to St. Thomas Hospital now.

504
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:02,941
Um, Michael Crane.
I think you've got a phone call for me.

505
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,444
Here you go.

506
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,614
- Thank you.
- Um-hm.

507
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,660
This is Mr. Crane.

508
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,038
It sounded better than origami.

509
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,374
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

510
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,878
I couldn't get to you in time.
This is the only thing I could think of.

511
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,048
I swore I'd leave you alone...

512
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,509
...but I had to contact you.

513
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,220
Because I have something?

514
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,430
How'd you know?

515
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,392
Michael, back in Gila,
I was coming back to you.

516
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,437
Somebody grabbed me...

517
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,024
...and they, um, told me that my father
had given me something.

518
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,069
Did someone hurt you?

519
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,862
I got away.

520
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,864
Uh...

521
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,577
Michael, I want for this to be over.

522
00:40:58,248 --> 00:40:59,832
That makes two of us.

523
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,960
Do you think that's possible?

524
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,255
With your help, yes.

525
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,842
It's just a question of looking
at whatever it is your father gave you.

526
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,468
It's just...

527
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,555
It's just a key.

528
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,266
Well, we'll figure it out.

529
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,476
Together.

530
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,691
I like the sound of that.

531
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,779
Me too.

532
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,006
Hello, Paul.

533
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,093
Madame President, it's been a while.

534
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,597
I know. I'm calling to apologize.

535
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,850
Okay.

536
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,521
I'm so sorry.
It all just got away from me.

537
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,859
And I ended up hurting the one person
who's always been at my side.

538
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,777
I want you to come home, Paul.

539
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,030
We can fix this together.

540
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,990
But not with those brothers...

541
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:19,786
...running around the country, tearing
down the very office you helped me build.

542
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,164
Caroline.

543
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,041
I want to make it up to you.

544
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,876
Please bring them in, Paul...

545
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,504
...and everything can go back
to the way it was.

546
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,054
I have to go now. I'll see you soon.

547
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,521
Did you talk to Sara?

548
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,985
In a few days, this should all be over,
one way or the other.

549
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,906
Absolutely.
