1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,711
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,713
- What are the charges?
- Attempted murder.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,008
<i>He's also arraigned for the murder</i>
<i>of his mother and his stepfather.</i>

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,303
Don't look at me like I'm some con.
You're as crooked as scoliosis.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,055
I don't get caught.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,973
This is as far as you go.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,018
- Come on, bro.
- You and I, we're not bros.

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,067
When were you planning on
telling us about the money?

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,944
- What money?
- Five million dollars...

10
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,697
...that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,075
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,868
What? You found Steadman?

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,078
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,920
My hand has been in that box
for hours now. It is dying.

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,423
- I can promise you nothing.
- Story of my life.

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,009
- And these?
- The keys to a car that's waiting for us.

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,929
- A couple hundred yards.
- That a two-of-us or a five-of-us?

18
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,265
- That's a two-of-us.
- We got company.

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,892
How did he know?

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,645
<i>MAHONE. It is only a matter of</i>
<i>time before we know everything...</i>

21
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,689
<i>...that is in Scofield's head.</i>

22
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,191
<i>Where he plans to run to,</i>
<i>how he plans to get there.</i>

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,610
<i>So when the time comes</i>
<i>that he does get there...</i>

24
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,195
...we'll be waiting for him.

25
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,950
Canadian and Mexican
<i>border patrols have the mug shots.</i>

26
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,243
<i>BORTAC's on high alert.</i>

27
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,622
See if we can get Mexican border patrol
to set up checkpoints 50 miles in.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,792
<i>The warden over at Fox River</i>
<i>called, asked to be kept in the loop.</i>

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,628
<i>- What should I tell him?</i>
- That he's no longer in it.

30
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,548
That info that you asked for
is on your desk when you get in.

31
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,133
<i>Thank you.</i>

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,874
<i>What's the plan, man?</i>

33
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,669
No bars on these
doors. Do what you like.

34
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,879
With what?

35
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,632
We're supposed to be in Mexico,
sipping on margaritas...

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,135
...waiting for the heat to dip.
That was the plan.

37
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,973
See? they just used us to dig, right?
We're gophers.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,891
- Where's Michael?
- He'll be here.

39
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,893
Okay. You know what, Sucre?

40
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,397
Maybe you and I should go and get that
$5 million, know what I'm saying?

41
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,526
- It's sitting there in Tooele, ready to get.
- You wanna stay, shut your mouth.

42
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,028
- You've got one more time to touch me.
- Guys, chill.

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,655
- What?
- Hey!

44
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,661
Relax.

45
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,508
Honey, are you sure
you packed everything?

46
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,933
Yummy.

47
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,813
Mm.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,985
Our photos are in the paper.
They're all over the news.

49
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,029
Yeah, and you didn't see that coming?

50
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,869
- What's so funny?
- The two of you. Cracks me up.

51
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,455
Here's to amateur hour.

52
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,250
- What do you say?
- Yeah, yuk it up, funnyman.

53
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,715
Last supper, boys.

54
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,470
This is the part where we say goodbye.

55
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,389
It's not much.

56
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,475
It's enough to get you started.

57
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,647
- Hey...
- No.

58
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,775
- I'm not telling you where Fibonacci is.
- Well, I didn't ask.

59
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,280
I only ask for a quarter
for a phone call.

60
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,282
Make four.

61
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,117
Thank you.

62
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,829
I wonder what happened
to the other guys.

63
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,833
They all had a head start.
Except for T-Bag.

64
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:57,004
Yeah, he was bleeding pretty bad.

65
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,757
Think he's dead?

66
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,266
Are you done?

67
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,354
- No, I still have to clean it.
- But you're done?

68
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,273
Yes.

69
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>It's time to move.</i>

70
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,967
We got everything we need.

71
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,720
Just a quick stop in Utah
and then we're off to Mexico.

72
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,099
L.J. has a hearing today
to determine if he gets tried as an adult.

73
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,226
I can get him.

74
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,521
- It's not the right time.
- When will it be?

75
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,190
After we go to Mexico.
After we're off the news.

76
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,109
They framed him for a double homicide.

77
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,987
Soon as he loses his hearing,
they're gonna ship him out.

78
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,032
So today in the courthouse
is my only chance to get him.

79
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,285
They took Veronica.
They're not gonna take my son.

80
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,953
I know.

81
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,413
I know.

82
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,666
I would never leave L.J. behind.

83
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,920
But we can't do this now.
There's no plan in place.

84
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,089
Believe me, I know that courthouse.

85
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,341
I've been there more times
than I can remember.

86
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,553
The person guarding him's the bailiff.
He carries Mace and a stick.

87
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,015
So you're gonna bum-rush
the courthouse. That's your plan.

88
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,726
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,603
Y'all, we're headed out, man.

90
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,025
Well, good luck to everyone.

91
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,611
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,784
This is it, papi.

93
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,288
- I hope you find the girl, buddy.
- She's all I have.

94
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,956
I'll die trying.

95
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,421
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you be easy, man.

96
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,766
Maybe we'll see each other again.

97
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,477
You never know, Michael.

98
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,145
You never know.

99
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,667
Tell me everything you know
about the courthouse.

100
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,092
- You get any sleep?
- Couple hours.

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,052
Eight of them.
I still can't believe it.

102
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,806
Exhibit A why you don't let women
work in the military or the police force...

103
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,976
...especially inside a male prison.
Because look what you get.

104
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,729
Dr. Sweetcheeks leaves the door open
for Scofield...

105
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,732
- ...and here we are.
- Sounds like there's more to the escape--

106
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,443
If Tancredi doesn't leave
her office door unlocked...

107
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,446
...those eight dirtbags
would be in the SHU right now, okay?

108
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,990
- Bottom line!
- Brad.

109
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,035
- Any update?
- None.

110
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,579
They were last seen
at that cemetery in Oswego.

111
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,623
- We'll get them.
- They'll get them.

112
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,584
- It's been handed to the FBI.
- Doesn't mean we can't work it.

113
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,085
It does, actually.

114
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,380
- You and I are pulled off the pursuit.
- Why?

115
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,800
We're going to find out shortly.
We have to report to DOC headquarters.

116
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,595
- I will meet you there.
- Sir, we can get these guys.

117
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,223
- Give me a couple days and I swear I--
- Brad.

118
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,977
We've got to go.

119
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,080
No family with Patoshik? Nothing?

120
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,459
Yeah. Until about four
years ago, when he killed them all.

121
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,797
Updated rap sheet on Apolskis.
Take a look when you get a chance.

122
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,357
You have to use the key
that we keep in the grill because that's--

123
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,112
Man, I'm so sorry.

124
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,989
It's my bad. My bad, bro.

125
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,740
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,883
"Scott Kolbrenner."

127
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,022
It's this one here.

128
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,941
Don't touch the radio.

129
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,705
Hi. I'm with the Des Moies Herald,
I'm covering the L.J. Burrows hearing.

130
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,957
What time's that start today?

131
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,225
Come on.

132
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,012
Thank you. Three o'clock.
The hearing lasts a half-hour max.

133
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,432
He'll be taken down to Transport Bay
at 10 till to catch the 4:00 van.

134
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,934
How do we get close to him?

135
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,854
Well, when I was locked up, I had
nothing to do except study the briefs.

136
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,941
Nick Savrinn's bar number
was on the front page of every one.

137
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,401
We wanna talk to L.J., we--

138
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,736
- We pose as one of his attorneys.
- Yeah.

139
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,741
<i>Hogwash. That is absolute hogwash.</i>

140
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,618
Please answer the question.

141
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,913
How was Scofield able
to have exclusive access to you...

142
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,332
...pull a shank on you
and bind you to your chair?

143
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,960
The warden of the penitentiary.

144
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,129
I trusted him.

145
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,881
Obviously, he betrayed that trust.

146
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,968
Officer Bellick...

147
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:46,265
...is it true that almost all the inmates
who either escaped or tried to escape...

148
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,226
- ...worked in Prison Industries?
- That's right.

149
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,228
Why did these inmates
have so much time...

150
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,730
...to dig a hole in the floor
of the guards' room...

151
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,483
- ...while working Prison Industries?
- I can answer that.

152
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,278
If any of you
have ever worked a day in a prison...

153
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,114
...you would know
since an inmate gets 19 cents an hour...

154
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,617
...some are bound to drag their feet.

155
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,829
Officer Bellick...

156
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:13,000
...is it true you sold the right to run
Prison Industries to the highest bidder?

157
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,503
- No. Who the hell told you that?
- This is unbelievable.

158
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,258
While we're wasting time in here,
there are eight convicts out there--

159
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,903
Were you employed at Fox
River as a correctional officer, Mr. Geary?

160
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,112
- Yep.
- Yeah...

161
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,531
...until he was fired
for shaking down inmates.

162
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,326
That'll be your last outburst, officer.

163
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,162
Were you aware of any arrangement
Officer Bellick had...

164
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,165
...with any inmate
regarding Prison Industries?

165
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,875
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

166
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,545
John Abruzzi,
who is one of the escaped convicts?

167
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,005
Yep.

168
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,091
We'll get other C.O.'s to
substantiate this if we have to...

169
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,094
...so I'm giving you one chance
to get in front of it.

170
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,765
Did you sell Prison Industries
to John Abruzzi?

171
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,269
Yes or no?

172
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,899
- Yes. But at no time was I aware of--
That'll be all, Officer Bellick.

173
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,109
That will be all.

174
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,321
Warden, you and Officer Bellick
can step out into the hallway.

175
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,157
We'll call for you
when we've reached a decision.

176
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,185
I'm gonna get some coffee.

177
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,315
Well, I did my best
under the circumstances.

178
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,652
The good news, sir,
is you had the hand iced...

179
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,656
...so I was able to restore blood flow
and the bones are pinned.

180
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,826
However, I recommend
you get medical attention ASAP.

181
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,997
Meanwhile, some aspirin. It'll help
thin the blood and avoid clotting.

182
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,000
Antibiotics, some painkillers.

183
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,337
I usually tell the owner of the dog,
cat, whatever...

184
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,257
...to coat them with peanut butter
so they're easier to chew.

185
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,260
- But obviously, in your case--
- You did one hell of a job, doc.

186
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,012
Well, thank you.

187
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,473
Well, it's okay for you to leave now.

188
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,475
Oh, I'm leaving.

189
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,353
- And you're not.
- What?

190
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,189
- You heard me.
- Look, sir, I haven't seen anything...

191
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,441
...and I won't tell anyone.

192
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:48,530
You know, I fell for
that bill of goods once before.

193
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,948
Never again.

194
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,203
- Sir, I swear to God I will tell nobody.
- You would.

195
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,788
And I would die in prison.

196
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,464
- Please, please, please.
- Shh. Shh.

197
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,218
Now, you did me a solid,
so I'm gonna return the favor.

198
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,805
This can go down humanely
if you don't fight.

199
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:19,394
But if you pull a stunt like that again,
it's gonna get inhumane right quick.

200
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,854
Your call.

201
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,065
But one way or another...

202
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,277
...I am putting you down, doc.

203
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,541
- Lincoln Burrows Jr.?
- Yeah.

204
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,418
In here. You got a visitor.

205
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,431
You must be L.J.

206
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,062
Agent Mahone, FBI. Thank you.

207
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,941
Please.

208
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,571
I'm assuming you've heard.

209
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,366
Yeah.

210
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,120
I have to tell you,
what your dad and uncle pulled off...

211
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,083
Very impressive.
I've been doing this 14 years...

212
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:27,796
...and most escapes can be attributed
to dumb luck or brute force.

213
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,258
The level of planning and sophistication
that went into this one...

214
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,719
...and eight guys got out...

215
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,764
I really do, professionally speaking...

216
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,934
...have a lot of admiration
for Lincoln and Michael.

217
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,478
Cool. Now we're buddies.

218
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,608
What do you need?

219
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,237
Help me bring them in peacefully.

220
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,156
I don't know where they are.

221
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,492
- I don't know where they're going.
- There's another way you can help.

222
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,911
- How?
- Go on TV.

223
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,583
I can have a camera crew down here
in a half an hour.

224
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,633
You know what, man?
The murder charge they put on my dad...

225
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,969
...the two murder charges
they put on me...

226
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,513
...everything's been a setup,
coming from way up top.

227
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,433
So the fact that you work
for the government...

228
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,978
I got nothing to say.

229
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,947
I'll give you the same advice you'd get
from the guy working at the deli.

230
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,408
Start thinking about yourself now.

231
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,536
In fact, the sooner the better,
because no one...

232
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,498
...not your father, L.J., not your uncle...

233
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,625
...is going to do your time.

234
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,462
And at 16 years old,
you're looking at a long stretch.

235
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,382
How much time you get,
where you serve it...

236
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,843
...who your cellmate might be.

237
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,392
You need to start thinking
about yourself now.

238
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,146
I want your dad, I want your uncle,
and I'm willing to deal.

239
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,068
Don't wait and let someone else
get the reward.

240
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,419
What's up?

241
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,880
Hey, man, you look familiar.

242
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,678
Did you rush Sig Ep last semester?

243
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,680
- Sig what?
- Sig Ep.

244
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,394
- No.
- Next in line.

245
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,564
Where to?

246
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,691
Utah.

247
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,456
How we doing here?

248
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,295
Nothing until tomorrow.

249
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,133
All right, yo, I got 45 bucks.

250
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,468
How far will that get me?

251
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:36,109
Nick Savrinn. Bar number is 56437.

252
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,487
I got a call time with my client,
L.J. Burrows.

253
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,662
- Hello.
- Know who this is?

254
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,664
Yeah.

255
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,583
Yeah, Nick Savrinn.

256
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,084
How you holding up?

257
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,253
Doing what I can do.

258
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,005
<i>How about you?</i>

259
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,799
I'm worried about you.

260
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,260
- Sorry about what you're going through.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

261
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:08,350
Word is after this hearing, because of
my dad being so high-profile, they're--

262
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,771
They're shipping me to an adult facility
in Kingman, Arizona.

263
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,690
Yeah, well,
hopefully that ain't gonna happen.

264
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,359
You hear from Veronica today?

265
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,196
She didn't show up. They gave me
some court-appointed clown.

266
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,700
No, I haven't heard from her.

267
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,620
Hey, this fed came by
and talked to me today.

268
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,789
Yeah?

269
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,750
<i>He wanted me to help try</i>
<i>in getting my dad to turn himself in.</i>

270
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,294
Well, knowing your dad,
I doubt that's gonna happen.

271
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,171
Listen up, this is real important.

272
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:43,176
- All right.
- On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

273
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,305
<i>You got that?</i>
<i>On the third, look out for Otis Wright.</i>

274
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,224
Until then, keep your head up.

275
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,351
- What?
<i>- Just remember that.</i>

276
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,561
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get you out.

277
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,021
Hey, Nick.

278
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,065
If you talk to my dad...

279
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,734
<i>...tell him no matter what, I love him.</i>

280
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,785
- Hey.
- Hey.

281
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,080
- Did you get him?
- Let's do this.

282
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,542
We got one more stop.

283
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,972
There is a belief in my religion
which I know to be true...

284
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,267
...and it applies to everyone,
Hindu or not.

285
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,564
The acts we commit in this life
determine where we go in the next.

286
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,943
And he who commits evil
can never hope for eternal happiness.

287
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,363
Never been a goal of mine, doc.

288
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,949
I'm more a here-and-now type.

289
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,288
I'll tell you something I know is true.

290
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:57,792
The Indians here,
the tomahawk variety...

291
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,210
...some of them believe--

292
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,589
Well, used to believe, before most
of them were slaughtered.

293
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:08,553
--That when a warrior
kills another in battle...

294
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:14,059
...he absorbs
that fallen warrior's spirit.

295
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,563
So this isn't the end for you, doc.

296
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,818
You're with me now.

297
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,850
And how are you doing this fine day?

298
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,518
Uh...

299
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,395
I'm great. How are you?

300
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,149
Couldn't be better. Anything
in particular I can help you find?

301
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,608
Just looking. Thanks.

302
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,361
Well, if you need any assistance,
just give a holler.

303
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,266
- How are we this fine day?
- Great.

304
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,102
- Can I help you find anything?
- I'm good, thanks.

305
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,651
Hey, we gotta go.

306
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,278
- I just need to pay up.
- Now.

307
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,073
How are you today, officer?

308
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,831
Yeah, they were right...

309
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,753
Well, they were right back here.

310
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,343
We can make it
to the courthouse on foot.

311
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,179
You don't understand.
Everything is in that car.

312
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,473
Forget the damn car.
We don't have time.

313
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,099
Come on, man, let's go.

314
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,329
- Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,536
It is the finding
of this panel, Warden Pope...

316
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:05,415
...you'll be docked two weeks,
placed on three months' probation.

317
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,584
Officer Brad Bellick...

318
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,421
...will be terminated,
effective immediately.

319
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,425
Mr. Bellick, you can retrieve whatever
belongings you may have from Fox River.

320
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,093
That'll be all.

321
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:22,557
I've worked at Fox River
since I was 18 years old.

322
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,101
Being a C.O. is my life.

323
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,728
And we appreciate that.

324
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,731
We could've saved a lot of time
if you would've just told us...

325
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,733
...that this was gonna be a railroad.

326
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,444
- That'll be all.
- There is only one person responsible...

327
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,779
...for this escape.
His name is Michael Scofield.

328
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:40,033
It's not Officer Bellick. It's not me!

329
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,077
But you need a fall guy, fine.

330
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,955
But you're not gonna be
just taking Officer Bellick's job.

331
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,833
Because even though I am not proud
of many of his actions...

332
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:53,629
...it will be a cold day in hell when
I turn my back on one of my own men.

333
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,424
I quit.

334
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,634
That will be all.

335
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,183
If this thing doesn't work out and
you end up going back to Fox River...

336
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,560
...I ain't coming to get you.

337
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:11,522
I mean, you are the brains
and I am the brute.

338
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,739
Seriously, Michael,
you don't have to do this.

339
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,796
Let's go.

340
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,079
We're good.

341
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,292
You got a call from Nick Savrinn
earlier today. What was that all about?

342
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,795
He's my attorney. That's privileged.

343
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:19,340
That's odd, because Nick Savrinn
was found dead in his apartment...

344
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,843
...an hour before that call came into you.

345
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,345
<i>L.J., this is important.</i>

346
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,640
<i>- . All right.</i>
- On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

347
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,933
<i>You got that?</i>

348
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,686
For someone who's convinced
the government is capable...

349
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,815
...of so many underhanded things, you
sure are playing fast and loose with me.

350
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,776
What are you gonna do, throw
another fake murder charge on me?

351
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,529
- Who's Otis Wright?
- I have no idea.

352
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,158
I think you do. And if you don't tell me,
after you're convicted...

353
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,620
...I will be in that courtroom when you're
sentenced, and I'll hang you out to dry.

354
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,164
Take it to the bank.

355
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:42,340
Yeah, put me in touch with
the prosecutor in the L.J. Burrows case.

356
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,011
I want a meeting.

357
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,019
<i>On the third, look out for Otis Wright.</i>

358
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,860
<i>Until then, keep your head up.</i>

359
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,702
<i>Otis Wright.</i>

360
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,205
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

361
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,921
- Move it.
- Hold on.

362
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,704
I'll escort the boy.

363
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,720
Otis Wright.
Otis elevator on the right.

364
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,680
What is he planning?

365
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,226
Keep it in the holster
and no one gets hurt.

366
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,438
Keep it in the holster.

367
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,941
All right. L.J., hit stop.

368
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:31,907
He's coming with us, so just stay cool.
Stay cool.

369
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,620
Hey, buddy, give me his gun.

370
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,043
Hey, hey.

371
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,635
L.J., give me your hand.

372
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,096
Thattaboy. Come on.

373
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,148
Hey, back off. Back off. Back off.

374
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,317
You're not shooting anybody.
Neither are you.

375
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,361
Give yourself up and your kid can walk.

376
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,989
That's the only way he's getting out
of this place. It's the only way.

377
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,492
Dad.

378
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,787
Dad!

379
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,791
- Dad, you gotta let me go.
- No.

380
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,709
Dad.

381
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,381
You gotta let me go.

382
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,143
Up there. Scofield is in the building.
Take him.

383
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:46,857
You guys, go. Cover that way.
Scofield and Burrows are in the building.

384
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,734
Come on.

385
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,699
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

386
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,826
- Truck.
- Stop or we will shoot.

387
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,703
Stop!

388
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,800
Two suspects heading south on Liberty.

389
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,803
Bradley?

390
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,722
Yeah, Ma?

391
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,933
What are you doing home so early?

392
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,394
Well, I had to take...

393
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,441
...my personal days, you know,
before they went away.

394
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,360
Shouldn't you be looking
for the convicts?

395
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,280
Well, they got somebody else
doing that, Ma.

396
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,199
You okay?

397
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,669
I'm good.

398
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,880
Okay.

399
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,906
Whoa.

400
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,993
All right.

401
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,620
We should break
a bottle of champagne across its bow.

402
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,874
If you're intending to get this home
for your anniversary tonight...

403
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,376
- ...I wouldn't recommend it.
- No.

404
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,880
Listen, I want you to know, I...

405
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,049
Well, I feel very fortunate
to have met you.

406
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,723
I'm breaking out.

407
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,809
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.

408
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,892
<i>Thank you for calling AutoStar, Dr. Gudat.</i>

409
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,436
<i>- Am I pronouncing that correctly?</i>
- Uh...

410
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:38,232
- Dead on.
<i>- How can I help you today?</i>

411
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,986
I need directions.

412
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,322
<i>- Where to, sir?</i>
- Utah.

413
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,670
Excuse me.

414
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,088
I'm sorry.

415
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,506
Are you Scott Kolbrenner?

416
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,344
I am, yeah.

417
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,013
You must be Debra Jean.

418
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,306
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, same here.

419
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,767
I was almost ready to leave
when you called.

420
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,185
No one else responded.

421
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,522
I guess there's not a lot of Utah people
out here. Are you from there?

422
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,275
No, I just, you know...

423
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:25,279
I'm headed out there
to collect an inheritance.

424
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,698
- My grandpa died.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

425
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,826
It's all right.
He went out with his boots on.

426
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,619
So where's your stuff?

427
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,873
Uh... I mailed it yesterday.

428
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,709
Mailed it? I've never heard of that.

429
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,212
You don't wanna lug it around.
Plus, I got a boy who works for UPS.

430
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,548
So he hooked it up.

431
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,928
So you wanna bounce?

432
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,018
Okay. I'm parked out front.

433
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,655
Bradley?

434
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,074
Yeah, Ma?

435
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,786
They just announced the rewards
on the TV.

436
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,580
- What reward?
- The convicts.

437
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,416
For the convicts.
The ones who escaped.

438
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,420
- How much?
- A hundred thousand dollars apiece.

439
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:27,758
Three hundred thousand for the animal
who killed President Reynolds' brother.

440
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,803
Every whacko in the country's
gonna be after those bums now...

441
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,763
...wouldn't you say?

442
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,355
Police!

443
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,359
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

444
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,043
- We gotta move.
- I can't.

445
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,586
Oh!

446
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,298
Oh, my God.

447
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,308
I failed him.

448
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,986
I failed him.

449
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:39,037
I sure hope you packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long ride to Arizona.

450
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,540
Move your ass.

451
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:12,321
Get men in all the area hospitals.
Wherever they are, one's bleeding good.

452
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:17,492
Which means they either come to us
or they die.
