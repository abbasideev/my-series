1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,627
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,048
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,800
You can't kill.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,093
I will get you.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,886
This is...

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,223
...in case you run into trouble
down the road.

7
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,725
Lincoln, he really wants to see you
and your brother.

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,269
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was 10 years old.

9
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,479
Let's go.

10
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,357
Michael never met
your grandfather. Dad.

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,693
- I got Burrows.
- Take care of them.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,070
<i>You think there's a</i>
<i>part of you that enjoys this?</i>

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,531
It feels to me like chasing a high...

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,701
...and I should know better by now.

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,411
Sara?

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,416
Hi, Sara.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,334
Hey, what is this?

18
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:47,213
It's for my blood pressure.

19
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,757
- Geary, come on. We can make a deal.
- No deals.

20
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,218
You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,637
Ain't that the most beautiful thing
you ever seen?

22
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,245
This is the Tribune police.

23
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,756
This is the Tribune police.
Make yourself known.

24
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,095
Code 4. All clear.

25
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,981
Hey, you're in luck.

26
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,151
- I had a case in back.
- Excellent.

27
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,154
Fishing reel oil.

28
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,073
And you want the whole case?

29
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,160
Whole case.

30
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,163
And the GPS?

31
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,126
- And the GPS.
- Must do quite a bit of fishing.

32
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,546
Yeah, a lot of fishing.
Not a whole lot of catching.

33
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,467
Ninety-six dollars and 23 cents.

34
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,266
You know, um...

35
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,102
I'm just gonna take the reel oil.

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,827
Hey, you have to pay for that.

38
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,878
Just take it. Please don't hurt me.

39
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,964
Please.

40
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,188
<i>You have to pay for that.</i>

41
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,858
The vault. Open it.

42
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>Come on, pretty.</i>

43
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,534
I wasn't going
<i>for me, I was going for my daughter.</i>

44
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,245
Give Emma her papa's love.

45
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm gonna cut your throat out.

46
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,920
I loved you, Michael,
but you just used me.

47
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,717
Cops found your girlfriend, fish-belly
white, gargling in her own puke.

48
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,053
And what do you care? As long as
she left the door open for you.

49
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>I feel very fortunate to have met you.</i>

50
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,685
I'm sorry, Henry.

51
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,960
It's corporate interests
taking over the government...

52
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,213
...buying elections, fighting wars.

53
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,799
People dying so they can turn a profit.

54
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,052
We're trying to stop it.

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,721
What are you, a bunch of spies?

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,265
Just a handful
of senators, congressmen.

57
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,101
People like me
that once worked for The Company.

58
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,146
People willing to expose
the president for what she is.

59
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,398
A shill working for these corporations.

60
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,443
We bring her down,
we bring them down.

61
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,028
What's it got to do with me?

62
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,738
The way we'll bring her down...

63
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,324
...is also what we're gonna use
to set you free.

64
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,826
About a week ago,
we finally got a break.

65
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,246
<i>An NSA analyst</i>
<i>sympathetic to our cause...</i>

66
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,501
<i>...finally worked his way up and got</i>
<i>clearance into the Echelon program.</i>

67
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,505
<i>E-mails, cell-phone calls</i>
<i>all across this country.</i>

68
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,966
<i>If it's transmitted,</i>
<i>it goes through Echelon.</i>

69
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,011
<i>It's cataloged, interpreted,</i>
<i>and then stored for Homeland Security.</i>

70
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,805
Nothing is missed by them.

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,264
Nothing.

72
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:12,979
Including, by accident,
for a few months after 9/11...

73
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,981
<i>...the White House.</i>

74
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,151
<i>The analyst got his hands on a</i>
<i>phone conversation the president had...</i>

75
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:24,031
...with Terrence Steadman, two weeks
after you supposedly killed him.

76
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>The analyst tried to get</i>
<i>this information out of the building.</i>

77
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,957
Excuse me. Could you come with us?
We need to ask you a few questions, sir.

78
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,959
<i>Turns out someone</i>
<i>else was snooping too.</i>

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,217
Someone else wanted answers
about the president.

80
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,887
I'm convinced
they're turning the...

81
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,724
- Aldo and Lincoln wanna be left alone.
- Sure, I understand.

82
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,733
Twenty-four hours later,
Tancredi's dead, the analyst is missing...

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,362
...and the White House Echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

84
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,075
The tape is still out there.

85
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,162
And judging by how hard they're going
after Sara Tancredi...

86
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,956
...I'm pretty sure they think she has it.

87
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,792
And I think they're right.

88
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,920
She's the key
to this whole thing, Lincoln.

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,875
L.J., come with me.

90
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,101
I would imagine...

91
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,897
...that you're feeling
slightly betrayed right now.

92
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,691
I understand.

93
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,536
As you can see...

94
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,290
...hi, my name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

95
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,168
Okay.

96
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,086
There's one thing about me...

97
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,589
...that should mean a great deal to you
right now...

98
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,716
...and that is,
I am reasonable.

99
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,886
If you tell me what you know,
you get to go.

100
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,305
And then maybe,
when this is all behind us...

101
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,308
...we get to grab a piece of pie
for old time's sake.

102
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,851
Okay? Come here.

103
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,193
I don't know where Michael is.

104
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,779
This is not about Michael,
this is about your father.

105
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,199
He left Washington with something
that didn't belong to him...

106
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,951
...and we need it back.

107
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,953
- And you killed him for it.
- I didn't.

108
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,789
No, for what that's worth.

109
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,000
But I hope that his death
properly illustrates...

110
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,587
...the magnitude of the situation
that we're in right now.

111
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,551
So where is it?

112
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,809
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where is it?

113
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

114
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,148
Sara, there's a next step
involved in this...

115
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,943
...and you don't
want to experience that.

116
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,617
I swear to God,
I don't know what you're talking about.

117
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,328
My father didn't give me anything.

118
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,623
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,607
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

120
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,901
How long has it been
since your last confession?

121
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,278
This is my first time...

122
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,864
...in a long time.

123
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,992
And what are the nature of your sins?

124
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,870
The nature?

125
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm not really sure.

126
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,252
Deep down
inside your heart you know.

127
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,006
Righteousness, maybe.

128
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,426
Believing the ends justify the means.

129
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,720
And what are those ends?

130
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,972
Saving someone's life.

131
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,808
And the means?

132
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,562
I've broken just about
every law you can name.

133
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,940
But it's not just what I've done.

134
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,860
It's what others have done...

135
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,572
...because I let them.

136
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,159
Because I was doing
what I thought was right.

137
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,245
- I should have known better this time.
- This time?

138
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,293
When I was a kid...

139
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,715
...I watched a man bleed out and die.

140
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,261
And I was glad...

141
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,431
...because he deserved it.

142
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,017
Life is only for God
to give and take, my son.

143
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,604
Suddenly, there was this
dark space inside of me...

144
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,565
...and I knew it was wrong.

145
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,780
- But here I am.
- There is a way to stop this.

146
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,740
Surrender your will to God.

147
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,326
If I surrender now...

148
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,413
...I lose everything I love.

149
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,875
But do you lose your soul
in the process?

150
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,257
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

151
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,472
You okay?

152
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,728
This is never gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming after us.

153
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,122
Lincoln, don't.

154
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,502
- Is it done?
- You are.

155
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,341
- Lincoln Burrows.
- Your man's dead.

156
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,970
Just like anyone else you send
to take out my son.

157
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,433
We want you.
This isn't about L.J.

158
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,853
There's a very simple way
for all of this to end.

159
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,229
I'll tell you how it'll end.

160
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,524
Me staring into your dead eye
with my hand around your throat.

161
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,861
You don't even know who I am.

162
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,370
How much further?

163
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,216
Right here is good.

164
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,176
Right. You got it.

165
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,101
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

166
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,130
Agent Mahone. Bill Kim.

167
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,507
I'm here to pick you up.

168
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,343
I called Kellerman.

169
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,470
He's busy right now.

170
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,808
- Does anyone else know you're here?
- No.

171
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,352
- Good.
- Can you open the gate?

172
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,022
And I need a new vehicle.

173
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,358
There's something
you should know about me.

174
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,904
I don't like being out in the field.
I only do so when there's a screw up.

175
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,659
I'm out in the field, Alex.

176
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,161
Why don't you open the gate...

177
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,748
...and you can hurry back to D.C.
before your shoes get dirty?

178
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,668
We have a lead as to where Burrows
will meet with his brother.

179
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,379
It's a place he referred
to as Bolshoi Booze.

180
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,797
That mean anything to you?

181
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,550
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos
on Scofield's body.

182
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,178
- What does it mean?
- I don't know yet.

183
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,764
You need to figure it out
in the next couple of hours.

184
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,517
If Scofield and Burrows cross the border,
they'll be out of your jurisdiction...

185
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,228
...and you'll be of no
further value to us.

186
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,692
- Open the gate.
- So you can do what?

187
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,403
I wanna hear it.
Straight from the mouth of the guy...

188
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,988
...who's supposed to be our closer.

189
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,950
I'll get Scofield and Burrows
and all the rest of them.

190
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,954
And then me and you and Kellerman...

191
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,706
...we're gonna part ways.

192
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,250
I just hope you're properly motivated.

193
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,765
Because as long as you do your job,
we forget about Shales.

194
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,981
And then you can go back to Colorado
and visit your son, Cameron.

195
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,984
He's 5, right?

196
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,446
Don't you ever mention
his name again.

197
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,242
There he is.

198
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,287
That's what I wanted to hear.

199
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,752
Get cracking, Alex.

200
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,005
A lot of people are relying on you.

201
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,806
Jane will take care of it.
You can trust her.

202
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,478
I know this is hard, but it will work out.
You have my word.

203
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,482
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

204
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,035
Listen...

205
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,414
I know.

206
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,585
Jane's gonna look after you.

207
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,837
- I don't even know her.
- She's all right.

208
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,590
She's been working for Dad
for a while.

209
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,884
I'll...

210
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,345
I'll see you soon, I promise.

211
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,475
Isn't that the same thing
your dad told you?

212
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,518
Yeah, but I mean it.

213
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,230
Hey.

214
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,821
Bo-- No.

215
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,448
Hey, it's me.

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,286
Just call me when you get this, okay?
It's important.

217
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,947
They're numbers.

218
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,172
Is that my payment?

219
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,386
- Medical nitroglycerin?
- As promised.

220
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,977
Ooh.

221
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,897
You have no idea how hard it is
to get this kind of grade.

222
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,316
Even with my contacts.

223
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:02,070
It's time for your end of the deal.
Where's that plane gonna be?

224
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,825
They call me a couple of hours
before with the drop-off point.

225
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,702
Keeps the DEA off our backs.

226
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,289
So it's gonna be a while.
You might wanna stay out of the sun.

227
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,339
Hey, hey, hey.

228
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,008
Hey.

229
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,885
Is there a problem?

230
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,054
They're just my cousins.

231
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,111
Now, after your father accessed
this information...

232
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,241
...he made three calls
from his cell phone, all to you.

233
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,701
What did he tell you?

234
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,120
Just that he was coming back
to Chicago.

235
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,331
Good. You're being honest. Good.

236
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,626
Now, there's a half an hour
between when your father landed...

237
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,337
...and when he got home
that is unaccounted for.

238
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,798
I know you stopped by his office.
You see him there?

239
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,467
No.

240
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,094
The last time I saw my father,
he was dead in his study.

241
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,721
He have anyone
give you anything?

242
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,433
You think I'm withholding information
because I like hanging out with you?

243
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,643
If I knew something,
I would tell you. I don't.

244
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,771
I don't know anything
about any of this.

245
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:22,650
Really? Then why did you give your
father the file on Lincoln Burrows?

246
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,028
Why open the door for Scofield,
help him escape?

247
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,155
Why did Scofield send you
those coded notes?

248
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,825
Why did you come to New Mexico
to meet him?

249
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,247
Don't try to float
a babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

250
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,625
It's really gonna piss me off.

251
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,627
So come on.

252
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,062
Okay, come on.

253
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,438
Shh. Shh. Shh.

254
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,190
You're okay.

255
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,152
All right.

256
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,535
Look, Sara...

257
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:18,540
...we're gonna have to come to an
understanding. You know that, right?

258
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,883
<i>You were right. They are coordinates.</i>

259
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,428
Plug them into your GPS. It'll take you
to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

260
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,722
It's in the middle of nowhere, basically.

261
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,225
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

262
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,893
<i>Sir, who are you meeting--?</i>

263
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,230
What the hell is he doing?

264
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,441
He's keeping us out of the loop,
that's what he's doing.

265
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,196
You know, constantly running
from the law with a bad heart.

266
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,950
Mexico, where I'm from,
has got a lot of great things...

267
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,244
...but health care ain't one of them.

268
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,831
You all right? You look a little nervous.

269
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,457
I don't do this every day.

270
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:06,337
I just wanna get the information
on that plane and move on.

271
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,257
- Is that it?
- That's it.

272
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,095
Because I know who you are.
Oh, you don't have to worry.

273
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,765
We can't go within 100 feet of a
federal marshal to collect the reward...

274
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,269
...because we got U.S.
and Mexican warrants on our head.

275
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:26,149
But this plane to Panama...
Sit down.

276
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,285
- This is all for your brother?
- Yes.

277
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,747
I got four brothers. Two in prison.

278
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:44,500
Accept a call? Yes.
But break them out?

279
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,923
My brother gave me a baseball mitt
for my 14th birthday.

280
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,299
I owed him.

281
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,301
You're a better man than I am.

282
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,428
Time will tell.

283
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,232
Shouldn't they have called by now
about the plane?

284
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,983
Yeah.

285
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,737
But you know, I have a question.

286
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,950
I thought that these
came in glass vials...

287
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,452
...not plastic.

288
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,122
I thought so too.

289
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,833
The guy I bought it from
said he packed it in plastic...

290
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:30,755
...for transportation over long distances
to prevent a fire or an explosion.

291
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,632
Really?

292
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,176
I never heard of that.

293
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,354
What's going on?

294
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,773
We're gonna do
a little quality-control test.

295
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,191
It's the best available.

296
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,819
We got time.

297
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,605
For the last time, some black
male, early 20s, jumped me from behind.

298
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,316
Didn't get a good look at his face.

299
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,235
- Assailant attacked you from behind?
- That's what I just said.

300
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,612
Yet he managed to make contact
on your forehead.

301
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,324
- That's right.
- With what? A boomerang?

302
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,492
Come on, why don't you
tell me what happened?

303
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,829
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer
out of Illinois.

304
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,458
How about showing
some professional courtesy, honey?

305
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,052
<i>This is Roy Geary. Leave a message.</i>

306
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,928
You thieving son of a bitch.

307
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,307
You better get down on your knees
and pray to God that I don't find you.

308
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:09,145
Because if I do, mark my words,
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

309
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,567
<i>President Reynolds</i>
<i>was in Tallahassee, Florida this morning...</i>

310
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,653
<i>...attending a $5000-a-plate</i>
<i>breakfast fundraiser...</i>

311
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,948
<i>...for Senator Martin Kleinhenz,</i>
<i>who's running for reelection.</i>

312
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,826
<i>Later this afternoon,</i>
<i>her press conference was derailed...</i>

313
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:28,331
<i>...when a reporter asked her to comment</i>
<i>on Burrows' escape from custody.</i>

314
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,876
<i>She declined. It's become clear</i>
<i>in her first month in office...</i>

315
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,421
<i>...that she cannot separate herself</i>
<i>from this manhunt.</i>

316
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,964
<i>And as long as it continues...</i>

317
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,135
<i>...pundits say that questions</i>
<i>about Burrows will--</i>

318
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:49,185
Ladies. Let's get this party started.

319
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,604
For the last
30 years, I've hated you.

320
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,148
You walked out on me.

321
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,194
You haven't even seen Michael.

322
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,155
I've seen him before.

323
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,867
Not in the papers, Dad.

324
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,038
I've been trying to work out
what kind of man abandons his family.

325
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,960
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

326
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:19,048
You'll see him again.
I'll make sure of it.

327
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,388
- How much further?
- About three hours.

328
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,230
It's gonna be a few minutes.

329
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,898
My brother should be here soon.

330
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,067
I should go outside.
Make sure he can see me.

331
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,736
That's a good idea.
I'm gonna send Ernesto to do that.

332
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,294
Hello.

333
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,431
Was that the call?

334
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,017
- Yes, it was.
- About the plane?

335
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,192
Sugar water.

336
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,235
No, you just made
a big mistake, blanquito.

337
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,946
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
I'm not a chemist.

338
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:27,408
The guy I bought it from
swore it was medical nitro.

339
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,411
- We both got screwed.
- Yeah, but one of us is gonna pay for it.

340
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,872
I just wanna get out of here,
you want your payment.

341
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,082
My brother's gonna be here soon...

342
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,211
...we'll work something out.
Just name your price.

343
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,590
I already named my price.
You didn't come through.

344
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,812
When's your brother getting here?

345
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,815
You were planning on turning us in
the whole time, weren't you?

346
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,567
When's he supposed to meet you here?

347
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,030
- Drop it or I'm gonna shoot him.
- Let him go or I'll shoot you.

348
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,971
- Where is it?
- My father didn't give me anything.

349
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,767
Who are you risking your life for?

350
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,020
Lincoln Burrows.

351
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,940
A street thug.

352
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,361
Why is that your concern? Is there
somewhere in the Hippocratic oath...

353
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:49,323
...where it says, "I pledge to risk my life
for those who don't care about mine"?

354
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,534
Because they don't care about yours.

355
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:56,289
Burrows and Michael Scofield,
they just used you.

356
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,166
Are you that surprised
there are people in the world...

357
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,876
...who stand up to people like you?

358
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,797
- Are you that far gone?
- That's cute.

359
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,467
Sad, but cute.

360
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,068
A Cleveland what?

361
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,945
Don't worry, I'll talk you through it.

362
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,407
And we got a glass
coffee table right here.

363
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,995
- Hell, no.
- I'll do it for a thousand.

364
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,205
Five hundred.

365
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,166
One thousand.

366
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,501
Seven-fifty.

367
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,338
All right.

368
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,392
What the hell?

369
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,988
Leave.

370
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,619
You know...

371
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:21,290
...it's amazing what you can pick up
at an Army-Navy store.

372
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,627
All that torture stuff,
that was Bellick's idea.

373
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,672
And if you ask me,
he took the whole thing way too far.

374
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,384
Listen, why don't I just give you half
the money and we call it a day, huh?

375
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,802
All right, sixty-forty.

376
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,137
Come on, T, we can deal.

377
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,646
Where's the plane gonna land?

378
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,815
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

379
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,656
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

380
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,283
We won't get across the border
on the ground.

381
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
Without that plane,
we're screwed.

382
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,663
He's losing too much blood.
He'll never make it.

383
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,998
Should've thought of that
before he tried to kill us.

384
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,085
We gotta take him to the hospital
or else he'll die.

385
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,586
Please.

386
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,841
The plane, and we'll let you go.

387
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,938
Finley Road.

388
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,150
- Off Highway 8. There's an airstrip there.
- There.

389
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,818
Okay? Now, let us go.

390
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,319
- Okay, let's go.
- No, no, no.

391
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,947
- Michael, let's go.
- No, no, don't go.

392
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,199
- Please.
- Michael, let's go.

393
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,535
Please, help us.
No, don't do this, huh?

394
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,454
Don't do this. Don't do it. Please.

395
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,875
Let's go. Michael, if we were bleeding,
they would not lift a finger.

396
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,377
- He was gonna kill us. Let's go.
- That's not true.

397
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,254
Michael, we're gonna get to that plane.

398
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,797
- We'll call when we're safe.
- Don't do this.

399
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,216
- Let's go now, please.
- Please don't do this, okay?

400
00:34:55,594 --> 00:35:00,181
Don't do this! Don't do it,
all right? Don't listen to him! Please.

401
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,686
I care about you.

402
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,482
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

403
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,578
Kellerman.

404
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,413
<i>What's going on with Sara?</i>

405
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,415
<i>Has she told you anything?</i>

406
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,543
Don't go anywhere.

407
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,672
- Not yet.
<i>- I trust you've been persuasive.</i>

408
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,092
- Yes, absolutely.
- Then kill her.

409
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,264
Well, if she knows something...

410
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,102
You disobey me, you are done.
Do you understand me?

411
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,774
<i>Put her in the ground, Paul.</i>

412
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,449
Michael.

413
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,034
Let's go.

414
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,161
- Michael.
- Hold still.

415
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,747
You're doing it wrong.
Let's get out of here.

416
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,916
He was gonna call the cops,
get his buddies--

417
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,167
He's not gonna make it.

418
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:56,422
We'll call when we get safe.
Let's go. Michael, let's go!

419
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,924
Thank you. Thank you.

420
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,886
You gotta get him to a hospital
right away.

421
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,359
Wait, wait, wait.

422
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,697
Hey, man, forget Finley Road.

423
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,992
The plane's gonna stop
at the 7-mile marker...

424
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,369
...Route 4, at sunset.

425
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:32,041
It's gonna stop for five minutes,
then it's gonna go to Oaxaca, Mexico.

426
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,960
You miss it, you're out of luck.

427
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,307
- He bled out on the way over.
- Any lD?

428
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,561
Yeah, Roy Geary. Just an out-of-stater.

429
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,366
- You know him?
- He's a friend of mine.

430
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,952
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,248
Would you mind
answering a few more questions?

432
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,592
- Yeah.
<i>- It's Pam.</i>

433
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,261
What's going on?

434
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,932
I just wanted to say hey.

435
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,019
Well, are you all right?
You said it was important.

436
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,442
I know things
got kind of ugly toward the--

437
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,278
You know, the end.

438
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,864
I got ugly.

439
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:50,619
<i>But I want you to know</i>
<i>that there were circumstances that...</i>

440
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,456
It was better that you and Cameron...

441
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,458
That you were not with me.

442
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,461
Why are you telling me this now?

443
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,506
If I had to do it all over again...

444
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,217
...I'd do it different, you know?

445
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,430
We'd still be a family.

446
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,474
<i>I'd give anything for that.</i>

447
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,604
- I just wanted you to know.
<i>- Alex...</i>

448
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,649
- ...what's going on?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

449
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,569
I just wanted to call
to say that I was...

450
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:32,161
- That I'm sorry about everything.
- Where are you right now?

451
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,247
<i>- I can come get you.</i>
- Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

452
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,458
No, I'm serious. Where are you?

453
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,668
One more thing.

454
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,797
- If you hear anything in the media...
<i>- What?</i>

455
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,009
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

456
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,350
I love you.
Give Cam a kiss for me, okay?

457
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,399
Well, I'm glad I told you about this place.

458
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,568
I'm glad I figured out
how to work a GPS.

459
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,821
Make it a little more
difficult next time?

460
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,240
- I owe you one.
- No, we're even.

461
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,825
But we gotta leave.

462
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:58,288
- Linc.
- Hey, buddy.

463
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,499
- How you doing?
- Where's L.J.?

464
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,836
- He's safe. The money?
- I'll tell you later. We gotta go.

465
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,420
I brought someone.

466
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,340
Dad.

467
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,730
We've met before.

468
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,466
This is happening right now, okay?

469
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:55,512
Don't make me do this.

470
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,182
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

471
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,101
You wouldn't? Really?
Are you that stupid?

472
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,853
Are you that stupid?

473
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,105
Because now you're going to die!

474
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,648
You're going to die.

475
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,903
And all you had to do was tell me
what your father gave you.

476
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,363
I know my options.

477
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,201
I can not tell you and die
or I can tell you and still die.

478
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,827
No, wrong.

479
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:23,624
Sara, come on.
Smarten up for once in your life.

480
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,168
Please.

481
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,594
Go to hell.

482
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,810
You know what?
Drowning is horrific...

483
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,979
...don't get me wrong,
but once you give in...

484
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:50,234
...and just let the water come into your
lungs, there's a certain euphoria, I hear.

485
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,737
I guess as a junkie,
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

486
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:58,992
You did this to yourself.
