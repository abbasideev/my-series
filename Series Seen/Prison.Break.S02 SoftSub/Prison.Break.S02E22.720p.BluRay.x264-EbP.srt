1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,502
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,172
A very credible witness has just come
forward and he's willing to testify.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,133
He'll corroborate everything
you've said about this conspiracy.

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,718
Who?

5
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,390
How much do you know
about Sona, Mr. Kim?

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,352
Only what I've been given clearance on.
There's been a change in strategy.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,855
- How much further would I have to go?
- For this you only have to go to Panama.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,775
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- You e-mailed me, said T-Bag was here.

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,069
- It's on the website.
- I didn't write on no website.

10
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,656
- This is looking more like a setup.
- He's got Maricruz locked away.

11
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,158
Either I help him get the money
or she's dead.

12
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,119
Freeze, Bagwell!

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,582
Theodore Bagwell. He's the one
you want for that dead chick in there.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,459
Sucre, you better pull it together.

15
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,836
Oh, God!

16
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,172
Go get the money. Please.

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,925
Who you fooling?

18
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:54,095
You ain't gonna kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

19
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,596
You ain't got it in you.

20
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,935
- Linc?
- Hello, Michael.

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,854
What do you want, Alex?

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,856
Bring me the money. Bring me the boat.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,566
You are out of your mind.

24
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,526
We have something
the other person needs.

25
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,403
Your brother for your plan.

26
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,364
Five minutes. That's what you have.

27
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,876
I didn't kill that man.

28
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,962
I'm getting you out of here.

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,798
I got three Weeks.
MICHAEL.. Just have a little faith.

30
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,595
I did everything I could.

31
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,138
I know you did.

32
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,820
Señor.

33
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,699
- Chicle?
- No.

34
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,243
Soda? Beer, my friend.

35
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,080
Spleef? Magic mushrooms.

36
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,082
Burst your brain, split it wide open.

37
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm your man, man.

38
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,171
Magic Mystery Tour,
right here in this box.

39
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,174
If I don't got it, I can get it.

40
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,843
Beat it.

41
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,184
So you gonna do the right thing?

42
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,978
Right for who, Alex?

43
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,189
You've lost, Michael.

44
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,690
That's what you've done here.

45
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,861
You'll lose a whole lot more unless
you tell me right here and right now...

46
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,156
...you're gonna bring me the money,
you're gonna bring me the boat.

47
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,034
And you'll just let my brother go.

48
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,786
Yeah.

49
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:47,208
Just like you let Tweener go
and Abruzzi and Haywire.

50
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,293
Things are different now.

51
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,045
- Really?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:56,717
The people I was working for,
they kind of, uh, sold me down the river.

53
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,136
Now I just wanna go out to sea.

54
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,347
That's funny.
I'll have to remember that one.

55
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,058
I face more prison time than you.

56
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,562
Sort of jumped ahead of you a few
spots on the public enemy list.

57
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,065
You're my way to freedom, Michael,
and I'm yours.

58
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,234
We both know
what the other one's capable of.

59
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,404
Let's treat each other with respect here.
No games, no bluffing.

60
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,073
Just two guys
doing each other a favor.

61
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,242
What do you say?

62
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,204
Where are you?

63
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,249
Mira Flores shipping docks,
just outside of Panama City.

64
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,168
It's a big warehouse
right on the water.

65
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,920
That's a long ways.

66
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,089
It'll take me at least 24 hours
to get there.

67
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,217
Well, then, I'd get moving.

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,015
How's it feel being on the run?

69
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,101
- I'll survive.
- Not if they catch you.

70
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,103
They'll send you to the chair.

71
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,523
You think that's ironic?

72
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,567
It'd be justice.

73
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,277
Mr. Kim. Alex Mahone.

74
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,280
Call me.

75
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:03,117
Oh, justice will be served.

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,957
What I'm about to divulge to you
will in all likelihood get me killed.

77
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,461
- Actually, I guarantee it.
- Then why are you doing it?

78
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,633
Because this was supposed to be
about country, about loyalty...

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,218
...about what's right, but it wasn't.

80
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:26,140
Because I wronged people
who should not have been wronged.

81
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,315
Those orders were given
by Caroline Reynolds...

82
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,734
...who was vice president at the time.

83
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,821
Acting on those orders,
I planted evidence.

84
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:46,118
I procured a body, I lured Lincoln Burrows
into that parking garage that evening...

85
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,746
...under the auspices of a different hit.

86
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,669
From the ground up, we framed him.

87
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,423
Perfect.

88
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,010
See, Lincoln Burrows gets executed,
people forget about Terrence Steadman...

89
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,596
...the controversy surrounding him
and the presidency.

90
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,933
And nobody ever knows
about the Company.

91
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,311
Yes, which is a shadowy cabal
of corporations...

92
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,023
...that pretty much influence everything
that happens in this country.

93
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,694
But I fail to see how any of this
is relevant to Sara Tancredi...

94
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,780
...and the fact that she aided and
abetted, that she jumped bail.

95
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,659
She did so because she feared
for her life, which was appropriate...

96
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,786
...as I had orders to kill her.

97
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,228
Hey.

98
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,650
You still in the magic business?

99
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,405
- What's your name?
- Chaco.

100
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,491
It's all here.

101
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,120
Everything Mr. Kellerman said
is corroborated in these documents.

102
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,081
In light of this evidence,
my question, I guess to you...

103
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,751
...is whether your time
and resources are best spent...

104
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,336
...in pursuing charges
against Dr. Tancredi.

105
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:24,925
No. My office will drop all charges
effective immediately.

106
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,430
But, Your Honor, I would like
to devote my time and attention...

107
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,476
...in prosecuting this man,
Mr. Kellerman.

108
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,728
Officer.

109
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,278
I literally don't even know
what to say to you.

110
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,823
It was good knowing you, Sara.

111
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,917
- Yeah?
- Where are we?

112
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,627
I'm in Panama. Nice place.

113
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,421
Good weather. Cool breeze.

114
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,465
Where are we with the brothers?

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,469
When you get them, I wanna
come down there for confirmation.

116
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,054
I suggest you get on a plane.

117
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,388
By the time you get here...

118
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,058
...I'll have Scofield and Burrows
where you want them.

119
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,602
And then this whole thing is over.

120
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,991
Sara, it's me.

121
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,285
It's a strange thing...

122
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,498
...leaving a message for someone
you know is never gonna get it.

123
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,668
I can only assume the worst...

124
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:45,798
...so this'll be the last message
I'll leave for you.

125
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,511
I just wanted you to know
that I made it.

126
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,015
But it's no good without you.

127
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,105
Anyway, remember when I...?

128
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,191
Remember when I told you
about those 50-cent beers...

129
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,236
...in Baja at happy hour?

130
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,114
Well, they're even cheaper down here.

131
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,826
And if by some miracle
you do get this...

132
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,746
...I need you to listen close.

133
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,919
Sara. Sara, I suggest
we get you out of here.

134
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:28,382
It's gonna be a media circus outside
and it'll only get bigger. Let's go.

135
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,676
Sure.

136
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,307
Larger unexpected fireworks at the trial
of Dr. Sara Tancredi in Chicago today.

137
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,852
New testimony has implicated
that former President Reynolds...

138
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,523
...was complicit in the falsification of
her brother Terrence Steadman's death.

139
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,359
The fallout from all this,
the purported killer...

140
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,072
...Lincoln Burrows, who's led
the country on a nationwide manhunt...

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,659
...will be exonerated of all charges
effective immediately.

142
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,414
Oh, my God, Bruce.
Lincoln's a free man.

143
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,248
Michael left me a message.
Okay. My God. Um...

144
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,460
He doesn't know.
He's still planning on running.

145
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,462
Uh...

146
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,423
Come on, Michael. Come on,
come on, come on.

147
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,843
Let me do the intro.

148
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,221
Fine. Then I'll do the talking.

149
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,604
Okay, I gotta go to him.

150
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,481
- What's that, about 3000 miles?
- It is.

151
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,318
We're gonna have to swing by my hotel,
and you'll have to get me to the airport.

152
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,281
He's gotta know he doesn't have to run.
What he's doing is gonna get him killed.

153
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,454
The stars are finally aligning, sir.

154
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,624
Mahone's got Burrows.
Scofield's on his way.

155
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,422
I will make it happen.
I am going down there myself.

156
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,722
Uh, I assume we both know
which one that is.

157
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,520
I will call you when I get down there.

158
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,663
I just-- I want you to listen
really, really close, okay?

159
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,541
- Alex, Alex, slow down.
- Okay, okay, fine.

160
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,711
We talked about getting back together,
about giving it another shot.

161
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,630
Yes, and I said that maybe we could.

162
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,011
- Alex?
- What about Columbia?

163
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,889
- Cartegena?
- Go there?

164
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,224
Well, you got summer break
coming up, don't you?

165
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,727
- Same with Cam?
- Yeah. But--

166
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,896
Listen, I'm not far from there
right now...

167
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,691
...and I was thinking, why not just stick
around and have you guys come down?

168
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,985
I mean, you always wanted to go,
didn't you?

169
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,072
- Visit the homeland?
- Yes, but you didn't.

170
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,990
Yeah, but I do now.

171
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,494
Uh...

172
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,498
Yeah. I mean, I suppose I could,
we could maybe do two weeks...

173
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,124
...at the end of the summer, or--

174
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,668
- Is that a yes? That's a yes, right?
- Yes, yes.

175
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,421
Great coffee, great beaches,
wildlife parks for Cam and--

176
00:11:55,256 --> 00:12:00,761
Look, it might not work out.
You've gotta be prepared for that. I--

177
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,013
It can't be like it was before.

178
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,851
It will never be like before.

179
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,270
I know what's important now.
I know what matters.

180
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,232
Well, I guess I could look online.

181
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,442
I don't know. I should go.

182
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,944
Just come be with me, Pam.

183
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,613
Be with me.

184
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,133
Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?

185
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,717
It's you I'm marrying.

186
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,431
Señor Gonzales.

187
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,550
U.S. Embassy operator.

188
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,262
I'm looking for a friend.
A missing American friend.

189
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,141
He could be in the hospital.
He could be in jail.

190
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,018
Name?

191
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,898
Bellick. Brad Bellick.

192
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,861
Hey! Hey, do I get
to call my lawyer or what?!

193
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,405
What are you, savages down here?

194
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,700
I get to call my lawyer or something.

195
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,203
Freaking banana benders.

196
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,048
Finally! That's him!

197
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,052
That's the guy. He's the one
that killed that girl. Good job, guys.

198
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,350
Hey. Hey, aren't you gonna
release me now?

199
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,227
Hey.

200
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,603
Hey!

201
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,068
- You're busted.
- Am I?

202
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,323
- Where's the money?
- Pretty Boy's got it.

203
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,702
He's out there with a royal flush, and
you're in here with a busted straight.

204
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,581
- That hardly seems right, does it?
- Your hand don't look much better.

205
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,458
Maybe I got an ace up my sleeve.

206
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,086
You know something I don't?

207
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,924
You should rest your leg, boss.

208
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,662
I was told we could make a deal.

209
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,332
You're a long ways from home, boy.
There ain't no deal for you here.

210
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,751
You haven't heard
what I have to offer.

211
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,883
A guy looking like you do,
coming here?

212
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,012
Only thing you offering is jail time.

213
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,642
I'm not a cop.

214
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,320
Check online.
Type in Michael Scofield.

215
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,988
That means nothing to me.

216
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,781
Could mean a hundred grand.

217
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,966
This takes longer than 30 seconds,
you're in the canal.

218
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,054
Bait for the catfish.

219
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,681
Hey.

220
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,569
You just gave me a hundred thousand
reasons to turn you in.

221
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,029
That's true.

222
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,658
I guess I'll just have to give you
a few more not to.

223
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,625
You know I'm innocent.

224
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,086
- Yeah, probably.
- And yet you don't care.

225
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,381
I don't care about anything
other than getting my life back, no.

226
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,257
Your wife know who you really are?

227
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,593
Hey, you know how it is.

228
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,763
Good men doing bad things
because of circumstance.

229
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,559
I'd call her back if I were you.
Tell her to forget you were ever born.

230
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,269
Oh, you would, would you?

231
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,772
Stop the cancer
from your life spreading to theirs.

232
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,984
Cancer of my life?

233
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,446
I wouldn't be begging her to meet me
in this third-world dump...

234
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,365
...if it weren't for you and your life.

235
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,994
There's no way out of this for you.
For any of us.

236
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,753
For me, there is.

237
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:37,597
- How much of it you spend?
- A hundred thousand. Two.

238
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,766
Of course, down here,
be more like a million.

239
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,436
Be Louis XIV for a sum like that.

240
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,479
The Sun King of Panama.

241
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,149
You ain't gonna be seeing
much sun now.

242
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,610
Hmm. I don't know.

243
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:57,659
You know, Bagwell, out of all
the guys, all eight of them...

244
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,663
...you were the guy I was hoping
would go down in a blaze of gunfire.

245
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,416
Why don't you give me
your best shot? Finish the job.

246
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,334
Maybe I will.

247
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:14,342
That Siamese cat smile just makes me
wanna open you up that much more.

248
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,180
It's Cheshire. Cheshire cat smile.

249
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm free?

250
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,859
Hey.

251
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,861
Hey, what the hell is this?

252
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,198
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
What about him?

253
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,074
He's the one that did it.

254
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,498
What's that mean? Buena suerte?
What does that mean?

255
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,168
Good luck.

256
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,693
Bellick.

257
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,155
Bellick!

258
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,908
Where is my Maricruz?

259
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,827
Where is she?

260
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,546
You wanna know where she is,
find a way to get me out of this!

261
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,215
Get me out of here!

262
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,593
Sucre, get me out of this! Get me out!

263
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:58,280
Maricruz.

264
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,848
Michael, that's a beautiful boat.

265
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,351
Just promise you'll change the name
when you take it.

266
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,103
I don't think my mother
would have approved of you.

267
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,230
Consider it done. Come on.

268
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,441
- Uncuff me.
- No, not yet.

269
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,860
So is this the part
where you go back on your word?

270
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,696
Hands up, hands up.

271
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,034
No.

272
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,288
As of now, they want you alive.

273
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,873
Why?

274
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,335
That's a good question.

275
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,254
Figure it out some day, on your
own time. Where's the money?

276
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,382
- Cut him loose.
- No.

277
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,676
Come on, Alex.
You already got the boat.

278
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,011
- Show a little good faith.
- The money.

279
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,930
I want--

280
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,935
- Yeah?
- I'm here. Where are you?

281
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,062
I'm inside the warehouse.

282
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,524
I'll be right there.

283
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,281
Here we go.

284
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,994
- Hello?
- Hello.

285
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,080
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir. Can I help you?

286
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,000
- Yes, yes. Mira Flores docks.
- Everything all right?

287
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,752
- Yes. There's been a murder.
- Are you in danger?

288
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,672
A well-dressed Asian man
has just been shot by two Americans.

289
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,091
- We'll send a car right away.
- Come. Yes, come.

290
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,346
So you kill him and frame us.

291
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,891
Why?

292
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,688
So everyone will leave me alone.

293
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,609
Because that's all I want.
That, and the money.

294
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,238
- It's not gonna happen, Alex. Let him go.
- Give me the money.

295
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,365
- Let him go.
- Give me the money!

296
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,800
I am dumbfounded.

297
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,769
Well, don't be shy. They're all yours.

298
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,857
You said you'd have them right
where we wanted them.

299
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,359
This isn't right where we want them.

300
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,780
Well, that's your job now.

301
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,492
- Oh.
- This is as far as I go.

302
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,994
Or is it something else?

303
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,289
Another reason we're all here?

304
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,166
Like that.

305
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,296
- Like a double-cross.
- Yeah, just like that. Say goodbye.

306
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,010
Great minds think alike, eh, Alex?

307
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,664
Okay, come on, come on.

308
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,057
Once seated, your four-piece
will be mounted to the floor-mount.

309
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,518
During transport,
do not speak to either I, myself--

310
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,395
I know the drill.

311
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,400
Get in.

312
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,927
- So, what have we got, 30 minutes?
- Yeah, something like that.

313
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,638
- Why didn't you take the freeway?
- Rush hour.

314
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,309
- Oh, hell.
- What?

315
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,438
- The engine light just came on.
- It just got serviced at motor pool.

316
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,775
Yeah. We've gotta pull over
just to make sure.

317
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,750
All right, I'll check it out.

318
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,345
In the French Resistance, it was
a high honor to face a Nazi firing squad.

319
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,682
- Thought I told you to be quiet.
- Meant you did your job.

320
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,061
The highest honor was to smile
when they shot you.

321
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,607
Took you long enough.

322
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,705
Lake Gatun. Eastern canal.

323
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,833
Approaches to Cartegena.
Twenty-seven-fifty.

324
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,626
What's that crossing take?

325
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,713
Two days
if you're under full sail all the time.

326
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,716
Good time of year to be down here.
No storms. Nothing.

327
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,884
Had enough storms recently.

328
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,138
- Enjoy it. It's a beautiful crossing.
Ha-ha. I plan to.

329
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,849
This boat here. Who does it belong to?

330
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,851
Señor?

331
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,937
We got a call that this boat was used
in some illegal trafficking.

332
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,399
It's the wrong boat, pal.
You can check it if you want to, but--

333
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,736
- Hey, you can't just go to--
- Hey, this is Panama, friend.

334
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,030
Get acquainted with the law, huh?

335
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,993
- I--
Coca.

336
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,373
Yes, I definitely think you need
to get acquainted with it.

337
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,459
Chico.

338
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,464
Well, I...

339
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,849
- You think they got him?
- It's a pretty singular boat.

340
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,019
That's a lot of coke to be
carrying around. If you were at the helm--

341
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,313
I'd be doing some serious time.
Ten years, minimum.

342
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,107
Yeah, you would. We lost the boat.

343
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,193
At least we got dead man's money.

344
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,320
It's our ticket
to the rest of our lives...

345
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,906
...minus what I'm sending
Westmoreland's daughter.

346
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,991
Hey.

347
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,994
- You showed up.
- We had a deal.

348
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,455
- That's my brother.
- Hey.

349
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,499
This way.

350
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,669
So we get out of here
and we never look back.

351
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,464
We never look back.

352
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,348
I wanna thank you, Michael,
for everything.

353
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,518
You're welcome.

354
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,772
It's the best I could do
with the money you gave me.

355
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,983
That'll work.

356
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,034
- She's very pretty.
- She'll get us where we need to go?

357
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,370
Not the boat, señor.

358
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,729
So I got your message.

359
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,067
Thank God I found you guys.

360
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,738
Thank God is right.

361
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,032
Michael, Lincoln's free.

362
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,451
What?

363
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:51,664
Uh, it's all over the news.
Paul Kellerman came forward.

364
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,418
And he had everything documented
and he made a full confession.

365
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,129
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

366
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,924
- Everything?
- Everything. All charges.

367
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,678
Whoa.

368
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,974
What a...

369
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:15,062
Man, what a-- No more...

370
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,690
It means you don't
have to run anymore.

371
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,446
What about Michael?

372
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,616
Uh, a friend of my father's
is getting into it...

373
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,869
...but he's pretty confident
that under the circumstances...

374
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,288
...nobody's gonna pursue you on this.

375
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,795
I need a drink.

376
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,132
I'll go see what I can find.

377
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,527
Here.

378
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,987
Help me out of this.

379
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,412
We did it, Linc.

380
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,375
- We did it.
- Yeah.

381
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,918
No.

382
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,754
You almost did it.

383
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,892
You want the money?

384
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,187
Take the money. Take it.

385
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,774
You think this is about the money?

386
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,028
Pocket change? Like 5 million?

387
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,198
Then what is it about?
My brother's been exonerated.

388
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:53,369
The president stepped down.
We're not a threat anymore. It's over.

389
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,206
You may be done with us, but that
doesn't mean we're done with you.

390
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,711
- The police are on their way.
- This started with me.

391
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,631
- Let my brother go.
- Oh, that's sweet, that's sweet.

392
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,885
You don't hear that much anymore,
that sort of fidelity in families.

393
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,472
Two brothers who will go to the ends
of the earth for each other.

394
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,891
Too bad only one of you will survive.

395
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,477
No!

396
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,907
We gotta go.

397
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:53,155
My men have orders to fire if you
don't come out with your hands first.

398
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,124
Murder is not something that we take
lightly here on Panamanian soil.

399
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,876
So come on out of there
and there will be no more deaths.

400
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,504
Michael, I took a man's life.

401
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,424
Don't think about that now.

402
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,926
You and I have got a date, remember?

403
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,554
Two limes and a couple of beers.
Don't forget that.

404
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,098
This is your last warning.

405
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,766
Give me the gun.

406
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,020
I took a man's life.

407
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:31,777
We're gonna walk out of here together
and tell them exactly what happened.

408
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,699
No, look at me, look at me,
look at me.

409
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,618
Now, we're gonna tell them
what happened.

410
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,621
- Okay.
- We're gonna explain everything.

411
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,333
And I'm gonna do
whatever I can to help you.

412
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:50,087
- Okay?
- Yeah.

413
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,134
Now, give me the gun.

414
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,553
Here.

415
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,687
You ready?

416
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,194
I love you.

417
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,573
I love you too, Sara.

418
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,173
- Okay.
- You ready?

419
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,674
- Yeah.
- All right.

420
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,260
- Yeah.
- Come on.

421
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,100
Don't move!

422
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,936
I'll shoot!

423
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,605
- Michael, what are you doing?
- Nobody moves! Nobody!

424
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,819
- You sacrificed everything for me once.
- No.

425
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,030
- No! Don't move!
- No, I won't let you do this.

426
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,949
Michael. Michael!

427
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:04,203
Now it's time to say thank you.
It was me! It was me!

428
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,622
- I did it!
- He's done nothing wrong!

429
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,042
- He's innocent!
- I did it! It was me.

430
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,795
- I did it! It was me.
- He's done nothing wrong.

431
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,714
He hasn't shot anybody,
he hasn't hurt anybody. Michael.

432
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,716
Michael, tell them the truth!

433
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,512
Michael! He's done nothing wrong!

434
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,496
Hello?

435
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,999
Hey, it's me.

436
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:54,169
Oh, getting impatient. Reminds me
of when we were in college.

437
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,840
Did you buy the tickets yet?

438
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,926
No, I'm still looking.

439
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,344
Don't.

440
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:07,224
- What?
- Forget about them.

441
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,228
Forget I ever existed.

442
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,714
- Excuse me. You speak English?
- Yes. Can I help you?

443
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,216
Yeah. I'm looking for a woman.
Sara Tancredi.

444
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,761
She was brought in to give her
statement, then released.

445
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,429
You just missed her.

446
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,898
Sara!

447
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,684
Oh, God.

448
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,395
I thought you'd never show up.

449
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,693
Okay, when am I getting out of here?

450
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,738
That's the thing.
There's been a hiccup.

451
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,574
A hiccup?

452
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,660
Look, you guys got me.

453
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,663
You got me fair and square
in Mexico, all right?

454
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,375
I did what you wanted me to do. Now
it's time to cut me loose like we agreed.

455
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,544
Getting caught wasn't part
of the agreement.

456
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,587
I got caught running your setup.

457
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,215
Being your bait.

458
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,301
Now, I got you Scofield down here.
I got you what you wanted.

459
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,472
You got caught, Bagwell.

460
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,601
Wait. Where you going?!

461
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,437
Where you going?

462
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,983
I got you what you wanted!
I got them boys down here!

463
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,111
I did what you told me to do!

464
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,782
Do you hear me?
I did what you told me to do!

465
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,076
I did what you told me!

466
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,899
This is as far as we go.

467
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,551
General.

468
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,598
I trust this is a safe place to speak.

469
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,809
It's Scofield.

470
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,936
They got him.

471
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,727
Scofield back in the pen.

472
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:05,856
Gotta be honest,
I didn't think we'd see it happen.

473
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,359
You know he's gonna break out.

474
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,737
It's in his blood.

475
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,866
That's exactly what
we want him to do.
