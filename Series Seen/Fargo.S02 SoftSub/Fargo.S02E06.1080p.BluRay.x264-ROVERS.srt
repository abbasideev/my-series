1
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,210
- Ed. No.
- Peggy, come here.

2
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,327
This is... You're so
outta line, Sheriff!

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,367
Peggy, Peggy!

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,044
- You can't just ruin people's lives!
- Peggy, Peggy.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,201
You come back inside. No!

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,806
Parade them around Main Street
for something they didn't do!

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,609
Falsely accused. No.

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,806
Peggy.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,680
No! You're not gonna prove
my Ed did anything wrong.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,921
It's unprovable!

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,050
Heard about the fire.

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,043
- You okay?
- You didn't have to come down.

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,329
Mrs. Solverson. Ed.

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,686
I'm worried about you.

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,291
Feels like the top might just spin
right off the globe these days

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,600
and take you along with it.

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,610
What's that for?

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,763
I'm just imagining you parachuting
into the Mekong Delta,

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,446
telling the black pajamas
to leave your husband alone.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
Shoulda.

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,966
Coulda saved a lotta lives if wives
and mothers from both sides came

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,122
and dragged their fool
men home by the ear.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,643
Anything I can do
to help this mess?

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,849
Yeah, you can take
Noreen home with you.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,805
Her place burned
down with the shop

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,644
and we both know
she's just a kid,

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,131
emancipated or not.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,406
Noreen.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,371
Hey, Ed.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,487
I told 'em what you said.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
Quiet now. Both of you.

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,600
Come home soon.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,523
We both know that's not likely.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,126
Come on, dear.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,202
Let's get you
home and in a bath.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,442
I'll make us some cocoa.
All right?

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,045
She's a nice lady. Shut up.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,165
Time for your phone call.

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,126
Five minutes.

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,201
I was thinking about

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,281
Elron the other day.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,806
Before?

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,685
His face, you know,
trying to remember...

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,765
I was 10 when they came.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,606
Soldiers in uniform
with that folded-up flag.

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,483
You were in Chicago, I think.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,406
Mom says.

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,011
There's that picture in the hall,
with you and all the kids,

49
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,929
that winter in Bear Lake.

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,244
Everyone else in coats,

51
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,885
but Elron's in a T-shirt,
making muscles.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,448
And what would he
do now, you know?

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,801
Now, with this.

54
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,081
'Cause he was the oldest, right?

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Not Dodd.

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,046
What?

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,090
Uncle. Charlie's on the phone.

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,087
What?

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,966
I get it.

60
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,247
You don't have
respect for anything.

61
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,882
But do you know
what a whore's life is?

62
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,246
Come on now.

63
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,487
I'm serious. This is me
looking out for you.

64
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,844
Some career advice.

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,850
A whore's life is
five good years,

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,570
five bad years,

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,768
and then some
half-dick sweat stain

68
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,888
grinds you out like a cigarette.

69
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,561
Like a goddamn spent cigarette.

70
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,087
My son? You sent my goddamn son?

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,563
Jesus! Will you cut it out!

72
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,287
C'mon, Bear! Will somebody get him off me?

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,044
You better stop now.

74
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,327
Okay.

75
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,482
You've been asking for it for
days now, and now it's time.

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,722
Tell your man, "Walk
away," and we'll see.

77
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,444
You're getting the belt, kid.

78
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,851
Strap or buckle?

79
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,045
You think you're... Belt was
dad's thing, and you're not...

80
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,043
The kid said he was ready.

81
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,851
Said it should be family that
pulls the trigger, which is true.

82
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,731
He's 17.

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,891
He's got a crippled arm.

84
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,530
Now see, I don't see that.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,570
I see heart and will.
I see spirit.

86
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,723
I see Grandpa
after the war. Right, Pop?

87
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,167
Grandpa, who stows away
on a boat,

88
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,322
comes to America
and builds an empire.

89
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,691
Compared to that, what
have you ever done?

90
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,091
Or me?

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,491
Arm or no arm?

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,169
Now, you can have
the strap or the buckle.

93
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,163
'Cause I can't have you
knocking me around,

94
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,446
not in front of the men.

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,371
Give me the buckle,
you piece of shit.

96
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,805
That's my boy.

97
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,489
No!

98
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,005
No!

99
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,448
None of your bullshit!
Not today.

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,091
You'll kill us all, you
split this family apart!

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,045
Now tell me what happened.

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,208
Bring back my grandson.

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,123
No excuses.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,567
I'll call up to Winnipeg,
tell 'em he's coming.

105
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,324
He can stay there
till things cool down.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,844
And you, while he's
seeing to the boy,

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,082
you take care of this butcher.

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,491
He doesn't live
through the night.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,881
Already dead, believe me.
He just doesn't know it.

110
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,130
This better be
state-secret-level information.

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,281
They all left.

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,447
Who all?

113
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,966
Dodd and Bear,
and maybe half a dozen...

114
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,121
Going?

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,725
He called me a whore.

116
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,804
Well, darling, technically...

117
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,245
It's my body.

118
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,651
I got every right to...

119
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,926
Of course you do.

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,447
We're in full agreement, you and me.

121
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,971
A beautiful body and you can
do what you want with it.

122
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,649
But right now
I need you to tell me,

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,371
your dad and the others,
where are they headed?

124
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
They're going to
that town in Minnesota.

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,968
Where the judge... Luverne.

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,611
Yeah, Luverne.

127
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,609
And I want you to...
You're gonna...

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,082
Get the hell outta here.

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,323
Did I lose
you there, sweetheart?

130
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,768
You're gonna kill him for me.

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,524
Your dad? He's not...

132
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,409
Ozzie was a dad.

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,211
On the TV, shit, Mr.
French is more of a...

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,611
How long ago did they leave?

135
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,288
Just... Maybe half an hour ago.

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,010
Took a whole army, almost.

137
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,320
Okay, baby.

138
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,171
Any last message for
your dad when I see him?

139
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,001
Yeah.

140
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,687
Tell him, "Kiss my grits."

141
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,647
"'Twas brillig,
and the slithy toves

142
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,688

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,085

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,129

148
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,771

"He went galumphing back"

155
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,448
I got coffee from this morning.
I could heat it up.

156
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,606
Please.

157
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,770
I'm gonna move these, okay?

158
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,606
No! Actually, no, those are my.
. . No, no, put them down!

159
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,681
No problem.

160
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,205
I just got that organized.

161
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,841
So, you collect these then?

162
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,729
The beauty and travel mags?

163
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,531
No. Not collect.

164
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,002
I gotta stay up with the latest
trends, you know, in my line of work.

165
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,291
Well, that explains
the beauty mags.

166
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,647
Well, there's more to life
than Minnesota, you know.

167
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,046
Do you think, uh...

168
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,531
I know there's
a lot of questions,

169
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,087
but I got this seminar tomorrow.

170
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,491
Lifespring?

171
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,086
And I gotta drive up to Sioux
Falls first thing. So...

172
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,882
Um...

173
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,282
Well, now, I got five
dead since Saturday,

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,250
including the one tonight in
the burned-down butcher shop.

175
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,210
And your husband is
currently in jail,

176
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,568
so, I wouldn't count on
getting there early.

177
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,964
No, I mean, that's terrible,
but what can Ed... I mean...

178
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,244
Attempted robbery and those
two men at the shop...

179
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,527
It wasn't a robbery, Peggy.

180
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,683
Those men came for your husband.
They came to kill him.

181
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,762
You don't know that
for sure, Sheriff.

182
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,490
You're just trying to be dramatic.
Trying to scare me.

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,204
I assure you, I am not.

184
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,441
And when I say five dead,

185
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,086
I'm only talking about
inside the city limits.

186
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,768
Reports are 15 more bodies,
15 more bodies, up in Fargo.

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,561
This is a turf war between
the Kansas City mob

188
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,450
and this Gerhardt family you've
gotten yourself mixed up with.

189
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,965
Stop saying that!

190
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,805
Me and Ed,
we're just bystanders.

191
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,611
Not even. Disconnected.

192
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,527
Him with the shop, and me, just
trying to actualize fully, you know?

193
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,284
Be the best me I can be,

194
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,124
because these are
modern times, you know?

195
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,884
And a woman, well, she
just doesn't have to be

196
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,291
a wife and a mother no more.

197
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,091
She can be... There's
nothing she can't be.

198
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,371
You're a little touched,
aren't you?

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,887
What?

200
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,200
It's not that there's
anything wrong with that.

201
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,930
Don't get me wrong.

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,606
It's just the time and place
in which you're...

203
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,729
Well, you know, if you mean
I got dreams, then, yeah.

204
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,203
And maybe I don't see it all like
everybody else, but I got plans.

205
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,921
We got plans and you can't just
come in here and derail...

206
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,485
Yeah, Peggy.

207
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,642
They tried to kill your husband.

208
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,324
I mean, they burned
down his shop.

209
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,243
You think that's the end of it?

210
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,169
Well, I mean, look, right?

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,961
Ed, he really...
He loved that place.

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,289
But life's a journey, you know?

213
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,089
That's what
John Hanley Sr. says.

214
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,527
He's the founder of Lifespring.

215
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,729
Life's a journey, and the one
thing you don't do on a journey

216
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,848
is stay in one place, right?

217
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,965
So, maybe we'll, I don't
know, go to California or...

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,485
California... someplace.

219
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,005
Now that the shop's gone...

220
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,202
Peggy,

221
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,330
before you, uh, before you start
making plans, you should know

222
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,562
I got a forensic
team coming down

223
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,722
from the Twin Cities
in the morning.

224
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,121
And I know it's been repaired,

225
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,204
but we're gonna check
your car for blood.

226
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,362
Microscopically, I mean.

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,728
Which you'd be amazed
at what we can find

228
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,404
on the atomic level these days.

229
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,883
No. I mean, you can't
do that, of course,

230
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,088
without permission
from the owner.

231
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,323
You know? So... Oh, we got
permission about an hour ago.

232
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,880
You sold the car to Sonny
Greer, didn't you?

233
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,201
Earlier? At the body shop?

234
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,250
And Sonny now is
the owner on record.

235
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,924
And he was more than happy to.
. . No.

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,162
No, you can't. That's...

237
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,527
Hold on... Peggy. Peggy.

238
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,204
I'm serious now.

239
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,045
Better you tell me before I
get a fistful of evidence.

240
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,364
What happened that night when you
hit Rye Gerhardt with your car?

241
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,086
I'm the victim here.

242
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,965
Lou... Ed.

243
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,610
I mean, 'cause...

244
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,241
I sat in your living room last
night and gave you the chance,

245
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,522
you and Peggy both,
I gave you the chance to...

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,047
I know, but you
gotta understand.

247
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,327
We're just trying to... No, me.

248
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,528
I'm just trying to
protect my family.

249
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,921
There was a cleaver
in the man's head, son,

250
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,769
which Noreen said was you.

251
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,365
Not to mention
there's a war going on

252
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,885
up in Fargo that
you may have started

253
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,008
when you ran over that
Gerhardt boy in Peggy's car!

254
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,845
You or Peggy, or both!

255
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,530
This is all just so crazy.

256
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,124
And I can't stop thinking about
that book, Noreen's book.

257
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,282
It's, like, stuck in my head.
What?

258
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,691
What book?

259
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,604
It's about this
guy who, every day,

260
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,207
he pushes this
rock up this hill.

261
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,890
Like a boulder.

262
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,683
And then every night,
it just rolls back down.

263
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,564
But he doesn't stop, you know?
He just... He keeps going.

264
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,089
And he wakes up every day
and he starts pushing.

265
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,484
By which, I guess I'm saying,

266
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,164
it doesn't matter
what they throw at me,

267
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,641
I'm gonna take care
of what's mine. And...

268
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,724
These boys aren't gonna rest
until you're dead, son.

269
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,604
Possibly Peggy, too.

270
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,250
I want a lawyer.

271
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,244
Lou, I need one.
I'm asking you for one.

272
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,601
Ed, that's not... No,
I've seen the shows on TV.

273
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,761
No, you don't...

274
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,571
I've seen the shows on TV.
Ironside and...

275
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,364
This is all too important
to make mistakes here.

276
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,048
So, get me a lawyer, a good one,

277
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,125
and if he says, then I'll talk.

278
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,287
No, Sonny, they just called
themselves plumbers,

279
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,126
but what it was was a
special investigative unit

280
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,611
inside the White House...

281
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,841
Hey, Karl.

282
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,287
Percy. Got a customer for you.

283
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,603
A client, I guess you...
Over at the station.

284
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,808
Ed Blumquist?
Butcher's assistant?

285
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,089
I guess he's mixed up
in all the craziness.

286
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,401
You hear that, Sonny?

287
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,804
There's a crisis at the highest
level, so who do they call?

288
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,490
The best lawyer in town.

289
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,608
Aren't you the only
lawyer in town, Karl?

290
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,651
Yes, but that's because I scared
away all my...

291
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,489
Great Caesar's ghost.

292
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,605
It would appear I'm
a little unstable...

293
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,920
You okay there, Karl?

294
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,684
Want me to tell Lou
you need a few hours?

295
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,331
Fermez ton bouche, son.

296
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,607
I am sound in mind and body,

297
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,923
and ready to run circles
around the inferior minds

298
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,128
of the Rock County
Sheriff's Department.

299
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,043
Lou is a state cop, Karl.

300
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,406
Shut up, Sonny.

301
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,567
I will need you
to drive, however.

302
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,163
My question for you is,

303
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,925
how come after
you hit that fella

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,004
you didn't just
drive to the hospital?

305
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,963
Or wave down a passing motorist

306
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,042
and ask him to call the cops?

307
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,726
You say it like these
things happen in a vacuum.

308
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,481
Like it's a test. Check A or B.

309
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,086
But it's like decisions you
make in a dream, you know?

310
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,245
I'll tell you what, if it
was me and we had to run,

311
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,001
I wouldn't look back.

312
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,489
- For what? The dazzle?
- This house?

313
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,449
This is Ed's house.

314
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,447
He grew up here,
his mom washing his undies.

315
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,363
His father taking his paper
to the commode.

316
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,727
You ask me how come
I buy all these magazines?

317
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,047
I'm living in
a museum of the past.

318
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,201
Okay.

319
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,806
You stay here.

320
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,201
Sheriff? Go inside now, Peggy.

321
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,806
If you got a hiding place in the
basement or the attic, go to that.

322
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,769
What about you? Go, now.

323
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,927
And don't come out,
no matter what you hear.

324
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,766
Hi.

325
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,001
Hello.

326
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,327
Help you fellas with something?

327
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,561
Hope so.

328
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,370
Ed home?

329
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,601
Ed who?

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,001
Oh.

331
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,969
Ed. Yeah.

332
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,886
Yeah.

333
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,444
Yeah, you just missed him.

334
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,928
A whole squad took him to the
station about an hour ago.

335
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,526
And that's the well-guarded

336
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,888
and impenetrable police
station on Hazel Lane

337
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,964
which, don't let the name
fool you, is a fortress.

338
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,044
Or maybe he's inside
and you think I'm stupid.

339
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,361
Son,

340
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,286
I could fill a steamer trunk with the
amount of stupid I think you are.

341
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,124
But, no, that's where he went.

342
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,169
Yeah, that's what I thought.

343
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,165
Here we go.

344
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,445
No, Peggy, hey, hey...

345
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,001
Said the butcher's
down at the precinct.

346
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,845
Could be bullshit,
take Polk and Carter.

347
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,410
I'll clean up here.

348
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,810
All clear upstairs!

349
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,404
Here, kitty, kitty.

350
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,049
Come on, kitty.

351
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,246
Kitty.

352
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,925
Here, kitty, kitty.

353
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,241
Shut up.

354
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,570
Shut up, you fool.

355
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,361
Shit.

356
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,201
When I find you, darling,
I'm gonna make you bleed.

357
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,166
Bitch!

358
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,761
Hon.

359
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,089
Yeah? Don't leave.

360
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,371
Wanna talk to you
about something.

361
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,241
Are you with us?

362
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,601
When you say "us..."

363
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,206
I mean the family. All of it.

364
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,090
You don't get to
pick and choose.

365
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,365
Sure, Grandma.

366
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,050
We all got a role to play.

367
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,570
You need to take my example.

368
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,526
Be a leader.

369
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,125
This is our time.

370
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,250
No such thing as men's work,
women's work anymore.

371
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,163
We got just as much right to...

372
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,290
Keep it running, Sonny.

373
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,011
I'll be back before
the beer goes warm.

374
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,722
Greetings and salutations.

375
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,370
I have made the pilgrimage
from the Hall of Veterans,

376
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,603
as George Washington
once forded the Delaware,

377
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,490
steely in my resolve,
prepared to battle

378
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,528
unto my dying breath
for the rights...

379
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,523
Lawyer's here. Hey, Denise.

380
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,204
For the rights of free men!

381
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,964
Hey, Karl, Ed's in back.

382
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,122
Rights that were squeezed
from British oppression

383
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,202
like water from a stone!

384
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,964
That all men are created equal,

385
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,647
free from the jackboot tyranny
and gulag magic tricks

386
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,324
of nameless,
faceless committees.

387
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,407
Hey, hope they didn't wake you.

388
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,050
Out of my way,
tool of the state.

389
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,408
For I have come to comfort
and counsel my client

390
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,164
even as you seek to prison him!

391
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,651
Yeah, whatever you're gonna
do, you got 30 minutes.

392
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,882
Don't dictate terms
to me, you rogue.

393
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,884
For the law is
a light on a hill,

394
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,324
calling to its breast all
those in search of justice.

395
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,131
To wit, this poor, mottled
wretch in front of me.

396
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,361
Hey, Karl.

397
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,321
Edward.

398
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,651
What a sad and fortuitous day.

399
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,326
You chained to
that table and me...

400
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,765
No, I'm not in cuffs.

401
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,569
Chained in thought
if not action.

402
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,688
At the mercy of
a cold and venal...

403
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,921
I didn't do this thing...

404
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,004
No, no, don't tell me.

405
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,765
The establishment has ears
everywhere, even here.

406
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,921
Ears?

407
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,721
Instead I shall
simply ask, "G or NG,"

408
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,724
and you, my client,

409
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,963
will shake your head
in the affirmative

410
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,682
for the letter or letters that
best describes your status.

411
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,525
So, I shake my head "yes"?

412
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,685
Let's say, for the purposes of the
cameras that are no doubt watching,

413
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,250
that a negative shake,
side to side,

414
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,529
shall in this case be
a positive affirmation.

415
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,162
Remember, only shake once.

416
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,721
G?

417
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,882
Or NG?

418
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,922
Well, son, rest assured,

419
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,566
whatever your status, I shall
defend you till your last breath.

420
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,165
I mean, my last breath.

421
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,051
Excuse the obvious
death penalty snafu.

422
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,610
I'm slightly inebriated.

423
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,005
Still got 26 minutes.

424
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,242
And that, by no
strange coincidence,

425
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,924
is the amount of
time it'll take me

426
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,525
to rouse Judge
Peabody from his bed

427
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,080
and have him dismiss
these unfounded charges.

428
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,286
No charges as of yet.

429
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,687
Held without charges!
Even better.

430
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,843
Then I shall have to tell His Honor
to boost my client from these

431
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,725
baseless restraints you've
shackled him under! Whoa!

432
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,006
Hey, you're not driving,
are you?

433
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,521
My choices outside this
building are none of your...

434
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,968
But, no, Sonny valeted
me here tonight.

435
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,201
But now,

436
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,362
now I must bid you all adieu

437
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,205
and admonish you to watch
your proverbial butts,

438
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,965
for I shall be back with the
sledgehammer of justice,

439
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,487
prepared to lay Joseph waste
to these four walls,

440
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,643
if you so much as
touch a hair on my client's...

441
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,526
Karl?

442
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,289
The jackboots are upon us.

443
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,281
Deputy Bluth, I need you
to lock the back door.

444
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,646
Do it now.

445
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,961
Garfield, kill the
lights in back.

446
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,804
Denise, get on the horn to HQ.

447
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,406
Tell 'em we need every man
available yesterday.

448
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,329
There's a lynching
party outside.

449
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,080
Shouldn't call
the sheriff first?

450
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,050
Well, you can try, but somehow
I don't think he'll answer.

451
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,770
If he does, tell him not
to do anything heroic

452
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,444
until reinforcements arrive.

453
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,531
You okay there, counselor?

454
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,921
It's possible I soiled myself.

455
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,811
Here for my boy.

456
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,810
Doesn't have to get any
more complicated than that.

457
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,804
Met you before. At the compound.

458
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,291
So you know.

459
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,647
Already called for
backup on the radio.

460
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,366
Nobody's coming.

461
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,090
No, they'll come.

462
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,131
State police up in Marshall or sheriff
out of Nobles, 30, 40 minutes.

463
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,202
Maybe we got a trap set.

464
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,560
That's possible.

465
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,010
Just gonna keep coming, though.

466
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,409
After Wounded Knee?

467
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,767
Hell, the governor may send
in the National Guard.

468
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,770
Now, we got your son
on attempted murder.

469
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,242
Took a shot at the local butcher.
The place burned down.

470
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,605
Where's that butcher now?

471
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,206
No.

472
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,408
I know you got designs on him.

473
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,005
He inside?

474
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,451
He's safe, guarded by armed men.

475
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,289
No.

476
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,646
No, he's not.

477
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,010
This kinda thing
didn't work in Westerns

478
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,525
and it's not gonna work tonight.

479
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,331
We got enough men and guns
to hold you off till morning.

480
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,971
Maybe I got a trunk
full of dynamite,

481
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,770
blow my way in.

482
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,290
Either way, you got less than five
minutes to send my Charlie out.

483
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,361
Who's this Charlie now?

484
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,169
Karl, I'm serious, I need
you to sit over there

485
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,651
and stay out of the way.

486
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,087
Deputy, how we doing securing
the back of the building?

487
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,401
Well, I mean, I locked the door.

488
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,323
Well, let's barricade
that, yeah?

489
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,323
Shades down on all the windows.

490
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,890
We got any light bulbs?

491
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,166
Light bulbs?

492
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,890
I want you to take
all the light bulbs we got,

493
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,327
smash 'em up by the
back doors and windows.

494
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,209
That way we can hear 'em
if they try to sneak in.

495
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,930
Oh. That's good thinking.

496
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,003
Need your help here.

497
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,082
I thought you had backup coming.

498
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,686
Closest men are outside
Nobles, an hour away.

499
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,771
Plus, you're talking
about farm boys

500
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,525
who've never been face-to-face
with a serious man before.

501
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,126
Whereas I stared
down Chiang Kai-shek.

502
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,362
That, and I need someone who can
talk some sense into the father.

503
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,890
Who better than
his son's lawyer?

504
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,011
Don't represent the son, though.

505
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,451
You do now, Karl.

506
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,601
Lou?

507
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,127
I'm walking you out of here.

508
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,645
Am I released then?

509
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,643
Well, let's call it
that for simplicity.

510
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,166
Truth is, there's a
lynch mob outside

511
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,730
wanting to string you up.

512
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,926
What are you...

513
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,047
Come on.

514
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,963
Stay close and be ready to run.

515
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,845
Sheriff, come in.

516
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,121
Sheriff?

517
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,282
Come in. Sheriff?

518
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,521
Sheriff?

519
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,083
Sheriff, there's a calamity up here.
If you're there, pick up.

520
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,682
Yeah, Denise. I'm here.

521
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,161
Oh, Sheriff, thank God! There's
an army of men outside.

522
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,811
They want Ed Blumquist
and that kid from the fire.

523
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,405
Lou's got this plan to...

524
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,009
Told me to tell you not to
come till reinforcements arrive,

525
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,287
which, sheriff's
deputies are on their way

526
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,528
from Nobles,
so maybe 45 minutes, sir.

527
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,884
Yeah, okay. Uh...

528
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,887
Tell Lou to sit tight.

529
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,048
Can't have him getting
killed without me.

530
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,324
Never hear the end
of it at dinner.

531
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,762
Maybe they forgot we're here.

532
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,566
Yeah.

533
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,760
Gear up. We're going in.

534
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,246
Hold on now. We're allies.

535
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,130
Like Ho Chi Minh
and the Red Chinese.

536
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,565
Arms in the air.

537
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,850
Karl Weathers.

538
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,205
That's my name.

539
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,444
I'm your son's attorney.

540
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,965
Don't need a lawyer.

541
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,690
He's going home tonight.

542
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,483
Send him out. I'm done playing.

543
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,210
Yes, sir.

544
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,123
That's in the works as we...

545
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,681
You mind if I...

546
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,490
As your son's man,

547
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,523
I spoke with the constabulary
at the highest level,

548
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,086
and they're prepared to
meet your demands.

549
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,084
Send the boy out.

550
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,563
Processing him now.

551
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,846
But as his lawyer...

552
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,400
Don't need no lawyer,
I told you.

553
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,690
As his lawyer, I gotta advise you
of something, which is this.

554
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,524
You're making it worse.

555
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,521
He's a minor, see? Only 17.

556
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,807
So, reduced sentencing applies.

557
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,361
Shh.

558
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,681
And, yes, witness
puts a gun in his hand

559
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,922
with a shot fired,
but it's a miss.

560
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,970
You understand?

561
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,641
A miss, so even if they convict
him, it's attempted at best.

562
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,770
The maximum is 10 years, he's
out in five for good behavior.

563
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,046
Done.

564
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,801
But this,

565
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,330
you take him outta here now and
he's running the rest of his life.

566
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,767
A wanted fugitive,
shoot on sight.

567
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,645
But there's a way out.

568
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,048
Leave now,

569
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,407
take your men, and none
of this falls on the kid.

570
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,482
This is the deal I made.

571
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,050
He stays clean.

572
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,490
But you gotta go. Now.

573
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,601
Maybe we leave Charlie,
just take the butcher.

574
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,167
Well, now, that's a problem.

575
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,611
See, any movement there
and they loop the kid in,

576
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,966
make him an accomplice.

577
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,691
Kidnapping, conspiracy
to commit murder,

578
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,331
assaulting a police officer,
or worse.

579
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,603
So, we're back to
the best thing for the kid

580
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,843
being a fast
retreat on your part.

581
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
That's the clearest path
of victory for you.

582
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,611
Think about it.

583
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,009
He's only 17.

584
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,046
Let's go.

585
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,288
I need to find Peggy.

586
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,881
Can't do that, Ed.
Not right now.

587
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,485
You're still in my custody.

588
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,040
Yeah, but what if
they came to the house?

589
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,283
I mean, they went
to the station,

590
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,522
what if they came to the.
. . Shh.

591
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,721
Come on.

592
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,400
Christ, man.
You look worse than me.

593
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,164
Smell better maybe.

594
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,124
No, don't tire yourself.

595
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,565
We know where he's headed.

596
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,164
Maybe you drive.

597
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,610
I'm seeing double.

598
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,411
I am a man of constant sorrow

599
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,720
I've seen trouble all my days

600
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,605
I'm talking about
the camaraderie of men, kid.

601
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,206
That hard-to-define male bond,
born in the age of the Neanderthal

602
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,124
when men still hunted mastodon
with flint and spears.

603
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,243
The place where he
was born and raised

604
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,887
For six long years, oh,
I've been in trouble

605
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,248
I'm saying you find that in
wartime, that foxhole brotherhood.

606
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,129
Then when you come back,

607
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,283
well, there's no civilian
equivalent, not in peacetime.

608
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,967
...to help me now

609
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,929
He has no friends
to help him now

610
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,401
So it's fare thee well to you,
my old true lover

611
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,241
I never expect to see you again

612
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,085
You sure know
a lot of words, Karl.

613
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,810
I'm an esquire, kid.

614
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,365
A barrister.

615
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,123
Defender of the common man,
the misaccused.
