1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,362
This is a true story.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,322
The events depicted
took place in Minnesota,

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,802
North and South Dakota in 1979.

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,569
At the request of the survivors,

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,926
the names have been changed.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,241
Out of respect for the dead...

7
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,643
The rest has been told
exactly as it occurred.

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,282
Feeling better then?

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,206
Mmm.

10
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,609
Doc says you had a reaction
to those pills they gave you.

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,962
I told him they were
supposed to kill the cancer,

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,045
but he says the pills
may kill you first.

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,286
Hmm?

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,168
Is Lou back?

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,244
No, and no word either.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,411
Something to eat?

17
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,891
Oh, God, no.

18
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,686
My dad?

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,565
Same. No word.

20
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,245
And Molly?

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,449
Tried to put her in her own
bed, but she wouldn't go.

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,204
Stubborn. Yeah.

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,927
She gets that from her dad.

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,244
If you're not gonna eat,
Doc says sleep.

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,489
Get your strength back.

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,921
Hmm.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,402
So, you stay lying down, you.

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,088
And it's okay,
I'll be right here.

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,489
That night, I had a dream.

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,044
Next week, we'll discuss
economic concepts...

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,441
it felt so real,

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,406
even though I knew
it couldn't be,

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,762
or wasn't yet.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,805
Yes, Molly.

35
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,486
I dreamt of a magical future,
filled with wondrous devices.

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,890
Where everything
you could ever want

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,770
would be available
in one amazing place.

38
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,005
All right.

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,050
Hey. Mmm-hmm. Daddy.

40
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,211
Just one more. BETSY: And
there was happiness there.

41
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,403
But then I saw farther still.

42
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,529
Years, decades into the future.

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,200
I saw a handsome older man,
his back still straight.

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,889
Visited by his children
and grandchildren.

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,411
People of accomplishment,
of contentment.

46
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,965
But then,

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,644
I saw chaos.

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,088
The fracture of peace
and enlightenment.

49
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,082
And I worried,
that the future I had seen,

50
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,169
magical and filled with light...

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,842
Yeah.
...might never come to pass.

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,808
Go.

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,687
I can make it.

54
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,727
Dinner Sunday?

55
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,446
I'll be there.
In a suit of armor.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,721
Hey!

57
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,286
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, mister!

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,201
What's the trouble, young fella?

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,245
Mister, we need a ride.

60
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,726
Come on.

61
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,884
People of Earth.

62
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,125
I'm home.

63
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,529
Come on, Ed.

64
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,365
Come on. Come on.

65
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,010
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

66
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,208
Just a little further. Look.

67
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,206
Come on.

68
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,050
Get outta here.

69
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,167
Sweet Christmas.

70
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,449
Get outta here! Go on, get outta here!
There's a bad man coming!

71
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,971
Okay, I'm gonna use the phone.
I'm gonna call...

72
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,366
Hon, come on. Let's go, come on.

73
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,690
Come on.

74
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,529
Oh! Don't! Don't!

75
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,367
You were supposed to watch
them, Ed and Peggy.

76
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,641
Come on.

77
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,280
Yeah. Okay.

78
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,600
I don't know, Ed.

79
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,051
It's okay.

80
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,484
We can lock it from the inside.

81
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,848
Hide out till they're...
Till we're rescued.

82
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,525
World War III out there
in case you didn't notice.

83
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,841
You okay there? Don't start.

84
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,807
She blindsided me, okay?
A pack of wolves at the door.

85
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,644
I didn't think the bitch...

86
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,041
Didn't think she'd be
dumb enough to sucker me.

87
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,607
Only one way he could
have gone, Hanzee. Huh?

88
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,729
And your feeling is we go the
same way, instead of home to bed.

89
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,246
Yeah. In a hurry.

90
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,644
FUBAR, yeah? FUBAR.

91
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,284
We got to lock it.

92
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,561
Here.

93
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,282
Come on, come on.

94
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,686
Here.

95
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,847
Sit down. You can do it.
Come on. You sit here.

96
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,251
Come here.

97
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,644
Sorry. I gotta...

98
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,290
It's bad.

99
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,325
Hold on. Let me just see
how bad it is.

100
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,727
Okay.

101
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,964
You're gonna be okay.

102
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,651
Peggy, I don't think
we're gonna make it.

103
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,761
Don't you say that,
Ed Blumquist.

104
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,842
We've come this far.
We're gonna go all the way.

105
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,844
No, I'm saying even
if we get out of this,

106
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,208
I don't think we're gonna
make it, you and me.

107
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,520
What are you saying?
We're just too different.

108
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,443
Don't say that.
This, what we been through...

109
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,206
Adversity, that's what
seals the bond.

110
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,930
Makes us stronger.

111
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,082
Like how a bone heals. Peg...

112
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,681
Peg...

113
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,845
No. No, I know I had my doubts.
I know, but I'm sure now.

114
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,043
Peg. Will you just let me talk?
I'm sure.

115
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,244
You're always trying
to fix everything,

116
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,369
but sometimes nothing's broken.

117
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,647
Everything's working just fine.

118
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,650
If you can't see that,
if you don't know that...

119
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,801
Ed.

120
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,245
I love you.

121
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,807
I do.

122
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,402
All I'm ever gonna want
is to get back to what we had.

123
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,521
Hello.

124
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,962
Gale, be reasonable.

125
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,004
From this moment forward,

126
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,288
I decree, no more
schnitzel or strudel.

127
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,811
Let's get some
American food up in...

128
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,568
Everyone's dead.

129
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,730
Forget something?

130
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,445
Well, you caught me.

131
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,684
I thought nobody was home.

132
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,600
We're here.

133
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,523
Remind me which one
you are again?

134
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,724
The kid Otto had with the maid?

135
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,968
You see the shotgun, right?

136
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,764
What, you couldn't
afford a real one?

137
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,922
Times are tough, friend-o.

138
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,484
Hey, why do you think
I'm stealing the silver?

139
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,286
Hey, maybe

140
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,281
in the spirit of human struggle,

141
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,770
we say bygones.

142
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,329
You let me get back in my car
and drive away.

143
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,330
Do you know what the definition
of the word "sovereignty" is?

144
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,005
What am I,

145
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,971
Professor from Gilligan's island?

146
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,608
Sovereignty is absolute
power and authority.

147
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,800
Like a king? Exactly.

148
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,324
Which is who I am.

149
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,250
Your king.

150
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,125
Uh...

151
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,323
It's America, brother.

152
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,764
We don't do kings.

153
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,850
Oh, we do.

154
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,170
We do.

155
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
We just call them
something else.

156
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,326
See, today is my coronation day.

157
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,364
And on coronation day,
I've always believed,

158
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,922
a new king should start his
reign with an act of kindness.

159
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,086
Right on.

160
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,965
And an act of cruelty.

161
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,408
That way, your subjects know
that you're capable of both.

162
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,366
God and monster.

163
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,881
Shit.

164
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,722
Sign me up for the first one.

165
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,804
Problem is,
Wilma works in the kitchen.

166
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,370
Oh, the Injun?

167
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,041
Right.

168
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,851
She has already
received my kindness,

169
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,604
to wit, a brand new car,

170
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,763
and all the money that was in
that cabinet you were searching.

171
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,291
Damn.

172
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,608
Which means you...
Don't tell me.

173
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,730
...are shit out of luck.

174
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,965
Story of my life, brother.

175
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,209
Hey, you ever been to Baltimore?

176
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,170
An act of cruelty, remember?

177
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,210
Well, I'm bushed, think
I'm gonna go take a nap.

178
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,567
You should get some rest, too.

179
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,043
For in the morning, we journey home
to bathe in that warm champagne

180
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,441
that is corporate praise.

181
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,245
Who knows?

182
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,367
Maybe they'll even
throw us a parade.

183
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,730
I love a parade.

184
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,802
Ed, save your strength, huh?

185
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,167
You're gonna be fine and
we'll figure this all out.

186
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,006
And I know I've been
nothing but trouble to you.

187
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,241
I know.

188
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,522
Maybe he just walks away.

189
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,922
He's trying to smoke us out!

190
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,925
Help me, Ed.

191
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,643
They'll see... Somebody...
They'll see and they'll...

192
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,486
They'll call someone.

193
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,045
They'll see.

194
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,846
Oh, my God, Ed.

195
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,562
It's just like the movie.

196
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,244
The movie I was
watching this morning.

197
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,165
With the guy all tied up.

198
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
The Gerhardt, on the TV.

199
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,371
There was this...
There was this couple.

200
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,365
This French...
And they were on the run.

201
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,242
From the Nazi...

202
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,323
And the husband,
or whatever he was,

203
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,006
he got shot, just like you.

204
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,685
But then they hid out in this...

205
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,048
Well, it wasn't a supermarket,
it was a farmhouse,

206
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,521
but they hid out,

207
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,446
and the Nazi tried to smoke 'em out.
Just like this.

208
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,445
But they got out!

209
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,485
Ed, they got out.

210
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,800
They were saved!

211
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,651
Ed.

212
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,927
Ed? Ed!

213
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,570
No! Ed?

214
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,005
Ed!

215
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,930
No.

216
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,604
Peggy! It's okay. It's okay.

217
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,647
It's me. It's me. Where is he?

218
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,846
Where is he? It's okay.

219
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,160
I'll kill him!
No, no, no. He's gone.

220
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,685
No, you're lying to me!
He's gone.

221
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,366
Put this down!
No, no! You stay back!

222
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,805
Where is he?
Where is the Indian?

223
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,531
Where is he? He tried
to smoke us out! Stop.

224
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,170
Just like in the movie!
Peggy, there's no smoke!

225
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,924
No! No. There's no smoke.

226
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,128
We need to check on Ed.
He's shot. He's shot!

227
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,522
He's shot and the Indian,
where is he?

228
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,206
He tried to light a fire,
just like in the movie!

229
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,281
Just like in the movie!

230
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,361
Where is he?

231
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,846
Peggy. Where's the Indian?

232
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,763
Just look at me. Okay...

233
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,161
He lit a fire. No, the
Indian got away, okay?

234
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,686
We followed Ed's
blood trail, okay?

235
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,841
Kicked in the door. Us.

236
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,450
No, he's here. The Indian
was never in the building.

237
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,721
No. He was. No.

238
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,564
Ed'll tell you. Ed.

239
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,563
Ed! Ed!

240
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,483
Come on, Ed, we're saved.

241
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,490
Ed, they're here!

242
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,289
We're rescued. Ed!

243
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,411
Ed? Ed!

244
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,690
Come on, Ed.

245
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,406
There's a manhunt
underway for our man.

246
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,206
He won't get far.

247
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,850
Local PD says your
father-in-law's in the ICU.

248
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,449
"Cautiously optimistic"
is the report.

249
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,045
What about your boss?

250
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,770
I don't even know
how to write this thing up.

251
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,571
Where to begin.

252
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,690
Well, like anything, I guess.

253
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,641
You know, start at the start
and work your way to the end.

254
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,046
Okay, then.

255
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,204
You're gonna be okay.

256
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,282
I'm gonna take Peggy Blumquist
back to Minnesota.

257
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,402
Anyone's got a problem
with that...

258
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,647
Well, after the week I've had,
they can keep it to themselves.

259
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,685
Mmm.

260
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,001
Morning.

261
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,241
Is Lou back? No.

262
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,725
So...

263
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,210
Is it...

264
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,480
Do you feel it?

265
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,965
Feel what?

266
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,687
My aunt lost her
bosom to cancer.

267
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,045
Said it felt like somebody took a hot
poker and put it through her heart.

268
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,406
No. Not like that.

269
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,326
Not yet.

270
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,288
You know how sometimes you get a
peach from the bowl and one side is

271
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,364
ripe and yellow, and the
other is black and moldy?

272
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,608
That's the only way
I can think to describe it.

273
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,329
Camus says knowing we're
gonna die makes life absurd.

274
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,089
Well, I don't know who that is,

275
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,010
but I'm guessing he doesn't
have a six-year-old girl.

276
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,531
He's French.

277
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,204
I don't care if he's from Mars.

278
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,965
Nobody with any sense would
say something that foolish.

279
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,247
We're put on this Earth
to do a job,

280
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,281
and each of us gets
the time we get to do it.

281
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,683
And when this life is over

282
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,080
and you stand
in front of the Lord...

283
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,849
Well, you try telling Him it
was all some Frenchman's joke.

284
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,610
Do you think...

285
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,968
Is there any chance
I could be tried federal?

286
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,726
Why?

287
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,402
I thought, well, maybe I could
serve my time in California.

288
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,370
There was this news
report on the TV

289
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,727
about how there's
this penitentiary

290
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,044
just north of San Francisco
that looks out on the bay?

291
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,804
Doesn't that sound nice?

292
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,609
Maybe see a pelican.

293
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,248
We'll see what we can do.

294
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,805
I was there at the end,
you know.

295
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,326
After the war, when Saigon fell.

296
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,243
On the USS Kirk,
patrolling the coast.

297
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,244
And when the country went,
it went fast.

298
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,483
And we had, like, you know,
24 hours to get everybody out.

299
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,684
But not just Americans, but our
allies, the South Vietnamese.

300
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,724
All packed onto
boats and helicopters.

301
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,881
We stood on the deck
and waved them in.

302
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,204
One by one, they'd land, unload,

303
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,291
and then we'd push
the whirlybirds into the sea.

304
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,361
Damnedest thing.

305
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,761
But then this Chinook comes,
and those things...

306
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,526
Well, you just can't land one
on a ship this size.

307
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,686
So we wave him off.

308
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,650
But the pilot's got
his whole family inside,

309
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,008
and he's running out of fuel,
so it's now or never.

310
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,727
So he hovers over the deck.

311
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,403
People start jumping,

312
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,127
scared or not, onto the ship.

313
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,322
There was a baby.

314
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,246
Literally, a tiny baby.

315
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,730
And the mother just...

316
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,770
Just drops him.

317
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,169
And one of my boys...

318
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,243
Like catching a ball...

319
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,161
He just sticks out his hands...

320
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,003
So, now, everybody's out,

321
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,562
and I'm thinking how the heck is this
pilot, right, how's he gonna get out?

322
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,166
But he maneuvers
off the port bow

323
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,971
and he hovers there
for the longest time doing,

324
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,929
you know, what we learn later,

325
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,522
uh, taking off his flight suit.

326
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,361
And somehow he rolls
the bird on its side,

327
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,330
and just before it
hits the water, he jumps.

328
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,807
Six thousand pounds,

329
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,089
angry helicopter parts
flying all around him.

330
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,848
And somehow he makes it.

331
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,124
How'd he do that?

332
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,409
What are you saying?

333
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,811
Your husband.

334
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,202
He said he was gonna protect
his family no matter what,

335
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,968
and I acted like
I didn't understand,

336
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,766
but I do.

337
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,921
It's the rock we all push, men.

338
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,447
We call it our burden, but...

339
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,528
It's really our privilege.

340
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,404
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

341
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,280
You know?

342
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,011
Not to Ed.

343
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,325
Not to anybody.

344
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,689
I just wanted to be someone.

345
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,402
Well, you're somebody now.

346
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,970
No. See,

347
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,044
I wanted to choose.

348
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,410
Be my own me.

349
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,484
Not be defined by
someone else's expectations...

350
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,610
And then that guy...
That stupid guy!

351
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,569
Walked out into the...

352
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,048
Why did he have to do that?

353
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,130
You mean the victim?

354
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,928
No. That's not fair.

355
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,282
'Cause I'm a victim, too.

356
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,123
Was a victim first.

357
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,407
Before him. Victim of what?

358
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,811
Well, it's...

359
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,920
You wouldn't understand,
you're a man.

360
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,084
It's a lie, okay?

361
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,282
That you can do it all.

362
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,410
Be a wife, and a mother, and
this self-made career woman...

363
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,847
Like there's 37 hours in a day.

364
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,211
And then, when you can't,
they say it's you.

365
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,850
You're faulty.

366
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,126
Like...

367
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,086
Like...

368
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,322
Like you are inferior somehow.

369
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,162
And then, like, if you could
just get your act together

370
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,000
until you're half-mad with...

371
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,844
People are dead, Peggy.

372
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,566
Stay put.

373
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,686
Solverson residence.

374
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,921
Oh, thank God.

375
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,967
Who is this? Noreen?

376
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,122
Is that you, Mr. Solverson?
Yeah.

377
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,690
We've been trying to...

378
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,888
I mean, all night
we've been calling,

379
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,008
and the operator didn't
know where you were...

380
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,401
What happened? Well, it's...

381
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,884
She's fine...

382
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,689
Just had a...

383
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,523
Well, she fell, is all.

384
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,127
Something about
the pills they gave her.

385
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,490
What do you mean, she fell?

386
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,609
Where's Molly?
She's here. At home.

387
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,526
We all are.

388
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,042
Your missus is sleeping and the
girl right there with her.

389
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,801
She's stubborn all right,
your daughter.

390
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,725
Your wife says she
gets that from you.

391
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,009
But the doctor...
He says your missus is fine.

392
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,004
Just needs rest and then to come
in next week for some more tests.

393
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,882
She's sleeping currently.

394
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,328
I told her I'd sit up with
Molly until you got home.

395
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,322
Okay, well, uh,

396
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,448
I got a suspect in custody.

397
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,171
On my way back from
Sioux Falls, so, uh...

398
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,771
Tell Betsy I'll be home soon as I can.
Okeydoke.

399
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,205
And, Noreen?

400
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,127
Thank you. You betcha.

401
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,249
And so, great empires fall
and are forgotten.

402
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,603
You're thinking, why Tripoli?

403
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,051
Well, Tripoli, not to be
confused with Levantine Tripoli

404
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,329
in the country of Lebanon,

405
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,007
was founded in Libya in the seventh
century by the Phoenicians.

406
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,963
Then was conquered
by the Romans.

407
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,368
And then by the Spanish
and then by the Turks.

408
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,442
You see where I'm going.

409
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,364
I need a face man.

410
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,963
His details are inside.

411
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,682
I'm assuming you want
more than just a skin peel.

412
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,807
Something structural...

413
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,329
A whole new man.

414
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,089
Like the phoenix,
rising from the ashes.

415
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,009
What'll you do then, I wonder.

416
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,088
Join a new empire?

417
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,522
Maybe start one of my own.

418
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,529
So that it, too,

419
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,729
may one day collapse
and fall into the sea.

420
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,283
Do I take it you'll try to
get revenge on Kansas City?

421
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,283
Apprehend those responsible?

422
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,924
'Cause you can bet Kansas City
will be heavily guarded.

423
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,885
Not apprehend.

424
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,401
Dead.

425
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,127
Don't care "heavily guarded."

426
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,807
Don't care "into the sea."

427
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,085
Kill and be killed.

428
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,126
Head in a bag.

429
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,406
Drop 'em down.

430
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,446
Put 'em down.

431
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,761
Dummy!

432
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,802
Look, you did good.

433
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,051
I had my doubts, but, uh, you
really brought this thing home.

434
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,885
I had a few breaks.
Don't do that.

435
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,850
Take praise and turn it
into something else.

436
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,126
You're right. I'm sorry.

437
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,725
And don't apologize.

438
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,529
You still got a few
rungs left to climb.

439
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,251
You're not gonna get there
saying you're sorry.

440
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,482
Got it. Thank you, sir.

441
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,321
I did.

442
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,483
I worked hard night and day
to get this done,

443
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,369
I don't mind telling you.

444
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,727
Which is why I was thinking,
for this setup in Fargo,

445
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,564
I'd like to handpick
a few men...

446
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,722
No, no, no.
That's the day-to-day stuff.

447
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,285
We got a team for that.

448
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,887
Asset managers, mid-level and below.
Drones, really.

449
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,405
They've already been deployed.

450
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,689
The real oversight of the new
northern territories...

451
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,003
Well, that happens right here,
in this building.

452
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,128
Which is where you want me.

453
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,248
Assuming you don't wanna be
a grunt your entire life.

454
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,044
No. Of course not.

455
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,523
Good. Then pay attention.

456
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,850
It's 9:00 to 5:00 mostly, but
management rewards initiative,

457
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,447
so, nights, weekends,
whatever gets the job done.

458
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,410
You'll be working closely with
the, uh, accounting department,

459
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,482
looking for ways to
optimize revenue.

460
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,804
Shorter shipping routes, less palms
to grease, that kind of thing.

461
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,086
The accounting department.

462
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,961
Yeah, and this whole, uh, Western thing.
That's gotta go.

463
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,882
Get something gray or pinstriped with
a white shirt, a real tie.

464
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,122
And cut your hair, okay?

465
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,567
The '70s are over, for Christ's sake.

466
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,010
See, I thought, well...

467
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,962
In the old days, when a
guy conquered a place...

468
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,644
You want the old days?

469
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,324
Go work in a coal mine.

470
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,243
This is the future.

471
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,129
Look, you and I got off
on the wrong foot,

472
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,124
but you seem like a good kid,
so let me give you a tip.

473
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,091
The sooner you realize there's only
one business left in the world...

474
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,449
The money business,
just ones and zeros,

475
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,090
the better off you're gonna be.

476
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,443
Sir, believe me, I'm an earner.

477
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,800
Yeah, yeah, but listen to me,

478
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,690
I'm not talking about
busting heads for collections.

479
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,604
I'm talking about
profit and loss...

480
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,250
Infrastructure.

481
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,644
See,

482
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,566
last year, Donahue in
the western branch...

483
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,688
He rejiggered the mail room,

484
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,084
ended up saving a million
a quarter in postage.

485
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,528
Now, management was so impressed

486
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,967
they gave him California.

487
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,646
The mail room? Yeah.

488
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,927
Why didn't I think
of that, right?

489
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,049
Uh, anyway, settle in.

490
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,408
Dale from HR's gonna come by with
a few forms for you to fill out,

491
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,721
health insurance, 401 k...

492
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,882
And then, uh, get to work.

493
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,123
Quarterly projections and revenue
statements are due on the 13th.

494
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,922
We're expecting
big things from you.

495
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,600
Oh, uh...

496
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,321
You play golf?

497
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,046
Golf?

498
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,043
It's a great game.
You should learn.

499
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,084
That's where all the deals
are being done these days.

500
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,124
Look who I found.

501
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,208
Poppa!

502
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,526
Ow! Careful, careful now.

503
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,761
Give your poppa some room.

504
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,841
No, no. Okay.

505
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,321
This is just
the medicine I need.

506
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,084
Well, you okay then?

507
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,571
You need to lie down? Nah.

508
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,641
No. No?

509
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,529
I'll take a beer though,
if you got one.

510
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,443
Lou? Hell, yes.

511
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,443
I mean, "heck." Heck.

512
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,046
I think we earned one or 10.

513
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,205
Hey, Sheriff.

514
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,046
Noreen.

515
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,084
Heard you're, uh, running
the place now. Oh...

516
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,084
It's mostly just
babysitting and laundry.

517
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,969
She's been a real lifesaver.

518
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,485
Come on, squirt.

519
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,289
Let's get your party dress on.

520
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,129
See you in the funny papers.

521
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,561
Well...

522
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,211
More pie, Dad?

523
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,409
Not unless you want me
to burst my stitches.

524
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,441
So...

525
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,406
You gonna put that
in your report then?

526
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,324
What? Gunfight interrupted
by a spacecraft?

527
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,371
Yeah, maybe leave that subtext.

528
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,408
And this Hanzee fella?

529
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,051
Uh...

530
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,329
Made the FBI's Most Wanted.

531
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,563
First one of those I worked,
but so far, nothing.

532
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,451
Probably fled the border
to Winnipeg or Points North.

533
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,165
Yeah. He'll
show up again, I'm sure...

534
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,284
Like it or not.

535
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,009
You okay, hon? Yeah, sure.

536
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,445
It's just a cramp.

537
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,010
We're a sad bunch, huh?

538
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,085
Next thing, Lou will be
grouching about his sciatica.

539
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,288
Yeah.

540
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,128
Well, we're sitting
here together.

541
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,965
That's what matters.

542
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,365
A man once said,

543
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,527
"You'll know the angels
when they come,

544
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,771
"'cause they'll have
the faces of your children."

545
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,011
Anyway. Um...

546
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,642
Just happy to
see you is all, Bet.

547
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,848
So, Dad, I fed your cats while
you were in the hospital.

548
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,847
And they're grateful, I'm sure.
Yeah.

549
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,001
And when I went over there
the first time...

550
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,445
I went in your office.

551
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,526
Ah...

552
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,645
So, uh...

553
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,371
Well, okay.

554
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,521
So...

555
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,204
After your mother died,
I got to feeling pretty low.

556
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,371
We all did.

557
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,563
And I took... Well, you
remember, I took some time off.

558
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,883
And I started thinking...

559
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,082
Which I know is dangerous...

560
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,726
But, you know,

561
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,805
the things I've seen...

562
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,886
In the war,

563
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,882
and at home, on the job...

564
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,847
So much senselessness.

565
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,642
Violence, you know?
And I got to thinking about...

566
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,162
About miscommunication.

567
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,440
Like how, isn't that
the root of it?

568
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,249
Conflict, war... Doesn't it
all come down to language?

569
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,764
Right? The words we say
and the words we hear,

570
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,604
which aren't always
the same thing.

571
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,923
So, I thought, you know, what
if there was one language?

572
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,522
A universal language of
symbols, 'cause pictures,

573
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,931
to my mind,
are clearer than words.

574
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,202
So, that's what that is?

575
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,445
In your office.

576
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,442
You're making your own language.

577
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,964
Well, it sounds crazy when
you say it out loud, I know.

578
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,726
But...

579
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,961
You know, when we see
a box with a roof on it,

580
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,171
well, everyone knows
that means home.

581
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,484
You know, and my six-year-old
granddaughter, she draws a heart.

582
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,289
It means love. No question.

583
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,971
Anyway.

584
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,085
That's where I started,
you know, with simple ideas,

585
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,008
and the more I worked on it,

586
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,007
the more it became
all I could think about.

587
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,850
You're a good man.

588
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,442
Well, I don't know about that,

589
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,805
but I like to think
I got good intentions.

590
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,368
What do you say
tomorrow we go fishing?

591
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,531
Okay.

592
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,851
Get some sleep, you.

593
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,363
Good night, Mr. Solverson.

594
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,564
Good night, Mrs. Solverson.

595
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,482
And all the ships at sea.
