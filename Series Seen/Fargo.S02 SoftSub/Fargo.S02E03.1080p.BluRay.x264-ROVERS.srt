1
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,203
My husband wants to
thank you for comin'.

2
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,327
Course.

3
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,801
We know which side
of the bread gets buttered.

4
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,561
We know how to butter bread.

5
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,210
You don't have to yell.
He's not deaf.

6
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,721
I... I didn't...

7
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,689
What's wrong with him, then?

8
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,649
He had a stroke. A mild stroke.

9
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,210
He can't walk or talk.

10
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,884
For now he can't.

11
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,724
One day, though.

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,721
He's still

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,406
the same lion inside.

14
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,005
But until he's better,
you talk to me.

15
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,491
That's right.

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,561
Talk to Ma.

17
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,167
She's in charge.

18
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,802
Also, we wanna thank you
for your cards and letters.

19
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,245
Are you kiddin' me?
Cards and letters?

20
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,084
We're in a state of siege and
you're talkin' about cards...

21
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,241
Boys.

22
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,920
You know about
the offer on the table?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,002
Kansas City?

24
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,447
The money's good, you know.

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,601
More than fair.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,524
Sure, but what they don't
tell ya is, after ya sign,

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,090
they take your balls
with a straight razor,

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,565
and fatten ya up
like a house cat.

29
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,130
Language! Gimme a break.

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,602
I'm sayin',
this is our business.

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,890
We built it with blood and muscle.
It's earned.

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,291
And ya can't just
write a check...

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,441
This family has been...

34
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,726
Ya can't just write a check!

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,525
This family has been a
peacetime family since Kennedy.

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,366
You think we
just out of the blue

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,885
pick up our guns
and it's High Noon?

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,804
We're talkin' about
the Kansas City mafia.

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,771
They're like all
the sharks in the sea.

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,844
And we're... Let's be honest.

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,570
We're small-time.

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,530
Know thyself.

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,729
What are you on about?

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,930
It's in the Bible.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,327
I'm sayin' we hit
'em and hit 'em hard.

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,165
Otherwise, wither and die.
Right, Pop?

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,842
Look, it's not just the business.
It's the country.

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,888
This no-brains Jimmy Carter
with his stupid peanut grin.

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,122
And now I gotta wait in line
to fill my tank?

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,804
Exactly. Where does it end?

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,121
Enough. All of you.

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,646
It may be we have to fight.

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,848
And I'm not afraid of a war.

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,805
I'm not.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,360
But on my terms,

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,283
as a last resort.

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,727
So I need to know now,

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,131
are you with me?

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,608
Well, look.

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,603
We talked,

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,728
and we're not sayin',
"Yes, we're goin' to war."

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,291
But we recognize promises
were made in blood.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,964
Generations ago.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,041
Hmm.

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,443
What he's sayin' is, we're not
gonna make the first move.

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,126
But if these Kansas City mooks
come at ya shootin',

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,767
we'll cut the goddamn
nose off their face.

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,805
Mmm-hmm.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,125
- Late.
- Sorry.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,523
Couldn't get the shampoo
out of my hair.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,204
It's soft water.

72
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,401
Say what?

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,450
This goddamn northern water.
It's slick to the touch.

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,126
Yeah, I thought it
was the shampoo.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,205
Could be that, too.
I always carry my own. Agree.

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,406
Agree to what?

77
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,842
That's the brand. Agree.

78
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,720
No additives.
It works, hard water or soft.

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,325
Feel my hair.

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,367
Yeah, that's nice.

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,570
So update's this. Nothin' on the
Gerhardt Frau as to yes or no.

82
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,001
I didn't expect it, but still.

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,050
Research thinks that
they'll stall, then pass.

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,241
So we kill 'em.

85
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,850
Maybe.

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,649
If the market says
kill 'em, we kill 'em.

87
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,405
If the market says offer more
money, we offer more money.

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,211
Whatever the pluses
and minuses dictate.

89
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,330
And on the Gerhardt kid,
this Rye?

90
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,926
Get this.
He gunned down a judge,

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,765
some small hick town a couple
hours south from here,

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,291
then disappeared.

93
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,245
On the run now, we're thinkin'.

94
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,563
On the run is good.
On the run, we can use.

95
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,763
Find him. You, not them.

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,171
Then he's leverage
over the Frau,

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,564
and maybe turn things our way without
buyin' a bunch of extra bullets.

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,009
Car 18. Over.

99
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,362
This is 18. Over.

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,161
I got the Rock County sheriff on the line.
Hold. Over.

101
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,047
Went by the house.
Betsy says you're up in Fargo.

102
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,726
Yeah. Went to see about
our judge's caseload.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,485
Maybe there's a connection
with our shooter. Over.

104
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,771
Well, I'm calling 'cause
we got a print match

105
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,046
off of that gun you found.

106
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,680
Right index belonged
to one Rye Gerhardt,

107
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,367
which, I looked up,
is the youngest male heir

108
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,125
to that Gerhardt
syndicate out of Fargo.

109
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,971
Ya don't say. Over.

110
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,566
Yup. So there's that.

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,324
Okay, well, I'll mention
that to Fargo PD.

112
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,164
Probably be back
late tonight, though.

113
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,971
You wanna tell Betsy
not to wait up for me? Over.

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,246
Okay, then.

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,724
Sounds good. Over.

116
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,927
Over and out, I guess.

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,283
How ya doin'?

118
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,885
Ya know. Waitin'.

119
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,206
Lou Solverson,
Minnesota State Police.

120
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,408
Drove up from Luverne.

121
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,768
Ben Schmidt. Forensics' inside.

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,242
Takin' their time.

123
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,651
Yeah.

124
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,447
Heard the crime
Mmm. scene was a deal.

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,287
I'm workin' things up here.

126
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,127
Thought, maybe tomorrow,
drive down, take a look.

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,126
You're welcome to.

128
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,005
Or I can send ya the photos.
They're pretty thorough.

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,404
Three dead, including the judge.
Fry cook and a waitress also.

130
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,970
Shot multiple times.

131
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,204
Got the prints back
on the gun just before.

132
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,725
Rye Gerhardt?

133
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,561
That bad, huh?

134
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,250
I'm not sayin' your
life would be easier

135
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,765
if it was your own
prints on the gun,

136
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,490
but that's the lines along
which you should be thinkin'.

137
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,243
Distribution, right? Gerhardts?

138
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,367
Yeah.

139
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,450
Dieter, that's Otto's dad, started
runnin' booze during Prohibition,

140
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,443
ended up buildin'
a truckin' empire.

141
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,202
1951, he gets 19
bullets in the head.

142
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,487
That's when the son,
Otto, he takes over,

143
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,202
which is like, the good news
is, World War I is over.

144
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,807
The bad news is,
say hello to Adolf Hitler.

145
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,207
And the shooter
is Otto's youngest?

146
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,085
Yeah. Yeah, the runt.

147
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,210
Basically wind and swagger. Except,
I guess he's more than that now.

148
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,681
Say...

149
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,363
You ever heard of a Mike Milligan
or the Kitchen Brothers?

150
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,684
Out of Kansas City.

151
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,329
Caught 'em sniff in' around
the crime scene.

152
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,482
But nothin' to
hold 'em on, so...

153
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,847
You, uh... You in the service?

154
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,567
Navy. Two tours. Swift Boat.
I was a lieutenant.

155
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,362
Infantry for me,
outside Da Nang.

156
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,411
And we had a sayin'. Fubar.

157
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,562
Yeah, we had that, too.

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,562
So when you put a dead judge,
the Gerhardt family,

159
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,440
and some hitters from Kansas
City in a bag together,

160
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,124
I go back to thinkin'
it might be best

161
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,043
just to confess to
the crime myself,

162
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,770
go live a long life
in a cell somewhere

163
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,604
with hot and cold runnin' water.

164
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,771
He got a place
in town, then, your uncle?

165
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,881
Rye?

166
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,247
Something he
doesn't tell people.

167
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,526
Where he can do his business?

168
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,965
You mean nail girls?

169
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,644
Girls, drugs.

170
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,645
I don't know.

171
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,091
I don't.

172
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,281
I mean, maybe.

173
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,721
Okay, maybe I've been there.

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,689
With a boy or to
score some weed.

175
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,446
No drugs, your dad says. Says
anyone sells to you gets the ax.

176
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,842
Jeez. You're all
a bunch of squares.

177
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,691
Sometimes, a girl just wants
to bust a nut, you know?

178
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,885
It's over on 13th somewhere.

179
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,920
Near the train station, I think.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,526
Not like I memorized
the address.

181
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,046
Show me.

182
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,563
If you know

183
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,202
If you know someone

184
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,843
who's been looking

185
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
for true love

186
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,602
Send her to me

187
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,884
Oh, yeah Send her to me

188
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,931
I'm looking too

189
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,045
It's supposed to fall out, they say.
With the chemo.

190
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,927
Donna Pearlman
lost hers overnight.

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,289
Woke up, thought there was a
dog sleepin' on her pillow.

192
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,089
Not everyone loses it.

193
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,931
We could just wait and see.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,846
Part of me thinks I should
just shave it off. Be bald.

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,929
My cousin had a melanoma.

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,243
Didn't lose a single hair.
Lost her eyebrows though.

197
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,563
Now that'd be a horror show.

198
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,807
So, I decided. I wanna do it.

199
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,363
What's that, hon? The seminar.

200
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,842
I thought about it,
and I think I should.

201
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,322
I'm so happy! So happy!

202
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,566
What seminar?

203
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,964
It's called Lifespring.
Did it last year in Mankato?

204
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,405
Amazing.

205
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,481
Oh.

206
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Yeah, and I just... You know, I wanna
be the best me I can be, ya know?

207
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,329
Good for you.

208
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,443
What did Ed say
when you asked him?

209
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,044
You didn't, did ya?

210
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,444
You naughty girl.

211
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,010
We were busy.

212
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,561
Ladies.

213
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,880
Hi, Dad.

214
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,803
Spoke to your man
on the wireless.

215
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,723
Said to say he's
gonna be late tonight.

216
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,087
Yeah, I thought he might.

217
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,207
Whatcha got there?

218
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,045
Connie, ya mind if I put
one of those up in your window?

219
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,121
No.

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,050
Okay, Mrs. Blaycock.
You can head to the dryer.

221
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,124
Is that him? The one
killed those poor people?

222
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,720
We think so. Yeah.

223
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,484
City boy, turns out.

224
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,282
Rye Gerhardt. Raised without the
proper moral fiber, I'm thinkin'.

225
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,011
I mean, to kill
all those people.

226
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,128
And for what?
You know, a little money?

227
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,441
You know,
I was thinkin' last night.

228
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,323
That shoe you found in the tree?

229
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,810
What if that's got something
to do with the murders?

230
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,405
Somethin' how?

231
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,088
Well, you said yourself, the
shooter left his vehicle behind?

232
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,289
So, I'm thinkin' what if he
walked out onto the road

233
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,721
and got himself hit by a car?

234
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,768
- Like a hit-and-run?
- Yeah.

235
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,047
I mean, you found
glass in the road.

236
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,281
Yeah. Yeah. Right?

237
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,964
And skid marks?

238
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,411
So, I'm thinkin', what if the
killer goes after poor Denise,

239
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,969
shoots her in the parkin' lot

240
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,045
and then inadvertently gets himself
struck by a passin' motorist?

241
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,606
Hey, Peg, didn't you say that...

242
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,569
I'm sorry, but that
just don't make sense.

243
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,120
I mean, how come
the motorist don't stop?

244
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,044
If they hit a person.
Run 'em over, I mean.

245
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,084
Yeah, I'm inclined
to agree with Peggy.

246
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,050
It's not like you're
gonna just drive home

247
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,804
with a Gerhardt
in your windshield

248
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,689
and, you know, start supper.

249
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,807
All I'm sayin' is,

250
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,360
maybe rather than
lookin' for a man

251
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,601
you should be lookin' for a car.

252
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,169
- We gotta...
- Hiya, Peggy.

253
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,801
Hey, Noreen. Ed, we gotta...
Get your coat.

254
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,006
Hi. What's...

255
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,127
Hi.

256
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,441
Noreen, hon. We've got a...

257
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,320
Well, it's a family crisis is
what it is, so I need to...

258
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,006
Will you tell Bud I'll have
him back after lunch, okay?

259
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,081
Whatever.

260
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,650
Slow down. They know.

261
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,767
Know what?

262
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,841
About the accident.

263
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,527
There's a theory. Betsy Solverson.
She said hit-and-run.

264
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,045
So we gotta deal with the car.

265
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,521
Okay, yeah. But, just slow down.

266
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,011
I don't understand what your...

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,526
I can't slow down!
The clock's goin'.

268
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,251
Like I said, there's a theory,
so we gotta deal with the car.

269
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,481
Now. Today.

270
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,801
Deal how? It's broad daylight.

271
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,284
Sorry, Officer. Did I...
Am I in a loadin' zone?

272
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,442
Sir, let me see some ID.

273
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,686
Yeah. Is there...

274
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,927
Am I in trouble or...

275
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,169
"Skip"? That's your
Christian name?

276
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,004
Yes, sir. Skip Sprang.

277
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,811
Carriage Typewriters.
Grand reopening coming soon.

278
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,120
Reopening?

279
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,647
Well, we're still open.
Technically, yeah.

280
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,884
That is, if you're looking for
a classic, can't do better.

281
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,962
But the new models are...

282
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,165
They'll be in any day.
Beauties. All electric.

283
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,403
State-of-the-art. They're not
just for women anymore, ya know?

284
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,002
What's got you
here at court today?

285
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,166
Well, sir. Had a hearing,
but it's been postponed.

286
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,890
Hearing on?

287
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,601
Small bother, uh, back taxes.

288
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,845
Nothin' scandalous.

289
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,447
But time-sensitive,
if you get my...

290
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,448
On account of I need, you know,
cash to cover the new models, see?

291
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,487
Is that why you went by
Judge Mundt's office?

292
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,927
Did what?

293
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,604
Oh! Uh...

294
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,209
Yeah, I heard what
happened about the...

295
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,080
And, I mean, condolences
to the family and all,

296
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,960
but, like I said, lives
hang in the balance here.

297
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,046
And time is, ya know, tickin'
down to get the typewriters,

298
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,327
spaceships really,

299
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,883
outta, ya know, hock.

300
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,770
What do ya think?

301
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,127
He's a squirrelly fella.

302
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,603
Might be worth bringing him down
to the station, diggin' down.

303
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,130
Yeah, I don't...

304
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,724
I mean, how many cases
she have, our judge?

305
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,121
Can't go diggin'
down on every sad sack.

306
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,043
Exactly. You said it.

307
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,441
A few back taxes.
It's not like I'm even...

308
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,602
Sir. Yeah, okay.

309
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,689
Okay, Mr. Sprang.

310
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,481
You have a nice day.

311
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,370
Okay, then. Thanks much.

312
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,163
Spaceships, really?

313
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,242
"They're not just
for women anymore"?

314
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,251
Gerhardts?

315
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,162
No avoidin' it, I suppose.

316
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,521
Rye!

317
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,721
Come on! Open the... It's...

318
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,646
Lemme in!

319
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,321
And here I was,
sittin' on my hands.

320
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,562
Now look what Santa brought me.

321
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,124
A little man.

322
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,202
Whatcha doin' here, little man?

323
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,009
I'm...

324
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,447
I'm lookin' for Rye?

325
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,126
You look like you
could use a drink.

326
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,690
Uh...

327
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,364
Or at least watch me drink mine.

328
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,170
Get so lonely here by myself.

329
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,767
Hell, I may even dance for ya.

330
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,524
Jeez, who's...

331
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,648
Don't worry about him.

332
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,324
He's boring.

333
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,408
Lemme guess. You're the partner.

334
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,171
The...

335
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,686
Rye said, "I got this new deal,

336
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,883
workin' with a fella downtown,"

337
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,691
so I'm thinkin'
you're the fella downtown.

338
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,368
No, not... I'm...
My name is Skip.

339
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,690
I just come to
pay off some debts.

340
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,323
Gamblin', ponies.

341
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,290
Oh. Okay, then. Pay me.

342
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,567
Well, I don't actually
have the money on me.

343
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,127
I was just... Come by to say,
you know, I'll have it soon.

344
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,603
So, you came by to
not pay my uncle.

345
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,091
And you a patriot to boot.

346
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,960
Well, I mean, greatest
country on Earth, yeah?

347
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,887
Uh... My tie?

348
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,725
I think you and me
should go for a drive.

349
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,088
Like I said, I... Ya know,
there's some appointments...

350
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,688
Sucks to your appointments.
I say, let's have some fun.

351
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,126
What do you say, red man?
Should we have some fun?

352
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,611
You betcha.

353
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,043
Well, that's
the tree I was thinkin'.

354
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,529
Ya want me to do it?

355
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,409
No. I... Better me.

356
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,289
You sure about this plan?

357
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,444
It'll work.

358
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,409
Like I said,

359
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,166
my uncle used to drive his
truck and drink Old Milwaukee,

360
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,651
and, ya know,
insurance don't wanna pay

361
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,881
for accidents when you're drunk.

362
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,645
So, he came up with this plan.

363
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,643
Every crackup,
he'd drive his truck

364
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,001
to some deserted
spot till he sobered up,

365
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,482
fake a new accident to cover
the damage he did drinkin'.

366
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,891
Well, it's creative.

367
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,522
So that's what we do. We cover
the damage, file a report.

368
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,490
And then, I mean,
that should do it.

369
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,085
We got rid of the...

370
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,401
I mean, the guy's all ground up,

371
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,006
and ya burned his
clothes ya said, so...

372
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,481
Once the car's fixed, it's...

373
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,410
We're free.

374
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,043
You been a real paladin.

375
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,965
What's that?

376
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,644
It's like a knight.

377
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,966
My knight.

378
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,726
Well, I mean, you're my wife.

379
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,969
Okay, so you
should probably get out.

380
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,847
Ya got the one shiner already.

381
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,721
Okay.

382
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,406
Watch your toes now.

383
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,928
I mean, what are the odds?

384
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,283
Black ice and you doin' a 180,
hittin' the tree with the back?

385
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,442
You could run that scenario
a thousand times

386
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,602
and never end up
with these circumstances.

387
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,206
Yeah, I got it right
the second time, though.

388
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,565
Yeah, you did.

389
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,890
I think I got the whiplash.

390
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,607
Come on, hon.

391
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,647
If they ask, I backed into
the garage door, okay?

392
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,884
Still going, huh?

393
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,042
Grandma's working it out.

394
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,525
She thinks maybe
we can maybe sell

395
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,001
Kansas City
a piece of the business.

396
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,320
Not all.

397
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,610
Didn't look like fellas
who want to own a half a car.

398
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,481
Need ya to go back to school tomorrow.
Dunlop'll drive you.

399
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,561
No way.

400
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,604
It's gonna get inky 'round
here for a while, most likely.

401
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,762
I'd be worried you're
gonna catch a stray.

402
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,285
I can help.

403
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,005
Naw. I promised your ma
I'd keep you out of it.

404
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,924
Get ya good and educated so you
can make something of yourself.

405
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,685
Am something already,
though, aren't I?

406
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,841
A Gerhardt.

407
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,967
We're not negotiating.

408
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,885
This is a top-down decision.

409
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,530
Grandma agrees.

410
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,806
Uncle Dodd says I...

411
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,121
Dodd's got nothing
to do with it!

412
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,282
You're my son.

413
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,850
He's got his girls so he decides

414
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,809
what happens to them,
but you're mine.

415
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,283
Like I said, Grandma agrees.

416
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,647
Main Car 22. Over.

417
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,482
This is Car 22. Copy.

418
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,402
Yeah, Car 22. Got a situation...

419
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,164
Not too late to
go to the movies.

420
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,561
We can drive
along there if you like.

421
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,449
- Over. Over.
- Copy that.

422
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,605
Gonna need your guns.

423
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,529
I'll hold on to mine.

424
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,966
It's got sentimental value.

425
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,160
Well, you're not getting
inside with that on your hip.

426
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,245
Am I the only one
here who's clear

427
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,765
on the concept of
law enforcement?

428
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,964
Is that Ben Schmidt?

429
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,561
Mrs. Gerhardt.

430
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,046
I heard about Otto.

431
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,321
We're beset on all sides.
How's your mother?

432
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,164
Off the crutches, thanks.

433
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,721
Who's that?

434
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,606
Lou Solverson, Minnesota State.

435
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,125
Up from Luverne.

436
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,165
Yeah, they had some senselessness
there a few days back,

437
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,288
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to talk about.

438
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,169
What kind of senselessness?

439
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,811
Three dead,
including a state judge.

440
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,205
Yeah, Judge Mundt?

441
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,649
Everything okay here, Mom?

442
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,007
Not sure yet.

443
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,731
Somethin' about a dead judge.

444
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,609
Not sure how it falls to us.

445
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,729
Ma'am, we found the murder
weapon at the scene.

446
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,564
Prints came back this mornin'.

447
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,167
And?

448
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,681
We're gonna have to talk to Rye.

449
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,682
That's not gonna happen.

450
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,250
You need to leave.

451
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,206
Mrs. Gerhardt, if either
of these men draw,

452
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,045
I'm gonna be forced to shoot some
people and I don't wanna do that.

453
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,050
Now, your son's wanted in
connection with three murders.

454
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,521
And I'm guessing that's not the first
time you heard somebody say that.

455
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,683
So however it is you wanna handle
this, you need to handle it now.

456
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,489
Or it'll get handled for ya.

457
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,244
Everybody go easy.

458
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,491
You okay, Ma?

459
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,369
Maude Schmidt's
boy here is tryin'

460
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,124
to tell me your
brother killed a judge.

461
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,725
Nobody killed a judge!

462
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,286
We own all the judges. What'd
be the point of killin' one?

463
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,361
Now, Dodd.

464
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,488
Don't you Dodd me.
We're not friends.

465
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,047
We found Rye's
prints on the gun.

466
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,964
You're gonna find my boot on your
neck, you keep talkin' like that.

467
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,520
Well, now, to be fair,
I'm the one who found the gun.

468
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,807
So I think you're dancin'
with the wrong girl.

469
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,721
What'd you say?

470
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,687
I says, I'm the one
who found the gun.

471
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,966
So you should be talkin' to me.

472
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,485
And I'm from outta town, so forgive
me if I should be terrified,

473
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,963
but in Minnesota, when a police
officer says talk, you talk.

474
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,521
You wanna dance?

475
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,601
Let's dance.

476
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,889
Ben, you need to teach
your friend some manners.

477
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,807
How about Mike Milligan,
outta Kansas City?

478
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,125
You know where we can find him?

479
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,771
Pretty sure he's lookin'
for your brother, too.

480
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,802
Uncle Dodd?

481
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,411
Uncle Dodd? Hanzee called.

482
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,686
Not now.

483
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,242
Said it's real important. He
wants ya to meet him at the dig.

484
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,086
We're done here.

485
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,001
You heard my son. We've
said all we're gonna say.

486
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,560
Give him his gun back.
Get him outta here.

487
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,641
Okay.

488
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,925
Time to go.

489
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,290
Well, we could get a warrant.

490
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,604
From what judge? You heard Dodd.
They own most of the town.

491
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,648
Hey, pull over, huh?

492
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,922
The typewriter guy?
Yeah, like I said.

493
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,445
He was squirrelly.

494
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,806
Hey, I gotta get back,
and talk to my boss.

495
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,847
But... Sure. Sure.

496
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,160
...station's just a few
blocks if you wanna...

497
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,725
Sure.

498
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,882
Thanks for showin'
me around today.

499
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,961
Yeah.

500
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,761
Uh-uh.

501
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,209
What are ya,
havin' a baby in there?

502
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,929
Hello. You didn't tell me your
family was in from outta town.

503
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,248
Uh-uh. Whoops.

504
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,409
Gotta ask you
your business here.

505
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,606
Maybe I'm the owner.

506
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,761
No.

507
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,170
Met the owner this mornin'.

508
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,648
Is that right? Maybe tell us where he is.
Make a few bucks.

509
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,890
I was gonna ask you the same.

510
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,211
Say, you wouldn't by any chance

511
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,682
be Mike Milligan and the
Kitchen Brothers, would you?

512
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,481
You make us sound
like a prog rock band.

513
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,762
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing

514
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,366
Mike Milligan and
the Kitchen Brothers.

515
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,240
Double whoops.

516
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,641
Easy.

517
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,970
Minnesota cop.

518
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,809
You do know you're in
North Dakota, right?

519
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,724
Must've got lost on
the way to the lake.

520
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,690
So, where'd you
say you saw old Skip?

521
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,287
At your mother's house, I
think, goin' in the back door.

522
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,011
I like him.

523
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,130
I like you.

524
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,126
Met another fella
from Minnesota yesterday.

525
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,282
Big guy? Sheriff, I think?

526
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,490
I liked him, too.

527
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,450
We're a very friendly people.

528
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,682
No. That's not it.

529
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,322
Pretty unfriendly, actually.

530
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,041
But it's the way
you're unfriendly.

531
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,128
How you're so polite about it,

532
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,087
like you're doin' me a favor.

533
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,770
Well, this has been enjoyable,
but I better get goin'.

534
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,371
What did Nixon call it?

535
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,082
Peace with honor.

536
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,846
Somethin' like that.

537
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,686
Naw. You stay.

538
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,361
We've seen everything
there is to see.

539
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,530
I am not a crook.

540
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,401
Rapid fire.

541
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,881
Some round. Some oval.

542
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,200
What's that, friend?

543
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,568
Circular patterns, unnatural,

544
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,803
bright, hovering in the sky.

545
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,681
You know, they come only in the odd months.
The visitors.

546
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,331
Always in sets of three.

547
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,687
Such a night was
two nights past.

548
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,570
Reports from
Mankato to Vermillion.

549
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,609
- Visitors?
- From above.

550
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,928
Some say they take
you to their ship

551
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,287
and probe you in places
ya don't wanna mention.

552
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,445
I believe their purposes
are more benevolent.

553
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,330
As the caretaker to the zoo.

554
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,165
When strange happenings occur,
they are near.

555
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,605
Strange happenings, huh?

556
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,042
I wondered what
was causing that.

557
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,329
You think it worked?

558
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,809
What's that, hon?

559
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,451
I said, do you think it worked?

560
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,568
Today with the car?

561
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,245
It worked.

562
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,611
I dunno how you can be so sure.

563
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,245
It worked.

564
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,886
Hiya, hon.

565
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,961
Dad's here.

566
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,041
Oh!

567
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,641
Hank.

568
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,730
That's a go.

569
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,646
Sit.

570
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,448
Let me get you some divinity.

571
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,965
Won't say no.

572
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,288
Go see the Gerhardts, then?

573
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,569
It's been real
High Noon, my day.

574
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,725
Gerhardts, and ran into those
Kansas City fellas you pulled over.

575
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,681
Milligan?

576
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,607
And, yeah,
the bathroom brothers. Yeah.

577
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,001
Yeah, ones that don't talk.

578
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,484
We pointed our
weapons at each other

579
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,927
for a bit before
calling it a day.

580
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,564
Maybe two pieces of cake, then.

581
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,290
Sounds right.

582
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,445
Hiya. Hi.

583
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,526
You okay?

584
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,443
Yeah. No complaints.

585
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,850
Playing cribbage
or hold your horses there?

586
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,967
Yeah.

587
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,321
You-know-who's cheatin'.

588
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,686
Who's cheatin' Dad, huh?

589
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,207
Come on.

590
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,611
By the way,
I looked at your hand...

591
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,724
Hargreaves was quoted as saying,

592
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,241
"For little green men,
they were very friendly."

593
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,970
Boy, it takes all kinds,
doesn't it?

594
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,168
The cold front will continue
for the next week or so,

595
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,083
with temperatures
well below zero.

596
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,891
Your complete weather, sports, and
news update coming up this hour...

597
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,527
Get back in the goddamn truck.

598
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,490
What are you talkin' about?
I got him!

599
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,042
And button up that coat.
You're embarrassin' me.

600
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,841
Yeah?

601
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,324
You wanna hit me again?

602
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,845
Is that gettin' ya hard?

603
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,609
I wanted a boy. What does God give me?

604
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,284
Four goddamn girls.

605
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,283
Please, sir. This is a huge...

606
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,771
Shut up.

607
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,922
We know about the judge and the
typewriters and the taxes.

608
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,287
And we know you were puttin'
ideas into his head.

609
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,125
And all I wanna hear outta your
mouth right now is where he is.

610
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,247
Who?

611
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,771
If you knew the day I'm havin'.

612
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,041
Tell him!

613
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,481
Why would I go by Rye's place, yellin'
his name, if I knew where he was?

614
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,766
You talk to the cops?

615
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,726
In the hole.

616
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,041
What?

617
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,969
Look, I can find him. I can...

618
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,725
If you gimme a day, two days...

619
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,447
Lie down.

620
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,801
On the ground?

621
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,971
Please!

622
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,681
I'm not the one you wanna...

623
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,041
Talk to Milligan! They got him.

624
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,881
What'd you say?

625
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,522
Came by yesterday. Looking for Rye.
Probably they found him.

626
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,045
I'm just...

627
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,485
I could call, make a deal.
I got capital.

628
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,562
You don't know anything.

629
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,969
No, no, no!

630
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,690
You're gonna drive down to
that shithole Minnesota town

631
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,087
and you're gonna bring
my brother back tonight.

632
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,321
Judge or no judge.

633
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,529
If Kansas City gets in your way,
if the cops get in your way,

634
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,610
if anybody gets in your way,
you kill 'em dead.
