1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,206
Erstwhile on Fargo...

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,931
I'm not afraid of a war.
But are you with me?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,048
We're not gonna
make the first move.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,603
But if these Kansas City mooks
come at ya shootin',

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,611
we'll cut the goddamn
nose off their face.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,205
Your Indian killed him.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,526
I didn't know
that was happening.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,251
I wanna know what they're
gonna do before they do it.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,727
Otherwise, you can die
with the rest of 'em.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,163
You sent my goddamn son?

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,406
The kid said it should be family

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,806
that pulls the trigger,
which is true.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,326
He's 17.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,209
Sheriff? Go inside now, Peggy.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,929
When I find you, darling,
I'm gonna make you bleed.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,841
And that,
there's a word for that.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,367
It's called "managing up".

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,691
Which, if you want to rise to any
kind of power in this organization,

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,250
is something you'd better learn.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,731
Because they'll say to you,
"Go out, do the job,

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,689
"and don't worry."

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,161
But in fact, what they mean...

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,331
Is talk them through it.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,731
You understand?

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,126
It doesn't matter if
it's washing machines

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,171
or cocaine,
whores or horseradish,

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,089
they, the powers that be,
they need to know...

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,767
In the shuffling madness

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,087
Of the locomotive breath

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,924
Runs the all-time loser

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,961
Headlong to his death

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,889
Oh, he feels the piston scraping

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,003
Steam breaking on his brow

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,810
Oh, thank God,
he stole the handle

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,283
And the train
it won't stop going

36
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,727
No way to slow down

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,608
Oh, oh

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,321
He sees his children jumping off

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,648
At the stations, one by one

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,681
His woman and his best friend

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,566
In bed and having fun

42
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,402
Oh, oh, he's
crawling down the corridor

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,285
On his hands and knees

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,124
Old Charlie stole the handle

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,723
And the train
it won't stop going

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,167
No way to slow down

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,006
Hey, hey

48
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,845
We waited.

49
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,966
I don't like funerals.

50
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,844
Nobody likes funerals.

51
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,650
We wanna thank you boys from coming
out from Buffalo, helping us out.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,488
We couldn't have fought
them off much longer.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,289
Forget about it.

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,968
I'm seeing cows, horses,
what do you have... Chickens?

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,725
It's like wild goddamn
kingdom in here.

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,926
We got ups and downs.

57
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,166
Tell me.

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,844
Go see to lunch.

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,049
I'm grown. I can hear.

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,843
We got five of theirs.
Including management.

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,086
But they felled
Roost and Seymour.

62
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,961
That means South
Dakota's turned.

63
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,091
Which Bear now tells
me is where they got

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,401
the presidents' faces up
on the side of a rock?

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,089
So we should get that back.

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,881
Nothing from Hanzee? Nothing.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,647
Two days.

68
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,442
What about my dad?

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,324
Gonna need a third
hole is my feeling.

70
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,409
Have some respect.

71
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,924
My lion didn't raise that boy to
be killed by small-town muscle.

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,565
Thought that about Rye.

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,685
Now there's nothing
left but clothes.

74
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,524
They're just men.

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,567
What are you saying?

76
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,486
I said,

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,722
it's not like my dad's
the shark in that movie,

78
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,649
we're gonna need a bigger boat.

79
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,010
He shits and sleeps.

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,209
I swear, I thought your
father was the problem.

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,444
His nature, and towards women,
but you're two of the same.

82
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,885
You're porcupines! You're half
crazy, always looking for a fight.

83
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,125
This family

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,289
deserves the ground.

85
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,561
I got this.

86
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,410
Hey, porcupine.
Hey. Where you running?

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,323
I shouldn't have hit her.

88
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,970
Hitting is the least of it.

89
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,687
Not enough of us left
to start telling the truth.

90
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,245
Go to hell.

91
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,921
Last stand? Make a run for it?

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,321
Benjamin.

93
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,441
Floyd.

94
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,646
It's funeral day.

95
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,841
I know.

96
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,686
We waited till the dirt settled.

97
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,887
But, now I need
you to come with us.

98
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,964
It's me you should be taking.

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,684
No. You're good.

100
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,481
Floyd.

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,204
How's my boy? State
pen, awaiting trial.

102
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,969
You should visit.
Where's your brother?

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,891
Found Jesus.

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,601
Mmm.

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,484
Joined a monastery.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,211
I just bet.

107
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,606
Phone.

108
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,610
Take a message.

109
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,089
You're gonna wanna
take this one, bro.

110
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,964
The prick says he
knows where Dodd is.

111
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,250
Take the message.

112
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,881
Tell me one more time.

113
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,531
Why is Floyd Gerhardt
sitting in my interview room?

114
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,929
Sir,
Trooper Solverson and myself,

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,684
we're tired of playing cleanup.

116
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,646
Officially.

117
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,446
Thought we'd apply some
pressure to both sides.

118
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,683
Let them know all this killing
isn't going unnoticed.

119
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,480
What about this butcher?

120
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,764
We've got an APB out on both Blumquists,
Ed and Peggy. So far, nothing.

121
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,729
Could be on the run.
Could be dead.

122
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,730
I should have
checked on that girl.

123
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,526
Eliot Ness himself deputized my
daddy, ATF, during Prohibition.

124
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,407
He used to tell stories
of tommy-gun bloodbaths

125
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,323
and heads rolling in the road.

126
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,365
Never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
But here we are.

127
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,164
This thing's just
plum out of control.

128
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,846
What do you think?

129
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,682
I think I wanna
live in a world where

130
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,723
people leave
the front door unlocked.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,843
Probably, we're just
wasting our breath.

132
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,566
Okay.

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,966
You two go see the out-of-towners.
Leave the old broad to us.

134
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,882
I'm gonna smoke.

135
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,929
Ma'am, I'm Sheriff Larsson,
Rock County.

136
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,045
Had some differences with
your oldest boy yesterday.

137
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,046
How'd that go for you?

138
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,962
Let's call it a draw.

139
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,122
On account of your
Indian sucker-punched me

140
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
before I could make a showing.

141
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,762
Yeah, he does that.

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,525
Sorry to hear about Otto.

143
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,530
They shot him in his own home,

144
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,608
these Kansas City hosenscheißer.

145
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,727
Children sleeping upstairs.
Savages.

146
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,570
My wife passed last summer. We were
up in Brainerd visiting my sister.

147
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,445
The last thing she said to me,
"Do you smell toast?"

148
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,849
Different roads.
Same destination.

149
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,081
I suppose.

150
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,049
But the question is,
for you I mean,

151
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,451
how far does it go?

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,286
Husband dead,
plus your youngest.

153
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,966
Grandson in jail. And now,
Dodd's missing, we hear.

154
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,041
Old timers had it worse.

155
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,808
Used to be 10 born,
two survived.

156
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,407
Consumption, scalpings,
smallpox, wolves.

157
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,964
Well, it's a question of what
you can live with, I suppose.

158
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,280
How many ghosts.

159
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,647
I shot a man through the teeth
in Vichy France.

160
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,961
I still see his face
every night before bed.

161
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,531
Our back is to the wall.

162
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,081
You see that, yeah?

163
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,403
Yeah, except I'm the guy in the
next state who got shanghaied,

164
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,562
and your sons are the ones
that took the drive.

165
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,404
The Butcher of
Luverne killed my boy!

166
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,208
On orders from Kansas City.

167
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,966
I've known Ed Blumquist
since short pants.

168
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,726
If he's working for the Kansas
City mob, I'll cut off my toe.

169
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,242
What's it they call those Russians?
"Sleeper agents?"

170
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,370
I'm saying, you think you know
someone, but what do you know, really?

171
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,568
I even had a kid in
here the other day,

172
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,686
stabbed his parents
to death in their sleep.

173
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,044
When I asked him why,
he couldn't say.

174
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,129
Just come over him
all of a sudden.

175
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,881
Stories used to be
simpler, that's for sure.

176
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,201
This, then that.

177
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,361
And now, I don't know where
it starts or how it ends.

178
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,371
I truly don't.

179
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,450
Without being simplistic,

180
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,888
this thing's over
when you say it's over.

181
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,001
No. They won't stop. My boys.

182
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,407
They've lost too much.
They're too proud.

183
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,242
Well, okay, then.
How about you help us out?

184
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,843
You know these
Kansas City fellas.

185
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,524
Point us in
the right direction there.

186
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,246
You know,
weaknesses, indiscretions.

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,401
Give us something actionable,
and maybe,

188
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,247
we make this whole northern
expansion unpalatable.

189
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,081
Snitch.

190
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,920
Well,

191
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,330
you said yourself,

192
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,849
hard to be simple
in times of complication.

193
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,804
The sundown shinin' in

194
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,449
I found my mind

195
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,603
In a brown paper bag within

196
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,084
I tripped on a cloud
and fell eight miles high

197
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,240
I tore my mind on a jagged sky

198
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,369
I just dropped in to see what...

199
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,124
Son of a bitch.

200
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,367
Argh! You son of a bitch.

201
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,767
Yes, sir. Maybe "under
control" was the wrong phrase,

202
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,766
given what's happened.

203
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,684
You said,
when they killed Bulo, you said

204
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,650
this Gerhardt outfit
was a stuffed shirt.

205
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,561
Now I'm standing here
with blood on my socks?

206
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,927
I can handle it.

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,001
The hell, you say.

208
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,083
Braverman stood for you.

209
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,643
Said, "He's not like the other darkies.
This one's smart. Capable."

210
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,570
Sir... But that is
not what I'm seeing.

211
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,610
And I appreciate
the opportunity, sir,

212
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,405
believing as I do,
like the good Dr. King said,

213
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,605
"A man should be judged on
the content of his character,

214
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,806
"not the color of his skin."

215
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,408
Yeah, he's dead. You're gonna
need a different quote.

216
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,929
I can break this family.
Two weeks.

217
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,847
You got two days, then I'm
sending The Undertaker.

218
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,888
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

219
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,729
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,651
"Freedom, that terrible word inscribed
upon the chariot in the storm."

221
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,566
What?

222
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,161
You want me to repeat it?

223
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,169
Is that a quote? Maybe.

224
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,005
What do you want, little girl?

225
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,846
You were supposed to kill my
dad, not the old cripple.

226
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,366
What's the difference?

227
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,441
What?

228
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,289
To quote Louis XVI,

229
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,811
"Est-ce une révolte?"

230
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,168
"Non, Sire,
c'est une révolution."

231
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,530
The Duke of La Rochefoucauld.

232
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,003
Are we gonna talk or are you just
gonna quote the thesaurus at me?

233
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,607
I mean, if the goal is to
kill those who oppress you,

234
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,566
what does it
matter who goes first?

235
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,291
Because, I said...

236
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,771
Now, ironically,

237
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,851
in astronomy, the word
"revolution" means

238
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,249
a celestial object
that comes full circle.

239
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,961
Did you know that?

240
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,086
Which, if you think about it,
is pretty funny,

241
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,441
considering here on Earth,
it means change.

242
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,121
You're nuts.

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,726
I'm talking about a promise.

244
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,841
You could have killed me, shooting
up the house. Or Grandma.

245
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,407
Argh!

246
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,481
Unless...

247
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,922
Would you say you're her favorite?
Who?

248
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,525
The materfamilias.

249
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,244
In my experience,

250
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,962
the first-born
granddaughter, well,

251
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,728
she's always
the shine on the apple.

252
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,602
Oh, God.

253
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,841
Help!

254
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,207
Wow.

255
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,329
You okay there, miss?

256
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,770
I am now.

257
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,165
Walk her out, huh?

258
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,201
What about you?

259
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,691
I'm not saying don't come back.

260
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,086
I'm a big girl.

261
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,287
You don't have to nursemaid me.

262
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,404
Floyd know you're here?

263
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,686
Yeah.

264
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,082
Yeah, I've seen you around.
Up at the compound.

265
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,801
Seen me?

266
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,770
Or watched me?

267
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,046
I'm aware, I'm saying, that
the last place you should be

268
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,969
is in a hotel room
with those fellas,

269
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,929
especially given
what's happening.

270
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,446
You won't tell though,

271
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,327
will you?

272
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,963
I don't have to.

273
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,244
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

274
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,241
Oh.

275
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,051
If I'm going to the
noose, I'm going.

276
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,807
But I'm done lying down for men.

277
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,881
Oh.

278
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,481
Hey.

279
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,001
I uh...

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,001
I just...

281
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,243
I was out of weed,

282
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,802
so I bought
a dime bag from Packy?

283
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,690
You know with the uh...

284
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,443
Not safe around here for us.

285
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,607
Yeah?

286
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,250
Wow.

287
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,606
No one tells me nothing.

288
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,405
But I'll...

289
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,211
Look, I can score
weed at other places.

290
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,089
Thanks for the, uh...

291
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,242
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

292
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,325
Got my car.

293
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,049
Ricky'll drive it back.

294
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,370
You two have fun, huh?

295
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,728
Seatbelt on.

296
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,046
So,

297
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,886
is this a conversation about how it's
time for me to pack up and go home?

298
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,961
No.

299
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,405
Don't have to go home.

300
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,685
It's a big country.

301
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,805
Just maybe don't be here.

302
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,201
Are you familiar with the
phrase "manifest destiny"?

303
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,081
Yeah, but see, here's the thing.

304
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,367
I own two pairs of shoes.

305
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,966
A summer pair
and one for winter.

306
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,565
We're not meant to have
more than we can handle,

307
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,650
is what I mean.

308
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,283
So, this need for conquest,
you know,

309
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,647
trying to own things that
aren't meant to be owned...

310
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,960
Like people?

311
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,130
That's an example.

312
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,930
But also places.

313
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,648
Believing we can tame things.

314
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,328
That's a problem, right?

315
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,204
Not a solution.

316
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,648
You're saying
capitalism is a problem?

317
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,166
No.

318
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,767
Greed.

319
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,163
Making this
thing all or nothing.

320
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,322
What happened to you?
What happened? Mmm?

321
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,207
What happened? Let's
just get this over with.

322
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,247
So, you got a response
to my "all-or-nothing" line?

323
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,962
Sometimes...

324
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,690
There's a man.

325
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,603
What? What man?

326
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,524
Just a man, works in a factory.

327
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,329
One day the boss
gets it in his mind

328
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,249
that this man is
stealing from him.

329
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,005
So, every night at the gate,

330
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,043
the guards search
his wheelbarrow.

331
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,042
But they never find anything.

332
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,485
Pat him down.

333
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,766
Oh, they do that.

334
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,365
Strip him naked.

335
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
Nothing.

336
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,167
So, he's not stealing.

337
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,251
Of course he is.

338
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,840
Wheelbarrows.

339
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,884
Thank you. That's right.
He's stealing wheelbarrows.

340
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,809
What?

341
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,530
My point is,

342
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,121
sometimes the answer
is so obvious,

343
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,209
you can't see it 'cause
you're looking too hard.

344
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,567
See, we can't leave
because we're the future,

345
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,405
and they're the past.

346
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,969
The past can no more
become the future

347
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,883
than the future
can become the past.

348
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,251
Okay.

349
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,965
We said our piece.

350
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,725
Just don't be offended next time

351
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,929
if I don't say
"hello" before I shoot.

352
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,005
Jeez... Huh?

353
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,162
Karl Weathers! That is a good
way to get yourself shot.

354
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,768
Your lesser half gave us a key.

355
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,884
Asked us to look out for you and
the little one while he's gone.

356
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,567
Do I strike you as someone
who needs looking after?

357
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,011
You do not.

358
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,004
But he asked. So here we are.

359
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,005
I'll sleep on the sofa. Sonny's
already called dibs on the floor.

360
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,646
Wait, did what?

361
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,610
I'd give you the sofa,
see, except for my back.

362
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,681
What's the matter
with your back?

363
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,808
It hurts when I
sleep on the floor.

364
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,082
Eggs are done, pancakes
are warming in the oven.

365
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,367
You can fight me on
are-we-gonna-stay-the-night,

366
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,442
or you and the kid
could grab a plate,

367
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,366
and see why they call me
the Breakfast King of Loyola.

368
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,968
Any word from Grandma?

369
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,524
I saw they took her. The police.

370
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,166
She's tough, though.
It's not like they'd...

371
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,283
And like I said, I was just...

372
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,410
You know, I...

373
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,086
Dodd told everybody on our
side not to sell to me.

374
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,847
Weed, you know. And so...

375
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,767
I mean, sometimes a girl just
wants to bust a nut, you know?

376
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,443
How come you don't
ask about Charlie?

377
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,851
What?

378
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,288
You ask about Floyd and your
dad, but not about Charlie.

379
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,368
Well, I mean,
yeah, sure, how's he...

380
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,364
State pen, waiting for trial.

381
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,011
Well, we should, I mean, visit.

382
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,287
Except, maybe Dodd...

383
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,805
Dad.

384
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,601
What?

385
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,487
His name's not Dodd
to you. It's Dad.

386
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,130
Bullshit.

387
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,803
After everything he did?

388
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,128
That you've seen him do to me,

389
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,410
which you don't even wanna
think about what he does...

390
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,687
Not defending him.
...If you're not around.

391
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,888
Just telling you
what he is to you.

392
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,009
What's he to you?

393
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,245
Where are we going?

394
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,811
Come.

395
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,166
No.

396
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,565
That's not...

397
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,809
Come.

398
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,882
You're scaring me.

399
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,927
Stop.

400
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,650
He took my boy.

401
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,401
What?

402
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,289
Used his snake
tongue and took him.

403
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,923
Walked him right out the door.

404
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,445
That's what your dad is to me.

405
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,608
Look, I didn't...

406
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,443
It wasn't against you.

407
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,965
What I did...

408
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,963
I didn't mean for...

409
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,761
Doesn't matter what you mean.
It's what you do.

410
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,203
Sleeping with the enemy.

411
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,731
In France, after the Second War,

412
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,291
they shaved a lady's head
for bedding the Germans,

413
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,842
then they ran her outta town.

414
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,611
Or worse.

415
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,881
I can help.

416
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,685
They trust me.

417
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,126
I could...

418
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,961
I don't know,
I could give them information.

419
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,123
Fake information,
and you could...

420
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,201
Not our way.

421
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,771
Yeah, but...

422
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,201
I mean, they're...

423
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,964
How many dead now?

424
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,490
They're kicking our ass.

425
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,805
That's on you.

426
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,362
Your uncle,
your own grandfather.

427
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,927
That's you.

428
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
No.

429
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,891
You, don't do that.

430
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,210
Put this on me.

431
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,167
Grandma wanted to negotiate,
but Dodd...

432
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,201
Dad wouldn't let her.

433
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,200
He did this.

434
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,641
He made it war.
He's a snake, like you said.

435
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,690
A rat. He took Charlie, not me.

436
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,724
I was just...
I'm the victim here.

437
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,129
What was I supposed to do?

438
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,565
Kneel down now.

439
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,841
Please.

440
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,251
Please.

441
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,165
It's not...

442
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,610
We're family.

443
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,602
None of us are family anymore.

444
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,406
Please!

445
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,606
Please!

446
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,008
Please. Please, just...

447
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,451
Banish me.

448
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,123
Like you said, shave my head.

449
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,849
Run me out of... I'll go,
I'll go away and never...

450
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,965
You don't have to...

451
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,685
Hush now.

452
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,448
It's already done.

453
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,004
Oh, Danny Boy

454
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,650
The pipes, the pipes are calling

455
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,768
From glen to glen

456
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,847
And down the mountain side

457
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,331
The summer's gone

458
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,164
And all the roses falling

459
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,767
it's you, it's you must go

460
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,967
And I must bide

461
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,442
But come ye back

462
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,170
When summer's in the meadow

463
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,483
Or when the valley's

464
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:48,091
Hushed and white with snow

465
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,764
And I'll be here

466
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,767
In sunshine

467
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,970
Or in shadow

468
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:13,089
Oh, Danny boy

469
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,769
I love you so

470
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,524
Guy called for you again.

471
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,011
What guy?

472
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,765
Says he knows Dodd, where he is.

473
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,365
What did you say?

474
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,891
I told him you were out.

475
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,561
Argh!

476
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,041
Did the men hear? They know?

477
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,647
No.

478
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,564
Shit, man. I don't say
nothing unless you tell me.

479
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,970
There's no Dodd,
you hear? Not anymore.

480
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,531
He calls back,
this guy, you tell him

481
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,166
to sell that
shit someplace else.

482
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,402
We got all the crazy
we can handle.

483
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,964
Kind of cold, don't you think?

484
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,331
What?

485
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,925
Nothing.

486
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,844
Family business.

487
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,850
Not my place.

488
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,523
People think it's morbid,
but I think it's beautiful.

489
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,923
I got it.

490
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,606
Solversons.

491
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,920
Yeah, it's me.

492
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,524
Still breathing?

493
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,921
Thank God.

494
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,769
The boys there?

495
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,684
Do you mean
the King of Breakfast?

496
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,241
Huh?

497
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
I don't need
looking after, you know.

498
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,570
How long we've been together?

499
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,370
Well, it's all hands
on deck, hon.

500
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,968
You don't know how
bad it is out there.

501
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,769
Nope, tell me.

502
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,490
Well, I'm telling you.

503
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,406
Is Karl drinking?

504
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,484
Karl, can you read
me another story?

505
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,642
Not unless beer counts.

506
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,689
How's Molly?

507
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,966
Short.

508
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,803
And Noreen? She still there?

509
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,245
Yeah, she's good.

510
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,370
Molly likes her,

511
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,929
and she's helping.

512
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,481
And you? You feel okay?

513
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,848
Better than some.
Worse than others.

514
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,331
Well, can you rest?

515
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,761
How am I supposed to rest? You keep
telling me how bad things are.

516
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,764
Ask Karl about
John McCain's thumbscrews.

517
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,604
What?

518
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,489
He said to tell you

519
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,369
that if John
McCain could survive

520
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,209
five years in Viet
Cong thumbscrews,

521
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,243
you could beat cancer.

522
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,969
Well, yeah, I don't know about that...
My daughter?

523
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,771
But I'm trying.

524
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,601
Your dad says hi.

525
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,081
Say hi back.

526
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,561
Yeah, tell her
don't forget to feed my cats.

527
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,849
He said to tell you...
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

528
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,966
Come home soon.

529
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,406
Okay?

530
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,801
I will.

531
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,810
Everything okay?

532
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,571
Oh, yeah.

533
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,641
Well, looks like
Floyd's gonna flip.

534
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,484
Yeah? Yeah, took some doing,

535
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,721
but we convinced her

536
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,122
the only way this thing was
gonna end up in the win column,

537
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,851
was if she puts us in the game.

538
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,281
Hmm.

539
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,324
Okay, first, I want...

540
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,402
I want it on the record that
this is a road of last resort.

541
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,131
My husband...

542
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,086
Second,

543
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,811
I need assurances that
none of my children,

544
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,451
or my grandchildren are in
line for any repercussions.

545
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,521
This is my choice.

546
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,202
My war. They're just
doing what they're told.

547
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,968
Capital crimes excluded.

548
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,565
What's that supposed to mean?

549
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,323
Murder in the first
and the like.

550
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,806
What's the point of the damn
deal if it doesn't cover murder?

551
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,087
From this point forth,
he's saying.

552
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,486
New crimes.

553
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,329
Now, time you tell
us what you know.

554
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,201
Don't you look at
me with those eyes.

555
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,724
None of you are mothers.

556
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,401
Kansas City

557
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,251
runs most of their dope through
an outfit called Legit Truckin'

558
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,084
out of Cincinnati.

559
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,647
My information is they hide it
in the tires.

560
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,411
Here in town, they store their
gak in two different places.

561
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,324
There's a nail
salon on Robertson.

562
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,483
And an auto
repair shop on First.

563
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,251
And check the air pump inside.

564
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,084
Also, I hear they got weapons

565
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,407
stashed on the roof.

566
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,570
Hello.

567
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,569
The Undertaker's coming.

568
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,125
You're done.

569
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,406
Okay? Yeah.

570
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,082
Get word to Hanzee.
Tell him to come in.

571
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,810
And find Dodd.

572
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,847
How?

573
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,002
Don't care how.
War's almost won.

574
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,202
Gotta finish them
while they're reeling.

575
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,530
What do you think?

576
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,042
I think we just chose a side.

577
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,845
Indian shot two troopers
in South Dakota.

578
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,331
What? What Indian?

579
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,367
Ours.

580
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,728
Description matches the
Gerhardt's man, been missing.

581
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,528
Where? Sioux Falls.

582
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,130
Witness said the
Indian shot up a bar

583
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,282
and that he was looking
for a young couple.

584
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,801
Man of which being a redhead.

585
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,081
Peggy and Ed.

586
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,891
It's South Dakota's problem,
it sounds like.

587
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,485
That's one way
to think about it.

588
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,648
So, the Indian,
probably he got away, yeah?

589
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,001
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

590
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,402
One trooper dead,
one clinging to life.

591
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,888
Still, pursuit means
they could be close.

592
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,247
Right? Peggy and Ed?
Holed up somewhere.

593
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,367
Or on the road.

594
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,205
If we're lucky, yeah. The
troopers got road blocks set up.

595
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,205
Then there's Dodd.

596
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,487
Usually where the Indian
goes, Dodd's there.

597
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,891
Witness just saw the Indian.

598
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,287
Except remember,

599
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,966
we just promised to give
the Gerhardts a free pass.

600
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,610
You better run it by the captain.
That's all I'm saying.

601
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,011
You're a shit cop.
You know that, right?

602
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,523
Getting promoted next month,
so how bad could it be?

603
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,405
Stay then.

604
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,687
Maybe we'll go see if
we can save the day.

605
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,649
Stop it.

606
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,810
I'm fine. I feel fine.

607
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,680
Good.

608
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,287
He worries too much.
Like this, sending you over.

609
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,727
Mmm.

610
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,881
Men.

611
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,491
Shut up.

612
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,048
He was supposed to marry
my sister, you know.

613
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,488
Lenore, the older.

614
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,686
After high school.

615
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,325
She used to say, "I'm gonna
marry that boy someday."

616
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,730
But then there was Vietnam
and he joined up,

617
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,769
and she never was very good at waiting.
So he got me.

618
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,810
The dud.

619
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,360
Listen, if I was building
an ark and they said,

620
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,444
"You can only take two people,
man and wife,"

621
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,969
I'd take him and you
over him and her any day.

622
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,164
You'll look after them.

623
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,491
Right?

624
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,208
My dad'll help, but he'll need
looking after too, before too long.

625
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,449
You got the new pills.

626
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,206
Xanadu.

627
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,520
No.

628
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,485
They gave me the sugar ones.

629
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,005
I'm pretty sure.

630
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,002
Tell him if he needs to get
married again, it's okay.

631
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,967
Just not Rhonda Knutson.

632
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,724
Her eyes are too small or too
close together or something.

633
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,645
It's weird.

634
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,526
Listen, if John McCain could...

635
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,971
Karl Weathers.

636
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,008
Don't you be silly now.

637
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,285
John McCain was a fighter pilot.

638
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,129
I live in a starter
house in Minnesota

639
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,129
and dream of
having chickens one day.

640
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,481
Just make sure

641
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,044
he feeds her more than jerky.

642
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,964
And stop drinking,
Mr. King of Breakfast.

643
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,451
It'll kill you.

644
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,170
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

645
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,485
Snowball?

646
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,086
Snowball?

647
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,245
Snowball?

648
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,850
Tell Simone to come see me. I
wanna apologize for yesterday.

649
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,287
She left in a hurry
when you were took.

650
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,285
Don't think she's back yet.

651
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,046
Hey.

652
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,002
Sorry, missus, but uh...

653
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,526
What? What is it?

654
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,491
It's for your son, ma'am.
Supposed to talk to him directly.

655
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,851
It's okay. We'll go
into the barn.

656
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,691
No. No secrets here.

657
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,245
Well, what is it, kid?
Spit it out.

658
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,487
Your Indian, he's on the phone.

659
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,205
Hanzee. Says he found Dodd.

660
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,844
I'm sorry.

661
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,087
O, Death

662
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,166
O, Death

663
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,606
Won't you spare me
over till another year

664
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,242
Undertaker's on his way up.

665
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,846
Well, what is this
that I can't see

666
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,642
With ice cold hands
takin' hold of me

667
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,687
Well, I am death, none can excel

668
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,685
I'll open the door
to heaven or hell

669
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,850
Whoa, death someone would pray

670
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,363
Could you wait to
call me another day

671
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,487
The children prayed,
the preacher preached

672
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,963
Time and mercy
is out of your reach

673
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,526
I'll fix your feet
till you can't walk

674
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,367
I'll lock your jaw
till you can't talk

675
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,525
I'll close your eyes
so you can't see

676
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,128
This very hour,
come and go with me

677
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,409
I am death
I come to take the soul

678
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,008
Leave the body and leave it cold

679
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,320
Where's this eggplant who
can't stop shitting the bed?

680
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,681
Gentlemen.

681
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,249
Bag them and drop
them in the woods.

682
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,649
We tell the boss
the Gerhardts got them.

683
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,886
Hello?

684
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,161
Mike Milligan?

685
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,401
Yes.

686
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,850
Today's your lucky day.

687
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,650
I've got Dodd Gerhardt in the
trunk of my car. You want him?
