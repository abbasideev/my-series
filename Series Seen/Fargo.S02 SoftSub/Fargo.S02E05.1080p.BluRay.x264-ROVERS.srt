1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,525
Erstwhile on Fargo...

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,568
We need to find Rye,
bring him home.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,766
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,126
He known to you?

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,043
Ed? Yeah. He's a butcher.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,801
I ran over him! Hit and run!

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,441
His name was Rye Gerhardt and
his family hurts people for money.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,929
If you did something, you
made a mistake, you panicked,

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,123
maybe covered it up,
now's the time to say.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,127
But that window's closing
and you may already be dead.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,851
We're asking you to leave.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,607
Management says acquire the
territory, we acquire it.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,850
Whether that's cash down or
sending bodies to the morgue,

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,649
that's up to the krauts.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,044
Joe Bulo says hi.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,645
Your counter has been rejected.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,649
And now we're lowering our
price by two million.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,525
Anything other than
unconditional surrender

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,207
and we'll wipe every last Gerhardt
off the face of the earth.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,642
My father was a salesman.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,845
Ladies' shoes.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,001
It's fair to say, during the
Depression, that he struggled.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,324
Like a lot of people on the
Rock River, in Dixon, Illinois.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,570
But I've never been one
to focus on life's downs.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,602
I was a lifeguard
in high school.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,365
And where some saw a drowning
man, I saw a life to save.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,288
Which I did 77 times
in five years.

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,442
They put up a plaque
after I became governor.

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,290
Well, I'd have to say I'm prouder
of that than just about anything.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,127
I'm gonna call you Chief
Wigwam, you bring that thing.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,049
Any man can fire a gun.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,883
The longbow is an art.

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,086
Everythin' okay?

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,242
Just a little housekeeping.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,209
Let's kill ourselves some deer.

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,807
My friends, we have in
our lifetime fought harder,

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,325
paid a higher price for freedom,

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,607
and done more to advance
the dignity of man

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,445
than any people who
ever lived on this earth.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,281
But if you look around, you may not
see many signs of that dignity.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,526
Crime is up, jobs are scarce.

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,206
You have to stand in a line
just to fill up your car.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,407
How?

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,485
He was run down in the street, then
finished off at a second location.

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,085
You're sure?

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,927
Who?

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,161
Butcher.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,127
A butcher?

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,531
Down in Luverne.

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Like the law said, Rye followed
the judge, shot up the place.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,490
Got killed after.

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,761
By a butcher?

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,365
That's his name.

54
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,091
Butcher of Luverne.

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,524
That's what they call him.

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,001
He's a contract man out of...

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,409
Out of Kansas City.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,250
I wanna hear it from him.

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,320
Kid was marked.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,890
Probably the day he left.

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,488
Butcher ambushed
him after the judge.

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,643
Tried to grab him, probably.

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,484
He got in some licks.

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,125
Things went downhill.

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,201
Why?

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,408
Ma, it's war. You said yourself.
They're jackals.

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,086
Came here talkin'
about a settlement.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,447
Meanwhile the kid
is already dead.

69
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,285
I'm askin' him.

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,767
He's a bargaining
chip, yeah? Rye?

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,326
Kansas City thinks
if they grab him up,

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,726
then come to you
with that leverage,

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,245
you'll sell for sure.

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,931
Instead, they kill him,
then panic, cover it up,

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,402
knowin' once you find out,
sale's dead, no question.

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,486
See?

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,525
The citizens of this great
nation want leadership, yes,

78
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,726
but not a man on a white horse
demanding obedience to his commands.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,087
They want someone who believes they
can begin the world over again.

80
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,323
I'm sayin' the age of the
local mom and pop is over.

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,283
And what comes next,
Commissioner,

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,803
the era of big business is gonna
make a lot of people very rich.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,211
I like the sound of that.

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,609
And you're sayin' you can deliver
leaders on the state and local level?

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,208
Joe, there's not
a politician in this state

86
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,850
wouldn't take my call
in the middle of dinner.

87
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,887
Well, then you and me, we're
really gonna be pals.

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,680
A leader who will unleash
their great strength

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,610
and remove the roadblocks
government has put in their way.

90
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,170
Watch and learn, Joe.

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,282
I believe this nation hungers
for a spiritual revival.

92
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,801
Watch and learn.

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,526
What the... Move!

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,601
Gerhardts!

95
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,646
Gerhardts!

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,403
That we, all of us, hunger
to once again see honor

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,608
placed above
political expediency.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,322
To see government, once again
the protector of liberties,

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,483
not the distributor
of gifts and privilege.

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,689
Government should uphold and not
undermine those institutions

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,968
which are custodians
of the very values

102
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,162
upon which civilization
is founded,

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,606
religion, education,
and above all, family.

104
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,881
Weak.

105
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,766
We who are
privileged to be Americans

106
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,651
have had a rendezvous with
destiny since the moment in 1630

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,803
when John Winthrop, standing
on the deck of the tiny Arbella

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,564
off the coast of Massachusetts,

109
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,642
told that little
band of pilgrims,

110
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,088
"We shall be as
a city upon a hill."

111
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,928
A troubled and afflicted
mankind looks to us,

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,562
pleading for us to keep
our rendezvous with destiny,

113
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,006
that we will uphold the
principles of self-reliance,

114
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,845
self-discipline, morality,

115
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,845
and above all, responsible
liberty for every individual.

116
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,764
That we will become that
shining city on a hill.

117
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,404
My friends, I believe
that you and I together

118
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,604
can keep this
rendezvous with destiny.

119
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,566
Thank you.

120
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,130
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,927
Everyone, thank you.

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,126
God bless you.

123
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,723
Son of a bitch is
charismatic, I'll give him that.

124
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,924
But I'm not shakin' his hand.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,081
Why not, Karl?

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,004
Because, Sonny, the man
made a movie with a monkey.

127
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,003
It wouldn't be dignified.

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,491
Well, hello. How are you?

129
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,888
I loved you in
Cattle Queen of Montana.

130
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,803
Well, thank you. Not many
people liked that film.

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,530
Hello, little girl.

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,489
Governor, I'll be escorting
your bus to the next stop.

133
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,686
So, whenever you're ready.

134
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, all right.

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,161
You got drafted?

136
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,730
Yeah, Captain called.

137
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,564
I offered we had
murders to solve, but...

138
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,688
He knows best, probably.

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,211
Said he did anyway.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,011
Anyway, just got to take this
as far as the state line.

141
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,844
So, be home by dark. Okay.

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,001
Bye.

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,440
Bye.

144
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,730
If you get the chance, ask him if it's
true that Joan Crawford had crabs.

145
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,762
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

146
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,325
We got 'em.

147
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,041
Bulo too?

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,246
Oh, yeah.

149
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,201
Milligan?

150
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,409
No, he wasn't there.

151
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,331
You can bet they're gonna
come back at us hard.

152
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,569
I thought they'd negotiate.

153
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,881
That's the feminine side, Mom.

154
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,886
It was always gonna be war,
them knowing Rye was dead.

155
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,125
Killin' him, I mean.

156
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,802
I want this Butcher dead.

157
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,685
In Luverne.

158
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,251
No mercy.

159
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,564
I'm sending Virgil.

160
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,241
Hon.

161
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,441
Hon?

162
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,448
Sorry, are we out of coffee?

163
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,327
What?

164
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,805
Did you...

165
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,966
You weren't in bed, so I...

166
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,883
I know, I was just thinkin'...

167
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,961
What?

168
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,327
What we should take.

169
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,045
Take where?

170
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,291
When we go?

171
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,604
Where are we goin'?

172
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,085
To California.

173
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,730
What are you...

174
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,246
What are you talkin'...
When we run, I mean.

175
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,243
Ya heard what Lou said.

176
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,083
I mean, if we've
just messed things...

177
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,925
If I've just messed
things up from the start?

178
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,762
If this is still not over?

179
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,202
Just the tail of the snake.

180
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,003
What are you sayin'?

181
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,406
I mean, what was he even doin' in the
road, for shit sake? That fella.

182
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,201
All those dead people,
and he had a car,

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,846
so why was he
standin' in the road?

184
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,445
I don't know.

185
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,327
But...

186
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,890
Constance saw.

187
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,326
Saw what?

188
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,651
The car...

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,282
After you cleaned it, but
before we crashed it again.

190
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,327
She knows about the accident.

191
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,242
She drove me home the night I...

192
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,524
The night you got rid of the...

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,680
And had to use the bathroom.

194
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,450
I was gonna walk her right out,

195
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,206
but then I heard music
comin' from the garage...

196
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,007
And she came up
behind me and saw.

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,646
I mean, what did
she say, though?

198
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,001
I...

199
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,885
I don't think she'll tell, but how
can we know for sure, you know?

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,085
And plus now with the law enforcement
askin' questions, suspectin'.

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,527
And these ghouls on
the come, Lou said.

202
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,048
Hon, we can't stay here.

203
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,641
No.

204
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,281
Hon.

205
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,407
No.

206
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,526
You said... We agreed.

207
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,762
Clean it up and
everything'd be...

208
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,841
I know, hon...

209
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,921
No.

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,204
We did this for a reason, Peg.

211
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,850
For the shop and the kids.

212
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,810
For a reason, so we could stay.
That's the only... That's...

213
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,803
Hon, you got to be realistic.

214
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,847
No. No!

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,604
I... We're stayin'.

216
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,091
That was...

217
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,964
Whatever comes, we'll deal with
it, or it'll deal with us.

218
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,330
But I'm buyin' the shop
and we're startin' a family.

219
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,801
But how?

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,167
It's too late to get the
money back for the course.

221
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,647
And you said Bud had
to have it by Friday.

222
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,291
We'll figure it out.
That's what people do.

223
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,690
They figure things out,
stay together, make it work.

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,126
I can help.

225
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,645
Do your chores, kid.

226
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,722
I'm serious. Playtime's over.

227
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,649
I can do it. You saw.

228
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,849
Luverne, Minnesota.

229
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,411
Ed Blumquist.

230
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,562
He's posin' as the town butcher.

231
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,760
This is baloney.

232
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,921
I'm not just some crippled kid

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,081
can't shoot straight.
Ask your dad.

234
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,764
If he says you can
go, you can go.

235
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,891
It should be us.

236
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,321
A Gerhardt.

237
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,762
He killed a Gerhardt,
so it should be one of us.

238
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,163
A real boss would know that.

239
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,204
You're takin' the kid.

240
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,526
You're the boss.

241
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,886
You walk him in.

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,809
He pulls the trigger.

243
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,763
Anything goes wrong, you
fix it, you understand?

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,968
Where do you think you're goin'?
Got an errand.

245
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,201
Send one of the boys.

246
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,611
I can run my own errand.

247
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,170
It's not safe.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,729
God damn it!

249
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,167
Some people are made of plastic

250
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,564
And you know some people
are made of wood

251
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,048
Some people have
hearts of stone Whoa!

252
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,766
Some people are up to no good

253
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,169
But, baby, I'm for real

254
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,126
I'm as real as real can get

255
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,729
if what you're looking
for is real loving

256
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,691
Then what you see
is what you get

257
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,970
Ha! What you see

258
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,610
What you see

259
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,770
ls what you get

260
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,691
Yeah?

261
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,281
And?

262
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,886
Is what you get

263
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,965
I said what you see
is what you get

264
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,048
It's getting ugly out there.

265
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,646
You okay?

266
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,447
My mother could find the cloud
in every silver lining.

267
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,485
That's cute.

268
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,963
Mine smiles all the
time, like some ghoul.

269
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,649
I think it's 'cause Dad hits
her when she looks sad.

270
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,249
I see Thing One.
Where's Thing Two?

271
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,401
Dead.

272
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,204
Your Indian killed him.

273
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,409
Killed a lot of people.

274
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,161
I didn't know that
was happening.

275
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,970
Nobody told me.

276
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,250
You believe me.

277
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,321
Right?

278
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,362
What are we in your mind?

279
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,562
Romeo and Juliet?

280
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,921
No.

281
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,845
I don't know.

282
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,207
She was a true gloom, my mother.

283
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,288
We used to eat in the dark.

284
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,209
For a laugh, I wrote
on her tombstone,

285
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,250
"Here lies Barbara Milligan,
happy till the end."

286
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,282
Me, on the other hand,
I'm an optimist.

287
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,250
So, when I see this...

288
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,841
Oh.

289
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,121
I don't think
the sky is falling.

290
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,003
I think, that, sir, is the
sound of opportunity knocking.

291
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,770
Not so much my young friend.

292
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,285
It's not my fault.

293
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,761
They had a meetin' without me.

294
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,805
I would've said.

295
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,726
If you want me to
take you seriously,

296
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,446
you have to be a serious person.

297
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,130
Have a beer, do a line,

298
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,925
blow your load,

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,650
all that's fine,

300
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,723
but it's not the point.

301
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,324
What's the point?

302
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,327
I wanna know what they're
gonna do before they do it.

303
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,005
Every time.

304
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,326
Otherwise, you can die
with the rest of 'em.

305
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,120
Okay, car 1-8, come in, over.

306
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,965
This is 1 -8. Go ahead.

307
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,884
I got Fargo PD on the
line lookin' for you.

308
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,088
Yeah, okay. Patch it through.

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,604
Hey, how's your day then?

310
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,045
Peachy. You?

311
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,203
Oh, it's a shit
sandwich up here.

312
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,606
Got 12 dead in the woods.

313
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,284
Half Gerhardt, half Kansas City,

314
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,566
plus a local zoning commissioner

315
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,244
with half his face
in the bushes.

316
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,131
Good Christ.

317
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,487
Yeah.

318
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,803
This thing's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

319
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,611
Well, on my end, we think we know
what happened to Rye Gerhardt.

320
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,281
Run over by a local beautician.

321
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,522
Got stuck in her windshield.

322
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,324
We think she and her husband panicked
and dumped the body someplace.

323
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,568
Meanwhile, we've had
visitors from both factions,

324
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,808
most likely lookin'
for revenge, so,

325
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,082
a little like the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

326
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,725
Well, my captain thinks
I should try to intervene,

327
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,451
seein' as how my
mom knows Floyd,

328
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,171
and maybe cooler heads
can prevail, et cetera,

329
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,568
which, well, you saw how well
that went over last time, huh?

330
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,964
Sounds like maybe
I should come up.

331
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,804
Wouldn't mind the company.

332
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,570
Well, I'm stuck
on this Reagan detail today.

333
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,849
So, assumin' we survive the night
here, I'll drive up first thing.

334
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,724
Thanks.

335
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,247
Okay, I'll try to keep the pot
from boilin' over in the meantime.

336
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,685
Yeah. Over.

337
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,803
No, I... Yeah,
that's... I understand.

338
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,123
It's a recession...

339
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,922
No, I appreciate it, and...

340
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,046
Okay.

341
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,926
Okay, say hi to
Aunt Velma for me.

342
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
Nothin'?

343
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,646
Personally, not sure why
you're makin' all this effort.

344
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,808
Gonna buy the shop,
be my own boss.

345
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,087
And?

346
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,562
And what? That's
the American Dream.

347
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,644
What's the point?

348
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,643
Just gonna die anyway.

349
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,686
What do you mean?

350
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,881
Camus says knowin' we're all
gonna die makes life a joke.

351
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,562
So what, you just give up?

352
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,324
You could kill yourself.

353
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,084
Get it over with.

354
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,769
Okay, that's not...

355
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,888
I mean, come on. You gotta try.

356
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,007
No.

357
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,721
You go to school, you get a
job, you start a family.

358
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,166
Die. That's...

359
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,811
Would you please
stop sayin' that?

360
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,884
I'm gonna live
a long, long life.

361
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,730
My grandpa was 96.

362
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,888
At which point he did what?

363
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,201
Died.

364
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,486
Noreen.

365
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,247
Well, okay, I'm goin'
to go in the back now,

366
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,847
away from this nonsense.

367
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,127
Would you please let
me know if Bud's back?

368
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,406
I will.

369
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,810
Unless I'm dead.

370
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,688
What are you waitin' for?

371
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,321
You want that I should
carry you over there?

372
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,484
No, I was just...

373
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,924
Well, do I, you know, shoot
him in the head or in...

374
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,324
Don't overthink it.

375
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,249
Just point and shoot.

376
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,848
If he keeps movin',
shoot him again.

377
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,160
Simple.

378
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,361
Kid.

379
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,531
One more thing.

380
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,565
No witnesses.

381
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,808
Oh. Sorry. Didn't hear ya.

382
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,005
What kind of meat do you want?

383
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,929
We got pig meat,
cow meat, chicken meat.

384
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,842
Bud won't let us sell fish, even
though Jesus says eat it on Fridays.

385
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,326
The...

386
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,849
Lookin' for the butcher.

387
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,285
Blumquist.

388
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,206
Yeah, he's not the butcher.

389
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,722
More the assistant butcher.

390
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,091
Though, that's gonna
change, I think.

391
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,764
Buyin' the place.

392
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,528
Not that you need to...

393
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,085
He's in the back. I'll buzz him for you.

394
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,723
Oh, hey, I read that.

395
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,846
Oh, yeah?

396
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,251
Last year.

397
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,810
It's pretty depressin'.

398
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,200
Really?

399
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,806
See, I think it's beautiful.

400
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,169
But then everyone always says,
"Noreen, you're morose."

401
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,322
Halloween is my
favorite holiday.

402
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,764
I like Easter.

403
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,967
'Course.

404
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,724
The resurrection.

405
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,008
It's like why
everyone loves Rocky,

406
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,322
even though it's
a boxin' picture.

407
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,250
The comeback.

408
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,411
Except, he loses in the end.

409
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,128
Well, now you ruined it.

410
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,441
Sorry.

411
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,731
Just kiddin'.

412
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,811
Oh, here's Ed now.

413
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,571
Sorry, was just in
the middle of a hog.

414
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,128
So, what can I do you for?

415
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,890
Let's find each other tonight

416
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,681
Everything will be all right

417
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,481
Don't hesitate now
Let's find each other tonight

418
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
If you need some company

419
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,726
Mama, take a chance on me

420
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,651
Don't hesitate now
Let's find each other tonight

421
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,326
You don't wanna be
like those other dreamers

422
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,725
That dream about love
and never love

423
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,047
You wanna be a screamer

424
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,208
So, honey, I'm hopin'
Honey, I'm hopin'

425
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,767
If you need some company

426
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,406
Mama, take a chance on me

427
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,405
Don't hesitate now Let's
find each other tonight

428
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,010
Hey ya, Peggy.

429
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,480
I just...

430
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,126
I'm here for my car.

431
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,362
Yeah, so she's all fixed,
front and back.

432
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,891
Put a new windshield on her.

433
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,485
She's a sweet car, really.

434
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,607
Okay.

435
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,206
So, is that gonna be cash or...

436
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,924
I wrote out a check.

437
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,642
Maybe don't cash it 'til the
end of the week though, huh?

438
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,687
Payday.

439
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,091
Oh, yeah, that's no problem.

440
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,441
You goin' somewhere?

441
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,124
Well, I guess so.

442
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,608
You know, for the best.

443
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,771
Best what?

444
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,601
Just...

445
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,648
Wait till the end of the month
to cash that check, okay?

446
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,721
Yeah, sure thing.

447
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,040
You take care.

448
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,489
You wanna buy my car?

449
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,725
What do you mean?

450
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,280
Well, you said it was sweet,

451
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,287
and, you know, we
gotta buy the shop?

452
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,124
The butcher shop?

453
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,844
So, we could use the money.

454
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,725
What about your trip?

455
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,204
Decided not to go.

456
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,646
Just now?

457
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,531
Moments ago.

458
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,523
Well, I couldn't give you
any more than $700 for her.

459
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,081
Okay.

460
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,131
Are you sure?
It's worth at least 14.

461
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,921
Yeah, well, seven today
is better than 14 tomorrow.

462
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,648
So can we do it now,
like, right away?

463
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,681
Wash away my
troubles Wash away my pain

464
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,890
With the rain in Shambala

465
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,327
Wash away my sorrow
Wash away my shame

466
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,564
With the rain in Shambala

467
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,166
Ooh, yeah

468
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,246
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

469
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,005
Ooh, yeah

470
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,205
How'd it go this mornin'?

471
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,322
Killed a few, lost a few.

472
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,281
But you delivered the message.

473
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,403
I want to thank you for your
service to this family.

474
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,885
Me and Mom.

475
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,408
Ever since my dad took you
in, eight, nine years old,

476
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,642
you never complained
or made demands.

477
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,649
Though it might not feel
like it all the time, to me,

478
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,688
you're part of this family.

479
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,288
Not that Dodd would
ever tell you that,

480
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,165
which I know you're mostly his
guy, but I just want you to know,

481
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,561
there's a place for you at our
table, with or without him.

482
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,849
All you gotta do is
be straight with us.

483
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,410
I am straight.

484
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,842
Well, of course. It's just...

485
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,011
We just escalated this war
on account of what you...

486
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,527
The information you
found out about Rye.

487
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,610
Mom's real upset,

488
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,809
but I have to just double-check
the veracity of...

489
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,124
Before it's too far
over the breach.

490
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,164
My daughter back?

491
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,168
What the hell are you doin'?

492
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,930
Get back to work.

493
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,690
That's my man.

494
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,084
You need to talk to him,
you talk to me first.

495
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,771
Last time I checked, everyone
here worked for one person. Ma.

496
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,804
You actually like it, huh?

497
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,008
Takin' orders from a woman.

498
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,931
Is that how it was in the
bedroom with Kathy?

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,126
Don't you talk about her.

500
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,202
She strap one on,
bend you over the bed,

501
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,288
and show you who's boss?

502
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,891
There'll be a reckoning
one day, brother.

503
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,123
All souls are called to
account for their actions.

504
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,561
In the end, we all
get what we deserve.

505
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,247
You keep tellin' yourself that.

506
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,449
The eyes of
all people are upon us

507
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,801
so that if we shall deal falsely with
our God in this work we have undertaken

508
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,611
and so cause Him to withdraw
his present help from us,

509
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,446
we shall be made a story and a
byword throughout the world.

510
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,888
A troubled and afflicted
mankind looks to us.

511
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,008
My friends, I believe
that you and I together

512
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,924
can keep this rendezvous
with destiny.

513
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,691
Thank you.

514
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,685
God bless you and
God bless America.

515
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,961
Oh!

516
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,371
Oh, that's good.

517
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,841
Been holding it
since Ortonville.

518
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,010
My wife puts this potpourri
in the bus toilet,

519
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,969
can barely breathe in there.

520
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,968
They do like their scents.

521
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,326
Where'd you serve, son?

522
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,050
Mekong Delta, swift boat patrol.
Two tours.

523
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,926
Well, I sure
appreciate your service.

524
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,241
Every generation has their time.

525
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,481
I remember back in '42, America
had just joined the war.

526
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,531
I was working on Operation
Eagle's Nest for Paramount.

527
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,285
I got dropped behind enemy lines

528
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,931
trying to rescue Jimmy
Whitmore and Laraine Day

529
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,650
from this SS commando.

530
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,051
Bob Stack was on
loan from Selznick.

531
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,201
That Nazi bastard
had us cornered.

532
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,161
We were done for,
but in the end,

533
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,446
with a little
American ingenuity,

534
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,170
we managed to...

535
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,523
No, now wait a minute. Um...

536
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,445
Come to think of it, I don't think
we made it out of that one.

537
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,851
Or did we?

538
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,409
Oh, shit, I can't remember.

539
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,051
Well, either way,
it was a fine picture.

540
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,921
Um...

541
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,647
Governor, I don't mean to...

542
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,126
What we did over
there, the war...

543
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,641
Um...

544
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,089
And now, my wife's got lymphoma.

545
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,485
Stage III.

546
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,006
And lately, the
state of things...

547
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,204
Well, sometimes, I...
Late at night...

548
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,127
I wonder if maybe the
sickness of this world,

549
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,885
if it isn't inside
my wife somehow.

550
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,485
The cancer.

551
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,721
I don't know what
I'm sayin' except,

552
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,131
do you really think we'll get
outta this mess we're in?

553
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,923
Son, there's not a
challenge on God's earth

554
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,321
that can't be overcome
by an American.

555
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,329
I truly believe that.

556
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,841
Yeah.

557
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,406
But how?

558
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,689
Mommy. Sorry.

559
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,171
Poppa's here.

560
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,606
Your dad is?

561
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,727
No.

562
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,211
No, just me.

563
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,808
Saw Molly in the window.

564
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,531
I knocked, you didn't hear?

565
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,001
No.

566
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,365
Well, got worried,
so I let myself in.

567
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,440
You feelin' okay?

568
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,801
Oh, sure.

569
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,606
Little tired.

570
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,920
Yeah, just talked to Lou,

571
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,128
probably got another two hours
on this Reagan detail.

572
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,091
So I thought, you know, I'd just
stop by and make a nuisance.

573
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,244
Are you hungry?

574
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,446
I can fix you somethin'.

575
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,806
You're sweet.

576
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,121
I was just now tryin' to decide

577
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,561
if I'm hungry or
if I wanna throw up.

578
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,242
Don't normally confuse the two.

579
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,130
Well, nausea's a side effect
of this drug they gave me.

580
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,806
Which would mean they actually
gave me the drug, and not candy.

581
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,560
There's candy?

582
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,051
Eat somethin' green
and we'll talk.

583
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,848
So we're rootin'
for nausea, then, huh?

584
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,522
Well, okay. Um...

585
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,209
I'm just all left thumbs when
it comes to this stuff...

586
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,566
You're doin' great. Dad.

587
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,688
No, I don't know about that.

588
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,925
If your mom were here,
she'd know just what to say.

589
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,001
Me?

590
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,843
I can fix the toaster.

591
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,164
Well, maybe just...

592
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,562
Do you think maybe you could
watch Molly for a bit?

593
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,801
I just don't...

594
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,646
I'm not sure if I can keep my eyes
open right now, for some reason.

595
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,886
Watch who?

596
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,007
Me.

597
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,081
Who?

598
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,281
Me.

599
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,600
Oh, what the heck.

600
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,887
Thank you, Dad.

601
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,849
Yeah, sure. You get some rest.

602
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,207
We'll just be here
eating sugar cereal

603
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,607
and playing with
my service weapon.

604
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,609
Now, what the heck is that?

605
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,091
Rhinoceros?

606
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,970
Yeah, it's Charlie.

607
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,929
I'm lookin' for Dad.

608
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,405
Well, is he...
When's he comin' back?

609
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,485
No, that's...

610
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,690
Just... Just tell him that I'm
ready for school... To go back.

611
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,326
I wanna go, like he said.

612
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,005
Okay then.

613
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,721
Ed!

614
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,847
Ed!

615
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,360
No, no!

616
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,801
Noreen.

617
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,564
Noreen, you okay?

618
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,767
You okay?

619
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,524
Come on. Come on.

620
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,444
Ed.

621
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,447
Ed.

622
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,961
Ed!

623
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,446
Ed!

624
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,849
Come on! Leave him, leave him.

625
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,604
No, no, he's still alive!

626
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,011
We've got to take him.

627
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,127
Ed. Okay.

628
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,486
Okay.

629
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,089
Call the fire truck!

630
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,210
I saved the kid.

631
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,611
Didn't I?

632
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,125
Didn't I? Yeah.

633
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,804
And he shot first?

634
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,530
Can you tell the cops that?

635
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,683
And the big guy, he came at me
and that it was self-defense?

636
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,205
Yeah? Yeah.

637
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,005
Of course.

638
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,320
But...

639
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,681
But...

640
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,126
Ed!

641
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,241
Ed!

642
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,724
Where you been?

643
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,204
I just met a friend.

644
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,001
Mmm.

645
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,448
You think you're
grown? Is that it?

646
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,401
What?

647
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,762
With your clothes and
your hair and no bra.

648
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,046
Like you know somethin'
about the world.

649
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,288
Bein' grown's got a price.

650
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,482
Kid gets a slap when he's bad.

651
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,527
When you're grown,
you get the fist.

652
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,445
Or the knife.

653
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,207
Son.

654
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,408
You let that girl alone.

655
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,370
Get upstairs now, darlin'.

656
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,883
Hon? Hon?

657
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,327
Hon, where's the luggage?
We need to pack.

658
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,447
Hon!

659
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,886
Hon, we, we...

660
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,086
Hon.

661
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,089
Yeah, we... We need...

662
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,846
I got a surprise for you.

663
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,570
That's... Okay,
but we need to...

664
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,687
No, we don't gotta go.

665
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,886
No, listen. I wanna talk to ya.

666
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,361
I've been thinkin' a lot
about what you said

667
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,050
and how I've been and... Sit.

668
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,167
Sit.

669
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,844
That... That...
No, this is important!

670
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,730
What I'm tryin' to say
is you were right.

671
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,248
I mean, we were both right,
but you also is what I'm...

672
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,243
Not just me, in other words.

673
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,290
And what you said about
the shop and the money,

674
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,283
that was... It was
selfish of me to...

675
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,850
I mean, without even askin'.

676
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,005
And also, we gotta fight,
fight for what we want.

677
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,081
Okay, but... You know.

678
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,730
And I can see that now.

679
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,569
So... Hon, we...

680
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,846
- Hon!
- Ta-da!

681
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,850
I sold the car. What car?

682
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,921
My car.

683
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,925
I went to the shop and Sonny, you
know, he said how much he loved it,

684
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,722
and so I... And I know that I
could've gotten more for it,

685
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,643
but it's enough is what matters.

686
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,881
Enough to buy the shop.

687
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,686
You, you...

688
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,125
Because you were right.

689
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,362
This was our dream, you know.

690
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,330
And so now, we can do it.

691
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,044
The shop burned down.

692
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,600
What?

693
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,921
And I killed another
fella, maybe two.

694
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,089
And Lou... Lou was right.
They came.

695
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,648
They came. The other fella
that you hit, his family?

696
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,085
They came.

697
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,850
So, this is...

698
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,281
That's great,
you know, thank you.

699
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,124
But we gotta go.

700
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,929
You need to pack.

701
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,206
Okay, okay?

702
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,884
Look at... Okay.
