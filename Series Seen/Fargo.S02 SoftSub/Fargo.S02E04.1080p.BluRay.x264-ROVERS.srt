1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,606
United States Marines
would be successful

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,364
in pushing back
North Korean troops

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,765
surging south across
the 38th parallel.

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,569
Truman offered unlimited
military aid to South Korea without seeking

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,166
an official declaration
of war from Congress.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,648
The world, Mr.
Lawrence, is now experiencing

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,524
strange astronomical phenomena.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,730
Reports have come
in from all over

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,325
the globe of
inexplicable objects...

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,289
Gotta check ya, Otto.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,641
Surely, you're not telling
me a scientist like yourself

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,085
believes such nonsense.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,322
No, I'm not telling you that.

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,321
Dodd.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,089
Like the heads of Easter Island.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,207
What?

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,891
Not a sound.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,084
Cheech says we're
going to the moon.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,605
You and Cheech?

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,330
No, ya moron. America.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,564
I told him, don't be stupid.
We got too many gooks to kill.

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,483
That Mao Tse Dung thinks he's
gonna run the whole show.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,926
Be king o' the world.
Is that what you want?

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,642
Be king, like your dad?
Sit on my throne?

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,566
The way I see it,
you're on his throne.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,886
Hey, kill the king, be the king.
That's the world.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,884
If you're feeling sour about it,
write a letter to Napoleon.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,562
Or maybe you've come
to get your revenge.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,765
Me? Nah.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,924
I just want a seat at the table.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
There ain't no table.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,401
There's me.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,848
Everybody else
sits on the floor.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,085
So what're you waiting for?
Sit. Avert your eyes.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,566
I love this part.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,925
Stupid to bring your kid.

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,688
Boy's gotta learn how men are.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,247
Yeah.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,683
But it's the last
lesson he'll ever...

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,288
We should
have waited until daylight...

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,081
Dodd.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,247
Dodd.

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,767
Dodd!

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,248
Thought Hanzee
goes with you on jobs.

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,331
Half-breed is in Luverne
looking for your uncle.

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,810
You're what, 15 now?

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,925
Seventeen.

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
Small for your age.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,286
What? Your dad wants you to
be some kinda professional?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,367
You know, a lawyer, probably.

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,721
Yeah?

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,724
I suppose we could use a lawyer.

53
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,571
Is that what you want, though?

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,247
Punch a clock?

55
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,489
Always thought I
could do what you do.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,642
Bust heads? How
does that work with one arm?

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,161
I can shoot a gun.

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,809
Yeah, but what happens
when you need to reload?

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,845
I'll show you. Pull over.

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,921
Pull over.

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,883
Okay, Wild Bill.
How does this work?

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,883
Ready? Mmm-hmm.

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,200
Look at you.

64
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,728
So, what do you need me to do?

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,606
Get in the car. Tough guy.

66
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,882
Think I got your dial tone

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,929
Think I got Billy Baxter's bone

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,771
Son of a bitch.

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,090
I think I got a Big Mac attack

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,129
Hold the pickles,
hold the lettuce

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,804
Special orders don't upset us

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,885
All we ask is that you
let us serve it your way

73
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,446
There he is.

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,884
Joe Bulo says to say hi.

75
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,080
Whatcha gonna do, big boy?

76
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,401
Give us a kiss?

77
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,683
You want a kiss?
I'll give you a kiss.

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,126
My wrist!

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,400
Kiss the man, son.

80
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,609
Hurry, before he
gets that sticker.

81
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,364
He's still standing.
Hit him again.

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,768
Hit him again!

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,047
Give me a chocolate glaze and...

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,961
And...

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,805
An old-fashioned.
An old-fashioned?

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,881
Come on, get some zip in ya.

87
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,087
It's on them.

88
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,881
Well, it's a war.
Nixon declared it.

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,086
"The war on cancer."

90
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,723
As long as it's not a war on me.

91
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,369
No, no. It's not against you.
It's a war against your body.

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,604
Well, that doesn't sound...

93
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,284
Our doctor said...

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,601
Dr. Gerber?

95
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,727
Mmm-hmm.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,883
Right, Dr. Gerber said
a few weeks of chemo.

97
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,850
He said they caught it early.

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,571
He thought a few weeks
of chemo and, well,

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,525
he thought she'd
be out of the woods.

100
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,924
Your blood work and your X-rays.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,685
These are not,
as they say, good.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,001
I'm getting worse.

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,685
Well, if by "worse" you mean the
cancer's spreading, then, yes.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,722
But there is a trial. A clinical
trial that might be beneficial.

105
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,441
Yeah.

106
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,481
Yeah, of course.

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,005
Mmm-hmm. We'll try anything.

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,640
It's a new drug.

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,241
Let's call it Xanadu.

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,121
Is that its name?

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,650
No, that's just what they're
calling it for the trial.

112
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,045
This drug, Xanadu,
it has shown promise.

113
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,806
And I'll be getting that drug?

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,724
As part of the trial.

115
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,242
Yes. That or a placebo.

116
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,570
A placebo? Um... Uh...

117
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,406
Yeah, I don't understand.

118
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,089
You see, in order to ascertain
the effectiveness of a drug,

119
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,926
it has to be judged in
a controlled setting

120
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,528
against an equal number of patients
that are not getting the drug.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,286
And those patients, the ones not
getting the drug, they get...

122
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,121
Well, it's like a Smartie.
You know Smarties?

123
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,248
Well, hold on.
I'm confused. You said

124
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,961
Betsy would be part
of the trial, so...

125
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,840
Am I getting the real
drug or the fake drug?

126
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,801
That I can't say.

127
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,207
Shall I sign you up?

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,249
That one stuck for sure.

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,411
Ed? Yeah.

130
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,201
I gotta pee.

131
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,523
Sure. Oh.

132
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,011
Might just have ourselves
a fall baby if we're...

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,004
I mean, can you imagine?
You, me, and a baby?

134
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,370
And I'll buy the shop,

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,401
and we'll live like
three pigs in a blanket.

136
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,884
Probably need
more space, though.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,206
What's that, hon?

138
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,401
A bigger house.

139
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,771
Not right away, of course.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,406
I mean, if we have two,
let's say a boy and a girl,

141
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,450
then they'll need their own...

142
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,965
You know, and a yard
if we get a dog...

143
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,487
Anyway, might have to
wait on that seminar.

144
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,721
What?

145
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,722
Yeah, I thought about it

146
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,287
and we just can't
afford it right now.

147
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,489
Not with buying the butcher shop.
That's $500 for...

148
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,607
Unless we find a cheaper one.

149
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,571
A cheaper course?

150
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,401
Yeah.

151
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,761
Well, what?
So I can be a less good me?

152
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,281
No, I...

153
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,607
I'm saying,

154
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,680
on the list of priorities,

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,363
you know, this is our future.

156
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,570
The shop and, you know,
all that other stuff,

157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,244
the knitting class or...

158
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,321
It's not a knitting class.

159
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,527
It's gonna help me
reach my full potential.

160
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,650
Of course, and I know
that. But, hon,

161
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,165
you are so great now.

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm not sure if I could handle
it if you got any better.

163
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,408
Better get dressed, yeah.

164
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,326
Now we got all that
mess cleaned up,

165
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,366
today's the first day
of the rest of our lives.

166
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,927
Help ya?

167
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,643
Got some cars for
sale 'round back.

168
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,481
This one's a repair.

169
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,646
'65 Corvair.

170
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,402
"Light-handed,
light-footed, light-hearted."

171
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,446
I'm not sure what that means.

172
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,285
Oh, ah! No, can't have
ya looking inside.

173
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,884
See, I'm entrusted with the
safety of the customers' effects.

174
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,681
Part of the code, so...

175
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,165
Excuse me? All right? That's...

176
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,125
Like I said, what's
for sale is outside.

177
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,921
He known to you?

178
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,601
Oh, Ed? Yeah.
Yeah, he's a butcher.

179
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,921
I mean...

180
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,889
No, uh, no, never
seen him before.

181
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,321
Butcher where?

182
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,725
All right, see, that's...

183
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,041
Now you got me thinking you're up
to some shady doings, mister...

184
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,521
All right...

185
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,921
Look, I was in Nam, yeah?

186
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,042
Out there they
called me Mad Dog, so...

187
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,885
You watch your...

188
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,371
Do you miss it?

189
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,451
What?

190
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,050
The country.

191
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,602
You know, the wet,
the heat, the bugs.

192
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,361
Do you miss it?

193
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,205
God, no.

194
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,408
It's this quiet
I can't get used to.

195
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,964
This frozen winter.

196
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,881
Yeah, well...

197
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,646
Can't argue with ya.

198
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,405
Did you work the tunnels?

199
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,681
The...

200
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,884
"Send the Indian," they'd say.

201
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,930
"Who cares about booby traps?

202
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,801
"Give Hanzee a
flashlight and a knife

203
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,451
"and send him down
into the black echo."

204
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,487
Moving through the
earth like a rat.

205
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,646
Killing off Charlie.
Taking his ears.

206
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,287
Ears?

207
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,567
You gotta push their faces
down into the dirt

208
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,244
so they don't scream
and wake the others.

209
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,964
Whoo!

210
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,971
Where on God's green
earth do you keep the plunger?

211
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,250
Is there a problem here, Sonny?

212
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,161
I dunno. Of course you don't.

213
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,966
Friend, is there a problem?

214
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,880
He's got a knife, Karl.

215
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,286
Ya, Sonny. I got eyes.

216
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,963
I said, do we got a problem?

217
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,566
He seemed real angry.

218
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,880
Yeah, I got that part.

219
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,649
Any other Einstein insights
you can share with me?

220
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,407
An Indian. I think.

221
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,961
Get the phone, kid.

222
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,128
We better alert
the local constable.

223
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,169
The... The sheriff, you idiot.

224
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,241
Yeah.

225
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,329
Surprised me there at the end.

226
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,889
Your finger. Ya like that?

227
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,600
Didn't say I liked it.
Said you surprised me.

228
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,485
You got that bump, then?

229
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,648
I'm worried your family's gonna
go the wrong way on this thing.

230
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,924
Floyd's smart.
She'll take the money.

231
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,886
What about your dad?

232
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,001
Him?
You probably gotta kill him.

233
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,246
And you're okay with that?

234
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,885
Ya know what depresses me?

235
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,084
I missed the '60s.

236
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,967
Free love,

237
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,971
drop acid, Woodstock.

238
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,291
Wake up one day, decide you wanna
call yourself Flower Rain Blossom?

239
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,286
You just call yourself
Flower Rain Blossom.

240
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,844
Yeah, but the '70s were
always coming like a...

241
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,445
What do you...

242
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,441
A hangover.

243
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,128
And you know what happened
to Flower Rain Blossom?

244
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,288
She's on methadone in Bismarck,

245
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,683
turning tricks
for breakfast meat.

246
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,729
I know, but at least
I would have had fun.

247
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,641
Be free.

248
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,960
Like how you get to dream
before you wake up.

249
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,483
I saw the Indian
left town yesterday.

250
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,801
Hanzee?

251
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,490
Dad sent him to find Rye.

252
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,571
He shot a judge, I heard.

253
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,043
So he's either
hiding out now or dead.

254
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,407
Either way, could
be gone for good.

255
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,845
You're boring me.

256
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,049
I thought we were
gonna have some fun.

257
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,170
We had fun, darling.

258
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,565
All I know is, I can still
feel your finger in my ass.

259
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,051
That was my thumb.

260
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,888
So, the sit-down today.

261
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,325
You think Floyd says yes?

262
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,521
Takes the deal?

263
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,121
What I hear?

264
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,725
She's got a compromise.

265
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,881
Give some,

266
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,361
keep some.

267
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,085
Is that Otto's idea?

268
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,806
Grandpa? No.

269
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,090
He's a legume.

270
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,245
They're taking him
to the doctor later,

271
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,529
see if they can
stop the drooling.

272
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,081
Is that right?

273
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,721
Which doctor?

274
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,045
Thought I'd take Molly ice
fishing this weekend.

275
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,931
Bring something more than
just jerky this time.

276
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,849
That's what my dad brought.
Yeah.

277
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,045
But she's six and she's a girl.

278
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,845
Gonna have to learn this stuff.

279
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,721
So...

280
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,970
Should I be...

281
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,406
I don't know, uh...

282
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,442
Treating you any different?
Please don't.

283
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,564
Well, you let me know. Mmm-hmm.

284
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,767
Better get inside and take
my sugar pills.

285
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,007
State Car 18, come back. Over.

286
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,806
Uh, that's me... Yeah, I know.

287
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,401
Go, I'll be fine.

288
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,769
State Car 18, come back. Over.

289
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,164
Indian buck.
Had, like, a rat face.

290
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,523
Didn't much like
the look of him.

291
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,529
Scared me a little.

292
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,485
Sorry.

293
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,564
Took Betsy to a specialist.

294
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,161
And?

295
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,810
Uh, well, there's a trial.

296
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,850
Clinical. New drug, so...

297
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,041
Uh, we signed up for that.

298
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,245
What did I miss here?

299
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,124
Uh, well, uh...

300
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,241
Well, this Indian fella
put a scare to Sonny.

301
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,489
Luckily, Karl was nearby
stressing the plumbing,

302
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,800
scared the Indian off.

303
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,281
What was he was doing exactly,
this, uh, Indian?

304
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,691
I found him out here in the bay,

305
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,201
looking over Ed's car.
Seemed real interested.

306
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,601
Ed Renner?

307
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,604
No. Ed Blumquist. You know,
works Bud's butcher shop.

308
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,851
Wife's car, technically. Got some
front-end damage, you can see.

309
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,526
As in, front-end damage like the
kind you get running down a gunman

310
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,523
who just shot up three people
at the Waffle Hut?

311
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,841
The what now?

312
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,121
No, no, this was from
a accident yesterday.

313
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,645
Bluth took the report.

314
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,726
Said the Blumquists hit a
tree off Ice Patch Junction.

315
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,640
Tree branch went through the window.
Lucky the wife wasn't killed.

316
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,891
Hit it coming and going?

317
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,928
Yeah, I saw that.

318
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,321
Peggy said garage
door bit her in the back,

319
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,729
but I found bits o' wood
in the bumper so...

320
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,731
I'm not saying she's lying
but, you know, well...

321
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,242
Hey. Burning it at both ends, huh?
Yeah.

322
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,764
You gonna get that?

323
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,441
Yeah.

324
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,446
Thank you for sitting
with me here today,

325
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,091
and for giving us time
to consider your offer.

326
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,004
I've asked the bank to
arbitrate, as neutral party.

327
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,006
Whatever makes you comfortable.
This is your town.

328
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,251
Where's Mr. Milligan?

329
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,721
Another matter.
Back in Kansas City.

330
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,165
So, we've given you 48 hours to consider.
Do we have a deal?

331
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,561
No.

332
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,729
But I have a counter offer.
A respectful one.

333
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,847
Instead of a straight
sale, us to you,

334
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,809
we pay you one million,
cash money,

335
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,247
plus 20%% of our
territory in Minnesota.

336
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,850
We also discount
transportation fees

337
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,371
on all Kansas City merchandise,

338
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,681
25%% for the first five years.

339
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,961
In exchange,

340
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,285
we retain full control of
our remaining operations.

341
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,091
The Gerhardt family
still runs North Dakota,

342
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,689
but with Kansas City.

343
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,246
A partnership, not a sale.

344
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,530
That's our offer to you.

345
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,443
And we believe it's
more than fair.

346
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,127
I see.

347
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,601
Now...

348
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,801
I don't know.

349
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,565
Maybe when you look at
me you see an old woman.

350
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,890
And I am 61.

351
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,520
I've borne six children.
Had three miscarriages.

352
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,569
Two of my sons are here today.

353
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,085
Two were stillborn.

354
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,890
My firstborn,
Elron, killed in Korea.

355
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,321
Gook sniper took
off half his head.

356
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,486
The point is...

357
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,206
Don't assume just
because I'm an old woman

358
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,002
that my back is weak and
my stomach is not strong.

359
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,445
I make this counter because a
deal is always better than war.

360
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,647
But no mistake.

361
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,651
We'll fight to keep what's
ours to the last man.

362
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,849
You're a good woman.

363
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,170
I wish I had known your husband.

364
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,841
No.

365
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,161
My husband would have killed you

366
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,810
where you stood the
first time you met.

367
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,522
So be glad you're
talking to his wife.

368
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,971
Then that's what I'm glad for.

369
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,680
And if it were up to me,
I would take your counter.

370
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,881
Partner up.

371
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,161
Except...

372
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,891
I got to admit, I just wonder,
if we make this deal,

373
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,087
split the territory, we move in,

374
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,400
can you guarantee
your boys will abide?

375
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,202
My sons listen to their mother.

376
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,686
Good. Okay.

377
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,527
Except here are two of my men,

378
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,569
assaulted just this morning

379
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,644
in the appropriation of
donuts by your oldest.

380
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,327
Attacked in peacetime,

381
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,642
during a period of deliberation,

382
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,283
without provocation.

383
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,771
Oh, I was provoked.

384
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,841
Hush.

385
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,968
My sons will abide.

386
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,851
Ah, see, see, that's the problem
with a family business.

387
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,567
Now, if one of my men defies me,

388
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,046
puts a deal in jeopardy,
I take his arm.

389
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,126
If he talks out of turn,
I take his tongue.

390
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,451
But you, your children,

391
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,842
your grandchildren, what
are you willing to do

392
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,729
to show us you're committed?

393
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,601
I'll deal with my son.
This partnership will hold.

394
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,806
Come on. You're
gonna let this guy

395
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,360
come here and disrespect us?
Disrespect Pop?

396
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,568
Quiet!
A bunch o' fruits in ties!

397
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,802
And your pocket protectors?
I'll pick my teeth...

398
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,723
- Take him out!
- Fricking teeth.

399
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,091
Jeez, get off me!

400
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,730
I apologize.

401
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,605
He's a proud man.

402
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,762
His father built an empire,
and he just wants what's his.

403
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,086
He'll fall into line.

404
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,881
No.

405
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,491
I don't think he will.

406
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,441
Hold up.

407
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,125
Who's the dumb-ass?

408
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,088
Go around to the passenger seat.

409
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,441
Slide across.

410
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,161
Hurry up. Hurry up!

411
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,891
Well, what's the hold up?

412
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,405
Think maybe I flooded it.

413
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,402
Take him inside! Go!

414
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,524
Joe Bulo says hi.

415
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,129
Your counter has been rejected.

416
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,041
And now we're lowering
our price by two million.

417
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,287
But because I respect
you and your family,

418
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,761
I'm gonna give you the
night to think it over.

419
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,250
Anything other than
unconditional surrender

420
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,529
and we'll wipe every last Gerhardt
off the face of the Earth.

421
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,841
Hey, Bud.

422
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,801
Where the heck did
you go yesterday?

423
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,965
Yeah, I'm real sorry about
that. Peg had a kinda

424
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,168
emergency, and you know.
. . Well...

425
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,651
You know that check you gave me?
For the down payment?

426
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,801
Yeah?

427
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,964
Yeah, it bounced.

428
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,841
No. That's not...

429
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,442
I checked the account myself.

430
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,730
But anyway, I got the funds.

431
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,131
Well, I don't know about that.

432
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,724
It's just, the check you gave
me didn't clear, so you know...

433
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,125
There's this other buyer,

434
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,841
up in Sleepy Eye, wants to be
closer to his sick mother, yeah.

435
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,408
He offered more than you, and...

436
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,246
I'm moving to Florida, so...

437
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,845
Bud, no.

438
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,530
I got the funds.

439
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,125
Yeah, just let me call over
there, straighten this thing out.

440
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,604
Yeah, so it's Tuesday.
Figure we'd agree Friday.

441
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,331
If you don't got the money,
I'll go ahead and sell to him.

442
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,641
The other buyer.

443
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,447
Like I said,
he's up in Sleepy Eye.

444
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,761
Take a look at that grinder, will ya?
It's making a funny noise.

445
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,884
Jeez, hon. Where's your coat?

446
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,368
Hon, did... Did you...

447
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,960
We talked about this.

448
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,690
Yeah, didn't we talk about this?

449
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,327
What happened?

450
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,084
Something with the car?
Did they find blood?

451
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,089
No, no. This is about the shop.

452
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,649
Yeah? And we shook
on it. Bud and me.

453
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,805
I wrote a check
for the down payment.

454
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,082
And now I am hearing...

455
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,481
Hon...
He said the check bounced.

456
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,850
Insufficient funds. So I
call over there, and...

457
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,486
We agreed, right?

458
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,086
Well, we never... I thought...

459
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,084
You told me. But I never...

460
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,963
Well, now there's
another buyer up in

461
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,088
Sleepy Eye and he's
gonna get the shop.

462
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,322
Well, he can't do that.
You shook on it.

463
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,084
Yeah, but the check bounced!

464
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,926
Insufficient funds.

465
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,291
We talked about this.

466
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,086
Well, if you mean you talked
and then I also talked,

467
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,685
then, yeah, I guess,

468
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,440
but not really sure you heard

469
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,851
anything I said. Yeah, I...

470
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,564
Hon...

471
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,850
I'm sorry. I am.
But you know, this course,

472
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,241
the one I've been
telling ya about,

473
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,969
Lifespring, it's real important.

474
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,447
Yeah. More important
than the shop?

475
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,886
Maybe.

476
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,281
I mean, to me.

477
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,248
Well, I mean, you got to get
the money back. Right away.

478
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,085
I mean, just call them
and tell them you're sorry,

479
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,606
but you need the money.

480
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,563
Ed, it's... 'Cause on Friday

481
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,480
he sells to the fella up in
Sleepy Eye, and then we're

482
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,201
screwed.

483
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,641
Everything okay?

484
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,926
I need the money back.

485
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,082
For the course?
Sent that on already.

486
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,400
I need it back!

487
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,370
Ed says we could lose the shop!

488
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,250
Oh, Ed says.
Well, then, stop the presses.

489
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,931
Come here. Sit down.

490
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,041
I...

491
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,283
Look in that mirror, hon.
Tell me what you see.

492
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,125
I dunno. A girl?

493
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,880
You get your period?

494
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,922
Then what girl? That's a woman.

495
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,891
A strong, beautiful,
vibrant woman.

496
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,042
And no man should be
able to tell you what to do.

497
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,724
Not with your body
or your money.

498
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,971
How much I been paying you here?

499
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,642
Six hundred a month.
And you been saving?

500
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,804
Ed and I put away
one third every week

501
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,086
minus the occasional...

502
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,321
So, 200?

503
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,004
And you gave me
five for the course.

504
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,890
So that's two-and-a-half
months' savings. Your money.

505
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,167
For you to spend as you please.

506
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,804
But I get it. It's what we do.

507
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,162
We surrender our needs to the needs
of men to our great detriment.

508
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,641
But no more. Say it with me.

509
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,610
No more. No more. That's right.

510
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,524
You're gonna go to Sioux Falls and
you're gonna take this course,

511
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,370
and you're gonna be the best
Peggy Blumquist you can be,

512
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,606
and no one's ever gonna tell you
how to live your life again.

513
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,002
What the heck?

514
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,681
Ooh.

515
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,845
You need to invite me in.

516
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,360
I could make some coffee.

517
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,090
None for me. Thanks.

518
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,211
Saw your car. At the shop.

519
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,123
Yeah. I slipped on some
ice on the way to work.

520
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,000
My fault really. I was
going on about something.

521
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,846
Ran right off the
road into a tree.

522
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,685
Lucky Peggy wasn't killed.

523
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,921
Hmm.

524
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,281
Something wrong?

525
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,846
No, I just...

526
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,885
I'm sorry.

527
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,450
Come in. Sit down. Please.

528
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,368
I wanna be clear
about something.

529
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,080
I can help, but you gotta
be straight with me.

530
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,365
Well, what...

531
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,129
If I check the car,
the interior,

532
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,770
I'm not gonna find blood?

533
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,803
Oh, well, Ed hurt
his neck, but...

534
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,609
That's why I got the...
No blood.

535
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,444
You didn't fight, did you, Ed?

536
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,761
In the war. No, sir.

537
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,002
4-F on account I got
the one kidney, so...

538
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,646
There's a look a boy gets
when he's been shot.

539
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,323
Or a landmine takes
off his legs.

540
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,527
And he's laying there in
the mud, trying to get up,

541
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,169
'cause he doesn't feel it yet.

542
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,725
I don't... His brain

543
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,326
hasn't caught up with
the reality, which is

544
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,726
he's already dead.

545
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,801
Ed, he's scaring me.

546
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,685
But we see it.

547
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,801
The rest of us.

548
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,721
And we lie.

549
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,210
We say, "Lay still.
You're gonna be fine."

550
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,760
If you'd been to war,
you'd know the look.

551
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,163
See, you and Peggy,
you got the look.

552
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,445
You still think it's Tuesday.

553
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,000
You have no idea what's coming.

554
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,323
Lou, I'm really trying to
be straight with you here.

555
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,129
We hit some ice. And...

556
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,010
That's all, I mean, it
could've happened to anyone.

557
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,600
Ed wasn't even speeding.
That man you hit?

558
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,523
His name was Rye Gerhardt.

559
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,523
Hit a tree. We told ya.

560
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,162
I mean, we were arguing,
and Ed turned his head.

561
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,287
It happened in a flash.

562
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,964
Rye Gerhardt.

563
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,961
And his family hurts
people for money.

564
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,527
And they're coming.

565
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,371
May be here already.

566
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,163
And my point is, 'cause
I'm tired o' talking,

567
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,484
if you did something, you
made a mistake, you panicked,

568
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,201
maybe covered it up, now's
the time to say. Right now.

569
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,681
'Cause we can still fix this.

570
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,930
But if I'm right, that window's
closing and you may already be dead.

571
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,761
- Look...
- This is...

572
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,408
You're out of line.
I mean, we...

573
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,124
We want you to leave. No offense
but we're asking you to leave.

574
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,165
Is that true, Ed?

575
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,364
Ed? Is that true?
You're asking me to leave?

576
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,127
You know, Lou, that's probably
for the best, yeah.

577
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,287
It was an accident.
That's all it was.

578
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,361
Okay.

579
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,884
Do yourself a favor.
Lock the door.

580
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,485
Ma?

581
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,926
Everyone's together.

582
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,441
We need to know...

583
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,080
What do you wanna do?

584
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,920
It's war.

585
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,929
Hon? Yeah, it's me.

586
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,288
You should go back to bed, huh?

587
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,606
You expecting someone?

588
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,927
Not really, couldn't sleep.

589
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,609
I think you got the real pill.

590
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,841
Yeah?

591
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,564
You hope or you think?

592
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,565
We're just out of balance.

593
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,761
You and me?

594
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,646
Whole world.

595
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,444
We used to know
right from wrong.

596
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,845
A moral center.

597
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,241
Now...

598
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,126
You should go into bed.

599
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,641
I'm gonna sit out
here for a while.

600
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,162
Make sure we're, I dunno, safe.
