1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,162
Mama, can I, huh?
Mama, can I, huh, huh?

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,443
Can I, Mama, won't you please let me?
Mama, can I, huh?

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,047
That's the sweetest little dress,
Sally Where'd you get the pattern?

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,771
Made me one just like it
out of yellow dotted Swiss

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,807
Yes, I guess we got the
earliest garden in the county

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,009
Beneath the strawberries are a
heap of snappin' green beans

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,447
Too bad about your boy

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,442
Mama, make Willie
quit pulling at my hair

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,961
Mama, ouch! Ouch!
Mama, just make Willie quit it

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,402
Tommy, if ya
don't put down that stick

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,767
I'm gonna wear you out
with it Boy, be quick

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,446
Come quick, Sammy Jean stuck
her finger in a Coke bottle

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,568
Can't get it out 'cause
it's stuck, stuck, stuck

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,961
Now I told you my mama
didn't raise no fool

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,691
I can do anything
if I got the right tools

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,808
Mama, can I, huh?
Mama, can I, huh, huh?

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,406
Can I, Mama, won't you please let me?
Mama, can I, huh?

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,522
Jeremy Kleiner up
in Winnipeg writes,

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,921
"Feel better, boss man."
That's nice.

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,370
And then,

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,170
Carter Bunch says,

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,891
"Keep fightin', you old cuss.
You'll outlive us all."

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,964
Indian Joe sent porn.

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,565
Give these to the Chinaman.
The usual disbursement.

25
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,322
Get your dad and uncles.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,646
We need to talk.

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,365
You finish your chores?

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,568
Yes, sir. Been helpin'
Grandma with the bank.

29
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,167
She sent me to get you. Wants us
all together up in the house.

30
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Dodd's inside.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,845
...fought in
the trenches in France.

32
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,126
World War I.

33
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,611
He was an Artillerieschützen,
my granddad, a gunner.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,046
Blasted mustard
gas at the Allies.

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,691
Had 'em dancing
like poisoned rats.

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,802
The Brits caught him in a raid,

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,884
hung him by his thumbs
for six days straight,

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,850
so this, what we're doin',
this is nothin'.

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,730
Are you listening to me?

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,891
Is he listening to me?

41
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,606
Cut off his ears.

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,600
Wake him up.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,448
He's dead, I think.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,321
Weak.

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,646
Uncle Dodd?

46
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,128
Doc's finished.
Grandma wants us.

47
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,410
Who were the goons?

48
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,881
Kansas City.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,570
They wanna buy us out.

50
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,210
So they came to you, then?

51
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,328
They came to see your father.
But he's not well.

52
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,687
So they talked to
me as a surrogate.

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,006
I should have been there.

54
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,686
Jeez, Dad. Don't be such a baby.

55
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,841
Shut up.

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,331
She shouldn't be in here.

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,851
She's old enough.
I told her to stay.

58
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,081
She's a girl.

59
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,563
And girls grow up to be women,

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,724
and change boys' diapers.

61
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,564
Where's your little brother?

62
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,007
Rye? Haven't seen him.

63
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,129
Who knows with that kid? Probably
neck deep in some pussy.

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,801
With a girl, you know.

65
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,481
What's the offer?

66
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,129
He talks to you. Where is he?

67
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,567
Said he had things
to do out of town.

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,404
- I saw him yesterday.
- What things?

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,801
What's the offer?

70
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,083
The world's
becoming more corporate.

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,730
This was their pitch to me.

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,444
And in this new world there's
no room for family business.

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,766
So, war.

74
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,931
They're offering to buy
the whole operation,

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,331
then pay us to run it.

76
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,041
Bottom line?

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,726
Bottom line, very little
changes on the ground.

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,331
We may actually earn more.

79
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,084
But instead of running it,
we report to them.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,924
To who? Kansas City.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,485
Balls. What'd you say?

82
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,611
I said thank you very much,
I'll consult with my partners.

83
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,886
Meaning, Grandpa.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,047
No.

85
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,766
The stroke.

86
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,408
Your father is not
in a lucid state.

87
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,725
Nor will he be, possibly ever.

88
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,606
What are you saying?

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,843
I'm saying your grandpa
built this business,

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,048
but he's no longer
capable of running it.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,321
We should have
a moment of silence, maybe.

92
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,607
As new boss,

93
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,331
I say we tell these
Kansas City schwanzes

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,481
to go to hell in the fast lane.

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,607
Now, hold on.

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,045
What, you think
it should be you?

97
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
No, stupid.

98
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,441
Mom.

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,204
Boss can't be a woman!

100
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,325
Who says?

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,206
Think about it.

102
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,363
Mom's the one with
ties to Winnipeg.

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,971
History with Carter B
and the Solkerk crew.

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,565
Suppliers trust her.

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,560
It should be Mom.

106
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,927
Hell, yes. I vote for Grandma.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,082
Shut up. We're not voting.

108
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,925
I'm oldest.

109
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,566
I'm boss.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,925
End of story.

111
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,691
Give us a minute.

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,771
Not you.

113
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,127
Sit.

114
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,046
Eat somethin'.

115
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,607
This moment,

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,122
how things go in
the next few weeks,

117
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,801
will decide...

118
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,928
That's why... Let me finish!

119
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,244
Your grandfather left the
ashes of the Weimar Republic

120
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,971
and came to this country
to build a name for himself.

121
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,965
He built an empire

122
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,810
from a shoe shine box,

123
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,006
and then and only then
did he send for your father.

124
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,925
Ma. I know the story.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,002
No. You don't.

126
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,006
'Cause if you did, you'd know that
you are just a small part of it.

127
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,604
That's what an empire is.

128
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,045
It's bigger than any son.

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,161
Or daughter.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,126
Eat.

131
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,166
I'm not hungry.

132
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,567
I'm your mother,
you will eat with me.

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
Your time will come.

134
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,521
It will.

135
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,005
But this isn't it.

136
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,204
And if you stand by me now,

137
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,123
I promise you that as soon
as this crisis is over,

138
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,202
I'll hand you your legacy

139
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,047
and I'll turn my
thoughts to the grave.

140
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,767
Now, we need to find Rye.

141
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,966
Can you do that for me?

142
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,087
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,766
Wherever he is,
whatever he's doing,

144
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,887
bring him home.

145
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,089
If you were
a betting man, I'm sayin'.

146
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,764
Well, I think history has proven

147
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,401
people of the Germanic
persuasion don't surrender easy.

148
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,690
But you can kill 'em.

149
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,809
Unless the woman,
being a woman...

150
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,046
Maybe we can scare her.

151
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,007
No.

152
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,447
I think we cut a deal
with one of the sons.

153
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,289
The youngest maybe, Rye.

154
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,441
The elders are...

155
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,441
Well, you know how a lobster's got
a pincher claw and a crusher claw?

156
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,606
Which one's which?

157
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,681
Pardon?

158
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,204
Which son is which claw?

159
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,725
You know what? Forget it.

160
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,610
I don't want anything to do
with your fakakta metaphor.

161
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,321
Management says acquire the
territory, we acquire it.

162
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,483
Whether that's cash down or
sending bodies to the morgue,

163
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,528
that's up to the krauts.

164
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,927
First Gerhardt to switch sides
gets a shiny red apple.

165
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,321
No, I know.

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,001
I know. Uh-huh.

167
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,041
No, no. Sheriff says
it's a local matter.

168
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,051
Yeah.

169
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,041
Okay then.

170
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,641
Yeah.

171
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,201
- Papa.
- That's me.

172
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,281
Papa!

173
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,850
Did you get some sleep?

174
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,641
Uh... A couple hours,
you know. Went pretty late.

175
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,801
- Papa. Papa.
- What? What?

176
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,370
What can I make you?

177
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,681
Uh, eggs would be good,
if not a bother.

178
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,330
I could do oatmeal, maybe.

179
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,441
Tell me a story.

180
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,170
Somethin' about
the smell of eggs right now...

181
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,685
Okay, coffee's fine.

182
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,121
Uh...

183
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,529
Okay.

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,561
Once upon a time
there was an oyster.

185
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,687
What's an oyster?

186
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,171
It's a shellfish.

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,321
Fish?

188
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,004
Close enough. Lou sleepin'?

189
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,560
He had a call with the brass.
Should be down soon.

190
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,082
Apparently, one of your
victims was a judge.

191
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,084
- A judge, huh? Uh-huh.

192
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,401
The older woman?

193
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,086
Out of North Dakota.

194
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,681
Huh.

195
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,847
Papa!

196
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,365
Hello. Yes.

197
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,771
What's the story?

198
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,171
What story?

199
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,810
About the oyster.

200
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,881
Oh, uh...

201
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,041
Yeah.

202
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,451
Sorry. Lieutenant called.

203
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,321
Judge, huh?

204
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,370
- Betsy told you.
- Yeah.

205
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,681
Yeah, municipal
judge up in Fargo.

206
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,245
Huh. Oh, yeah.

207
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,850
One day, the oyster
got caught in the net.

208
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,607
Fisherman pulled him up,
all set to eat him.

209
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,444
Except he happened to have
his daughter in the boat.

210
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,726
And she said...

211
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,882
"Daddy, how would you feel

212
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,486
"if I peeled the roof off
your house and ate you?"

213
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,806
Was that you?

214
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,721
It was.

215
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,844
That's the story of
how your mom and me

216
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,287
came to eat hot dogs for
dinner, once again.

217
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,361
Mmm-hmm.

218
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,046
Hey, so knowing she's a judge,
that change anything?

219
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,044
Well, you know, I guess
we gotta ask ourselves,

220
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,280
was this judge just in the
wrong place at the wrong time,

221
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,051
or was this
whole mess about her?

222
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,727
Gonna be late for work, huh?

223
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,562
Yeah, I don't think
I'm goin' in today.

224
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,721
Well, gotta keep up
appearances though, right?

225
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,006
You said.

226
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,170
Jeez, hon, your eye...

227
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,403
No, it doesn't hurt. It just.
. . It looks bad.

228
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,890
Maybe I should stay home too.

229
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,525
No. You should go.

230
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,886
Just tell them you hit
your head or something.

231
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,086
I gotta...

232
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,521
There's too much
stuff to do here.

233
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,886
I...

234
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,282
Car's gotta be cleaned,
the floors.

235
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,446
I mean...

236
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,846
Yeah.

237
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,445
Are you with me?

238
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,721
Good.

239
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,891
Bear's thrown in with Momma.
That's his loss.

240
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,360
Distributors will stand
with me, if I press.

241
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,720
But we need Rye.

242
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,886
So, when you find him, you bring
him to me first, you understand?

243
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,450
Not her. Me.

244
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,527
There you go.

245
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,131
Thanks.

246
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,726
Remember to cook them
all the way through this time.

247
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,566
Oh. Thank you. Hey there, Peggy.

248
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,687
Hey.

249
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,966
Expecting your husband.

250
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,601
Yeah, he had...

251
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,809
At dinner last night,
I think it was some bad clams.

252
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,211
You know, from a can.

253
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,567
Never trust anything
that comes from the sea.

254
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,051
We came from the sea.

255
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,045
Tomorrow, for sure.

256
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,167
Okay.

257
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,571
- Bye.
- Bye.

258
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,202
...a desperado, I heard.

259
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,567
But Sheriff thinks a pair of 'em

260
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,688
gunned down those poor people
at the Waffle Hut

261
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,808
one after another in cold blood.

262
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,801
I mean, first Watergate
and now this.

263
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,364
What's the world coming to?

264
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,042
Sorry, Mrs. Colson.
Car wouldn't start.

265
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,925
I'll ditch the coat and get
you squared away, okay?

266
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,641
Big night?

267
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,721
Huh?

268
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,565
Got a hangover?

269
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,641
Oh!

270
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,241
No, it's just a migraine.

271
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,721
You talk to Ed?

272
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,327
Did I...

273
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,728
About the seminar. Next weekend?

274
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,802
Got us a room at
the Southnick Hotel.

275
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,961
Oh, yeah.

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,923
I don't know.
It's a lot of money.

277
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,007
And we're saving up right now,
so Ed can buy the butcher shop.

278
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,880
What I'm hearing, is you think your
husband's more important than you,

279
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,086
his needs.

280
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,441
No. I just...

281
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,770
We got a plan, you know?

282
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,845
The word "we" is a castle, hon,
with a moat and a drawbridge.

283
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,843
And you know what gets
locked up in castles?

284
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,090
Dragons?

285
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,685
Princesses.

286
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,569
Don't be a prisoner of "we."

287
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,331
Take the seminar.

288
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,167
It'll give you
a key to the castle.

289
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,847
Yeah.

290
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,364
Oh, hey, you don't know what
happened to all the TP, do you?

291
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,441
The what's that?

292
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,325
Had a case of TP in the back last week.
Somebody took it.

293
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,328
Yes, sir. I know I said it
was a local matter last night,

294
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,811
but I slept on it, you know?

295
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,807
And given the level of violence,
and with no apparent suspects,

296
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,770
and the fact that one of
the victims was a judge...

297
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,251
Right, in North Dakota,

298
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,891
which means you're gonna have
all kinds of interstate issues.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,483
So, my thought is, you know,
all the more reason for me...

300
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,006
Yes, sir.

301
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,686
Thank you, sir.

302
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,083
I'll coordinate
with Sheriff Larsson,

303
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,446
and head up to Fargo
first thing tomorrow.

304
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,521
Yep.

305
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,880
Yeah, I know, we...

306
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,811
You said all that,
but my point...

307
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,560
What I'm trying to...

308
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,561
I've got the money, see...
I've got...

309
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,281
Uh...

310
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,441
I...

311
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,249
I mean, I will have.

312
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,881
So, you just need to hold
the Selectrics for me until...

313
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,201
Uh...

314
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,329
So, just hold them, okay?
Don't...

315
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,728
And I'll call you back.

316
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,881
Hi, there.

317
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,720
Money troubles?

318
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,847
What?

319
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,644
Oh! No, he double-billed me
for something, is all.

320
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,246
Just straightening things out.

321
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,601
I see.

322
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,241
Yeah.

323
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,561
We're not really open,
is the thing.

324
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,968
Waitin' for new
models to come in.

325
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,805
So, closed temporarily.

326
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,640
That's okay.

327
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,529
We're not really customers.

328
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,327
Okay, well...

329
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,731
Rye Gerhardt.

330
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,885
Is that your name, or...

331
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,687
I mean, geez,
I met the guy, of course.

332
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,442
Once or twice.

333
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,686
Were you...

334
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,441
Did you need
a character reference or...

335
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,731
That's good.

336
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
I like that.

337
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,485
"A character reference."

338
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,644
How about you just
tell us where he is,

339
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,449
seeing as he
works for you and all.

340
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,167
Well, isn't that what
you told Big Jim Suggs?

341
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,963
Over at the Pig
'n' Poke yesterday?

342
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,886
Had a few drinks.

343
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,644
Told him you had
a Gerhardt in your pocket.

344
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,721
I never...

345
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,849
Ow!

346
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,848
Kids today love to
talk on the phone,

347
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,483
but I'm a big
believer in correspondence,

348
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,969
friendly or otherwise.

349
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,365
"If you've got a complaint,"
is my motto,

350
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,805
"put it in writing."

351
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,881
For instance,

352
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,371
last week I bought one of those

353
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,966
new automated
coffeemakers at Sears.

354
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,642
You know, the one
with the clock inside?

355
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,051
And the thing is,
pardon my French,

356
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,485
a real piece of shit.

357
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,005
So, what do I do?

358
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,446
"Dear General Electric,

359
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,560
"the coffee maker that I
bought at Sears on 11th March

360
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,603
"makes a noise when it's brewing

361
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,569
"that sounds like a fat man
having a heart attack."

362
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,331
Stop!

363
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,882
"And it forces me
to ask the question,

364
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,561
"is this why our once-great
nation is going down the crapper?

365
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,564
"Yours in peace and harmony,

366
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,445
"Mike Milligan."

367
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,126
The judge!

368
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,201
Go on.

369
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,688
All I said was talk to her.

370
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,841
What judge?

371
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,765
Mundt!

372
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,285
Judge Mundt!

373
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,170
Talk to her.

374
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,366
That's what you said?

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,081
Yeah.

376
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,081
Why?

377
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,081
What happened?

378
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,567
There he goes!

379
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,642
Don't let him get away, man!

380
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,927
Get a rope and we'll hang him!

381
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,251
One hour ahead of the posse

382
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,085
The bloodhounds
are hot on my trail

383
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,364
Last evening I shot down
my sweetheart

384
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,125
This morning I broke out of jail

385
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
My Pinto is tired and hungry

386
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,040
And I'm feeling weary and gone

387
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,371
We started ahead of the posse

388
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,490
And we got to keep going on

389
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,486
The Sheriff has sworn
he will get me

390
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,531
He's riding with 20 and five

391
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,527
But I ain't afeared
of that posse

392
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,924
For they'll never
will get me alive

393
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,605
One hour ahead of the posse

394
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,843
No turning to left or to right

395
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,480
We must win the race
to the river

396
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,571
Or there'll be a hanging tonight

397
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,090
We're gonna hang him tonight

398
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,811
One hour ahead of the posse

399
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,125
And now I'm inside on my own

400
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,165
At last we have
beaten that posse

401
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,849
May the Lord have mercy
on my soul

402
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,564
You said to remind you I got
that specialist appointment Tuesday.

403
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,721
Dad said he'd watch Molly.

404
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,801
I'll drive you.

405
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,290
You sure? You got the case.

406
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,486
I'll drive you.

407
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,922
We feel so special, don't we?

408
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,411
Gettin' Daddy for lunch.

409
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,887
Daddy!

410
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,443
Captain said wait
on going up to Fargo.

411
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,842
He needs to work out some kind
of chain of command BS, so...

412
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,647
Hon?

413
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,727
Hon?

414
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,166
Sorry.

415
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,211
I got a wild hair.

416
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,131
Something's not adding up.

417
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,126
Stay here, okay? Uh-huh.

418
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,725
What's Daddy doing?

419
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,041
Work stuff.

420
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,405
You wanna build a snowman?

421
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,006
You wanna build a snowman?

422
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,320
Can we do it over there?

423
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,606
How 'bout right here?

424
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,250
Okay, should we
start getting some snow?

425
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,401
Yeah!

426
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,169
What are you gonna
call the snowman, Molly?

427
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,725
Maybe Bob.

428
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,281
Yeah.

429
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,206
All right, we got the bottom.

430
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,009
Next, we need to make the body.

431
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,084
I need you to find me
some sticks for the arms.

432
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,366
Okay? Yeah.

433
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,487
Thank you.

434
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,761
Momma! Yeah?

435
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,080
Look what I found!

436
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,481
Can I keep it?

437
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,326
No, hon. It's got a rip.

438
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,442
That's trash now. Okay?

439
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,841
Okay, okay.

440
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,681
Hon!

441
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,046
Look at this!

442
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,168
Look what I found.
That's great, hon.

443
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,480
I found it in the bushes.

444
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,130
- Fingerprints.
- Yeah, I know.

445
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,804
Jeez, I got it by the barrel.

446
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,041
What's that?

447
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,248
Momma's doing Daddy's job again.

448
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,805
Go, Momma!

449
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,880
You okay, hon? Yeah.

450
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,325
I stood up too fast, is all.

451
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,966
Help you, Officer?

452
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,725
Sir, please roll up your window.

453
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,451
My friend up front doesn't
like to talk to strangers.

454
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,083
Well, he's gonna talk to me.

455
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,809
Rock County.

456
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,927
It's like...

457
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,249
What's that town
on The Flintstones?

458
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,806
Is that where we are?

459
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,209
On the Flintstones?

460
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,602
All right, that's it.
Out of the car, all of you.

461
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,600
Your friends, too.

462
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,241
Come around
the driver's side here.

463
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,811
Okay, let me see some IDs.

464
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,210
I'm gonna reach in my pocket.

465
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,846
Now them.

466
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,161
Mike Milligan

467
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,724
and two named Kitchen.

468
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,687
Brothers, yeah?

469
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,683
Yes, sir. That's us.

470
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,085
Kansas City.

471
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,885
What's this about,
Sheriff, if I'm okay to ask?

472
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,683
Now, if I were to search you
three, would I find weapons?

473
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,205
Well, sir.

474
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,567
You have nothin'
to fear from us.

475
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,371
We're just passin' through town
on our way to points south.

476
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,930
Thought we'd stop
for some waffles.

477
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,411
Gale's idea.

478
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,370
Heard you had some
real good ones around here.

479
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,283
So, you can imagine our surprise

480
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,365
when we find the place closed, and,
apparently, the scene of a crime.

481
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,769
What size shoes you boys wear?

482
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,602
Now, that is
a truly odd question.

483
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,962
Last time I checked,
I was a 10. Boys?

484
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,323
Now, I'm gonna go ahead
and guess the boys are an 11,

485
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,841
and not a two, which would
make them toddlers.

486
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,410
Now, unless there's
some law been broken,

487
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,562
I think it's time for
us to be on our way.

488
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,529
I promised the boys' wives
I'd have them home for supper.

489
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,286
And I am, if nothing else,
a man of my word.

490
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,641
Okay.

491
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,482
I got your names
and your plate number.

492
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,846
I'm gonna radio ahead and make
sure you make it out of state.

493
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,681
If not,

494
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,969
I'm gonna put out a APB,
and have you boys rounded up.

495
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,610
And then we'll talk again.

496
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,086
You understand?

497
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,487
I do.

498
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,204
And isn't that a minor miracle?

499
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,526
The state of the world today,

500
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,683
the level of conflict
and misunderstanding,

501
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,208
that two men could stand on a
lonely road in winter and talk,

502
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,850
calmly and rationally.

503
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,960
While all around them
people are losing their mind.

504
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,560
You have a nice day.

505
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,849
- Good night, Noreen.
- Okay then.

506
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,247
Don't be silly.
I'll give you a ride.

507
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,962
You sure?
I don't wanna be a bother.

508
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,411
No bother.

509
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,687
Come on, sexy. Get in.

510
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,450
Right to the right, there.

511
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,488
Ooh! You're a life saver.

512
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,927
It's a real mess.

513
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,161
Thanks, doll.

514
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,447
Shouldn't have had
all that ginger ale.

515
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,681
Ed?

516
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,081
Ed?

517
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,205
Well, I might take a plane

518
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,123
Might take a train

519
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,363
if I got to walk,
I'm going just the same

520
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,727
I'm going to Kansas City

521
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,608
Kansas City, here I come

522
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,489
They got some crazy
little women there

523
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,608
Jeez. What happened to your car?

524
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,331
Oh, no. It's nothing.
Just a dust-up.

525
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,880
Ed had a few too many last
night, and hit a tree.

526
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,130
He's fine though. Just shook up.

527
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,201
What about you?

528
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,045
Me? Oh, no, I wasn't...
I was home.

529
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,566
Those bills aren't
gonna pay themselves.

530
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,321
You're kind of
a bad girl, aren't you?

531
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,284
Yeah, you are.

532
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,046
I'm usually able to tell right
away, but you had me fooled.

533
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,641
Oh, it's nothin'.
I just bumped it, is all.

534
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,444
In the dust-up?

535
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,921
Thought you weren't
in the car, you said.

536
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,960
It's okay. You don't
have to tell the truth.

537
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,326
I'm not even mad about the TP.

538
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,482
Next time, just ask though.

539
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,405
Or maybe that's what you like.

540
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,887
Huh?

541
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,166
Breaking the rules?

542
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,089
Thanks for the ride, okay?

543
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,721
I've just got a real bad headache,
like I said before, and...

544
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,485
So maybe, I'll just see you
at work tomorrow, okay?

545
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,684
Sleep well, now.

546
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,046
Didn't expect
you'd still be here.

547
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,121
Yeah.

548
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,250
Found possibly the murder weapon
over in the bushes there.

549
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,609
Betsy did, I mean,

550
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,843
if I'm being honest,
which I try to be.

551
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,371
So, now I'm wondering
what else I missed.

552
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,125
Anything interesting
on that car I called in?

553
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,447
Oh...

554
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,524
Those fellows were
positively fascinating.

555
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,248
Nothin' actionable, though.

556
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,885
Cook fell funny, is the truth.

557
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,010
Why I'm still here.

558
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,129
Got stuck in my head.

559
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,571
Callback.

560
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,122
Heard it referred to once
as a convergence.

561
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,726
You know, one thing
reminds you of another.

562
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,847
Yeah.

563
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,525
Wanna talk about it?

564
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,965
Not especially.

565
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,490
We had a guy on the boat, liked
to smoke cigars for breakfast.

566
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,006
Picked up the habit
from his granddad, he said.

567
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,801
This was on the Bode River, '74.

568
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,165
So, I'm on the wheel,
this kid comes out...

569
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,811
'Cause what could he
have been? Nineteen?

570
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,440
Lights his shit stick,
and then...

571
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,968
He never even saw it coming.

572
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,282
Shot him right
through the cigar.

573
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,648
A one-in-a-million shot.

574
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,726
And the look on his
face when he fell...

575
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,450
Just like the cook.

576
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,485
Bafflement.

577
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,961
Yeah.

578
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,608
This German captain
hung himself.

579
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,125
1945.

580
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,490
Found him in
a bunker during the mop-up,

581
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,804
face all purple,

582
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,764
eyes bugged out.

583
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,969
Then in '62,
I'm responding to a suicide.

584
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,924
Fellow's in his bathroom,

585
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,561
swinging from an electric cord.

586
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,765
You never know. Mmm.

587
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,131
War stories.

588
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,169
Different now, though.

589
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,250
After WWII,

590
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,042
we went six years
without a murder here.

591
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,451
Six years.

592
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,203
Now, these days, well...

593
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,487
Sometimes I wonder if you boys
didn't bring that war home with you.

594
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,086
Hey. Burnin' it
at both ends, huh?

595
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,491
Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,164
Double shift for me.

597
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,930
Yeah. Hear what happened?

598
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,402
- At the Waffle Hut? Yeah.
- Yeah.

599
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,361
Real mess. Yeah.

600
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,648
The killer still
at large, they say?

601
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,404
Yeah, we think so.

602
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,326
Anyway, saw your light on.

603
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,004
You know, Molly loves
bacon for breakfast.

604
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,650
I seem to remember we're out.

605
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,961
So, I thought, if you don't
mind, I'd pick some up,

606
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,610
be there when she woke up.

607
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,761
Yeah. Yeah?

608
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,330
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

609
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,281
Uh...

610
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,286
So, you want fatback or...

611
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,361
Well, lean, if you got it.

612
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,487
Okay.

613
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,766
Third of a pound.

614
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,009
So, how's Peggy?

615
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,491
Yeah, she's, uh...

616
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,045
She's doin' good.

617
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,566
You know, doin' real...

618
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,041
Work's good, she says.

619
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,961
Yeah, I think
Betsy's coming in this week

620
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,009
for a trim, which...

621
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,128
I don't know why I know that.

622
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,326
Wives...

623
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,725
They talk whether
we're listening or not.

624
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,330
Yeah? Oh, yeah. Oh.

625
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,560
No, it's... It's on the house.

626
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,920
No, no, let me...

627
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,570
No, I... I got it.

628
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,564
I... I got it, here we go.
All right, hold on.

629
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,610
You gonna get that?

630
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,361
Yeah.

631
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,401
Yeah.

632
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,928
Why is it takin' so long?

633
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,809
Yeah, it's just...

634
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,842
The wife... I'm almost done.
Right.

635
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,208
Well, can you hurry up? I don't
like being here by myself.

636
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,206
Thanks.

637
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,846
Ed?

638
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,805
Ed?

639
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,967
Ed?

640
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,087
Yeah.

641
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,249
Yeah, I still gotta...

642
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,650
You know, it takes time,
grinding a whole...

643
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,245
No, I know. I...

644
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,370
I just miss you, is all.

645
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,488
No, I miss you too, hon.

646
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,361
It's just...

647
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,601
I'll make some oatmeal, okay?

648
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,967
And we can have breakfast
when you get home.

649
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,920
Okay.

650
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,005
I love you.

651
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,525
Love you, too.

652
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,761
Bye.

653
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,610
No one would've believed,

654
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,047
in the last years
of the 19'th century

655
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,248
that human affairs
were being watched

656
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,283
from the timeless
worlds of space.

657
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,010
No one could've dreamed
we were being scrutinized,

658
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,004
as someone with a microscope
studies creatures that swarm

659
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,123
and multiply in a drop of water.

660
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,526
Few men even consider the possibility
of life on other planets,

661
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,764
and yet,
across the gulf of space,

662
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,730
minds immeasurably
superior to ours,

663
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,804
regarded this
earth with envious eyes

664
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,722
and slowly and surely they
drew their plans against us.
