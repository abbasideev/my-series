1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,849
Erstwhile on Fargo...

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,605
You're not gonna prove
my Ed did anything wrong.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,806
It's unprovable!

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,127
There was a cleaver
in the man's head, son,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,725
which Noreen said was you.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,325
Not to mention
there's a war going on

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,640
up in Fargo that
you may have started

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,051
when you ran over
that Gerhardt boy.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,287
Take care of this butcher.

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,646
He doesn't live
through the night.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,922
Already dead, believe me.
He just doesn't know it.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,762
- Sheriff?
- Go inside now, Peggy.

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,281
Go now.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,730
Ed home? Ed who?

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,925
No, Peggy, hey, hey...

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,483
When I find you, darling,
I'm gonna make you bleed.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,604
I need to find Peggy.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,920
You're still in my custody.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,602
You look worse than me.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,809
Don't tire yourself.
We know where he's headed.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,848
Hon! Hon!

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,841
Peggy?

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,881
Peggy?

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,008
Have you actualized fully?

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,846
What?

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,561
Have you actualized fully?

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,968
I don't know.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,249
I mean, I'm trying.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,128
Do you feel cold sometimes,

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,361
even when it's hot?

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,805
Sometimes.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,165
Do you understand
the difference between

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,605
thinking and being?

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,771
What do you mean?

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,926
Do you understand the difference
between thinking and being?

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,001
I...

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,600
To be, is simply to exist.

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,486
Try it.

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,324
Try simply being.

40
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,810
I'm sorry,

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,288
but how is sitting here gonna help
me be the best person I can be?

42
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,561
Ah.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,688
You want an explanation.

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,331
Well, kinda.

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,328
The human mind, aroused by
an insistence for meaning,

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,324
seeks and finds nothing

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,606
but contradiction

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,841
and nonsense.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,608
Okay. It's just...

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,480
Practically, I'm saying,
as a person...

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,925
A married person, a woman

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,800
who's worried she's not living
up to her full potential.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,881
Hmm.

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,043
Think or be.

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,804
You can't do both.

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,564
You're saying, "Don't think
about the person I wanna be,

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,529
"just be that person."

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,881
Peggy.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,925
Don't think about the person I
wanna be, just be that person.

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,761
Just be that person.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,441
Peggy? Peggy, are you okay?

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,683
We were just talking, and
it all finally makes sense!

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,250
This lady has lost
her mind, brother.

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,443
Shut up. She's seeing
people who are not there.

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,561
I said, shut up!

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,005
Here I am tied up for no reason.

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,324
A concerned citizen just walking
past, and I hear a cry for help.

68
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,806
No, you're a Gerhardt.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,491
And you're shit on my shoe.

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,244
Why don't you come here,
let me wipe you off.

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,490
Okay, are the cops coming?
Who knows who else.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,324
Okay, no time to pack.
Just the clothes on our back.

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,084
Okay. Okay? Okay.

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,330
Did you... No.

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,243
It was him.
He's the leader, I think.

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,769
Then we take him with us.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,001
Peg!

78
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,844
We're taking his car?

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,729
Yeah, they'll be
looking for ours.

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,081
I understand now, hon.

81
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,161
Come on.

82
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,044
Everything. What I have to do.

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,566
That's good.
Now watch your head.

84
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,006
Got one!

85
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,120
Gunshot.

86
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,445
Got another.

87
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,003
Gerhardts, I'm thinking.

88
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,442
No sign of Ed or Peggy.

89
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,330
I'm calling a medic.

90
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,091
Yeah, probably a good idea.

91
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,768
This is just embarrassing.

92
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,642
I'll get an APB out
on the Gerhardt boys,

93
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,001
then see about starting
a hunt for Ed and Peggy.

94
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,050
Don't tell Betsy I'm down.

95
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,761
Yeah, she scares me more
than you, so I'm gonna call.

96
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,966
Oh, you...

97
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,450
I've just been doing it all wrong.
Both of us.

98
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,124
We make a trade, hon,
is what I'm thinking.

99
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,645
Wanting things, pretending
to be something we're not.

100
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,529
Selling their man back
to them for freedom.

101
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,489
It's like when
you're a kid and you

102
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,050
need permission to
go to the washroom?

103
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,361
And you raise your hand, and
wait for teacher to call on you,

104
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,488
but meantime you
just have to go so bad.

105
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,170
Should've looked at his wallet.
But you just go!

106
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,248
Know exactly who
we're dealing with here.

107
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,483
You just go! You don't ask.
You just go!

108
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,844
Till then, hon, we stick to the
small roads, out-of-the-way motels,

109
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,285
and we just... We keep moving.

110
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,521
A road trip.

111
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,726
Wait, hold the phone.

112
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,044
Uncle Grady's got that hunting
cabin outside Canistota.

113
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,202
It's empty now.
We go there and hole up.

114
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,729
See? We're moving now. Things are flowing.
Not trapped anymore.

115
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,161
Well, I mean that was our home.

116
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,083
Yeah, but I mean, energy wise.

117
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,767
You know, I mean, you gotta
admit, we were stuck in the mud,

118
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,128
emotionally, I mean.
And now, we're flying.

119
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,051
We got a plan.
That's what matters.

120
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,248
We got a plan for
how to get outta this.

121
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,731
See it, then be it.

122
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,564
That's from Lifespring.
Except... Except the cops.

123
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,324
We gotta figure out...

124
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,841
We're gonna figure this out.

125
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,049
Right now, I just gotta
keep us alive.

126
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,486
You're doing it, hon.
We both are.

127
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,290
We're actualized!

128
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,570
Oh, I like it.

129
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,324
How come we've
never come here before?

130
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,366
You said Uncle Grady smelled
like athlete's foot. Remember?

131
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,521
Hon...

132
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,601
What? In case he gets feisty.

133
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,684
Good thinking, hon.

134
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,291
My tongue.

135
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,290
Bit off. What?

136
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,807
I bit my tongue half off.

137
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,325
You're dead,
in case you were wondering.

138
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,921
You and your whore.

139
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,525
Zip your lips.

140
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,410
Dodd Gerhardt.

141
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,771
I'm gonna have fun
taking her apart.

142
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,446
No.

143
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,922
That's good, yeah? Yeah.

144
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,682
I saw a little convenience
store up the road.

145
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,046
I'm gonna go make the call.

146
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,088
Oh, hon, there's
a phone in the bathroom.

147
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,523
Yeah, I'll use a pay
phone, make it untraceable.

148
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,451
Oh, smart thinking,
Ed Blumquist.

149
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,521
What are you gonna say?

150
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,041
Well...

151
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,043
You know, "If we give
him back to you,

152
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,010
you gotta promise
we'll go unmolested."

153
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,769
What if they say no?

154
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,611
Well, then, I'll show them
which part's the flank steak.

155
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,565
Yeah, it's...

156
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,680
Is this the Gerhardt
headquarters?

157
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,650
Good. Well, this is the butcher.

158
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,003
And I need to talk
to who's in charge.

159
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,531
No, not your butcher,
"The Butcher."

160
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,203
Yeah. From Luverne.

161
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,847
So lemme talk to
who's in charge.

162
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,011
I got Dodd.

163
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,761
You heard me.

164
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,850
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,850
What do you mean, a message?
Don't they...

166
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,891
I mean, I got Dodd.
Did you tell 'em that?

167
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,090
Just tell them I'll
call them back, okay?

168
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,442
Foot's on the other shoe now.

169
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,401
Shut up.

170
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,768
Oh, now, that's just rude.

171
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,602
Come on, for shit sake!

172
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,522
Hey! Ed'll be back any minute,
so don't get any ideas.

173
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,483
I got four daughters, you know.

174
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,410
I'm not a bad guy.

175
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,807
You called me a whore. I heard.

176
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,291
I swear to Christ,
when I'm free,

177
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,209
you're gonna see
the back of my hand.

178
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,083
We're gonna be
spending some time together.

179
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,810
So you need to be civil.

180
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,211
Go to hell.

181
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,401
Ow!

182
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,561
Bitch!

183
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,126
Bitch!

184
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,723
What did I just say?
Are you gonna be nice?

185
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,729
Yeah, okay, okay.
All right! All right!

186
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,721
Oh!

187
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,361
Good.

188
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,607
Now, I'm making beans.
You want some beans?

189
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,081
No.

190
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,325
No, what?

191
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,730
No, thank you.

192
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,006
That's better.

193
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,207
I gotta say, this whole thing
has just been...

194
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,604
And I mean, I'm sorry about your brother.
I am, but it was an accident.

195
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,082
And this whole thing
has just been so...

196
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,162
I mean,
I'm trying to stay positive.

197
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,881
That's one thing, if you spend
any time with me you'll see.

198
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,371
"Positive Peggy" is
what they call me.

199
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,963
But this whole thing has
just been super hard on Ed.

200
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,963
He's a little more
delicate, you know?

201
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,169
I mean, he's a big guy and
all, but deep down...

202
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,921
I mean, this whole thing has
just been really hard on him.

203
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,688
And it's my fault. I know.

204
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,291
I mean, I hit the guy,

205
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,244
your brother,
and I'm sorry about that.

206
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,446
I am,

207
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,281
but he was stepping out
into the road.

208
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,844
Didn't even look
where he was going.

209
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,922
No, no. No.

210
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,283
And so, Ed, you know,
all he did was clean it up.

211
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,770
And then you sent those
other fellas, and...

212
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,640
I mean, what were we supposed to do?
You know?

213
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,003
So now I'm hoping,
we're both hoping,

214
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,526
that we can just
smooth this all over now,

215
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,285
and everything can
go back to normal.

216
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,524
Oh, wait, now you said you
didn't want beans, didn't you?

217
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,122
No, it's okay. They're good, really.
Good, good stuff.

218
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,802
No. I mean, I should've...

219
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,247
Well... With everything
that's been going on...

220
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,331
And I mean, here I am

221
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,209
trying to actualize fully,
you know,

222
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,800
and I mean,
that's no small thing.

223
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,800
To review and reflect,
contextualize...

224
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,164
Not just keep
making past mistakes.

225
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,720
Will you listen
to me nattering on.

226
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,009
Oh, hey, hon, we're just...

227
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,565
I made some beans.
You want some?

228
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,324
No, it's okay.

229
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,484
What happened to him?

230
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,889
Oh, well now, we don't need
to talk about that, do we?

231
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,363
Water under the bridge.

232
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,649
Hon, did you stab the hostage?

233
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,245
Yes. Yes. No.

234
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,288
I mean, I had to teach him
some manners is all.

235
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,603
If we're gonna be spending time together.
And him so angry.

236
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,967
When we're the ones
who should be angry.

237
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,601
I mean, when you get right down to
it, it's our shop that burned up.

238
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,523
Help me. PEGGY: Our house
we had to leave behind.

239
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,206
She's crazy.
Keep her away from me, man.

240
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,050
Hon... Help me.

241
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,484
Hon, hon. Hmm?

242
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,200
They're not gonna want him back
if we cut him up too much.

243
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,725
Oh, I hardly stuck him at all.

244
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,881
I'm hurt real bad.

245
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,961
Shut up.

246
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,451
I think she punctured a lung.

247
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,649
How'd it go with the family?
They gonna negotiate?

248
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,482
Had to leave them a message.

249
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,642
Well, you said we had him?

250
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,530
Yeah, but it was just like
a flunky or something.

251
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,409
So I said I'd call back.

252
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,448
Okay, well, maybe there's...

253
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,000
Sounds like there's
a war going on up there.

254
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,730
Maybe they're busy.

255
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,641
Yeah, but, I mean, if he's
such an important guy...

256
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,451
Now, hon, don't...

257
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,522
Don't doubt yourself, Ed.

258
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,082
That was my undoing.
See it, then be it, right?

259
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,410
So just... Have some
beans and call back.

260
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,091
They'll be home
next time for sure.

261
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,446
Good?

262
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,406
Hon, you gotta
stop stabbing him.

263
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,851
Water.

264
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,449
Did you spit in this?

265
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,886
What?

266
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,290
Tequila. Pour it in front of me.

267
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,604
Here you go, chief.

268
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,843
Looking for a couple. Red-headed
man and a blonde woman,

269
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,809
driving a blue Lincoln.

270
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,405
White couple?

271
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,203
Didn't you guys try to start
your own country a while back?

272
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,485
Wounded Knee?

273
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,285
What happened there? Didn't you
feel like being Americans anymore?

274
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,051
Not from there.

275
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,043
Yeah, see, well,

276
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,687
I'm not sure I wanna
serve alcohol to a

277
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,808
man who doesn't
want to be an American.

278
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,604
How about a man did
three tours in Vietnam

279
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,082
and got a Purple
Heart and a Bronze Star?

280
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,125
Who? You?

281
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,765
You're welcome.

282
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,047
Where are you going, Geronimo?

283
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,043
You're gonna grab your
bow and arrow there?

284
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,724
I don't think his teepee's here.

285
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,801
No.

286
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,725
We're talking to you, shitbird.

287
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,564
Is that a teepee?

288
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,208
What are you doing, buddy?

289
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,844
Just wanted a glass of water.

290
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,571
Shitbird's thirsty.
Get a load of that.

291
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,404
Is he crying, Earl?
I think he's crying.

292
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,001
Fuck!

293
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,881
Whoa, now, hold on a...

294
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,083
I called the cops.

295
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,124
Freeze, Cochise.

296
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,001
Excuse me, Your Lordship.
I gotta go to the john.

297
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,051
Well, I can't risk untying
you, not after before.

298
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,802
Yeah, but I'm gonna pee in
my pants in a minute here.

299
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,402
Well, that's okay, I guess.

300
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,324
No! Look, I'm not gonna...

301
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,927
I'm not gonna pee
in my pants like a halfwit.

302
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,690
I got rights here.

303
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,569
He's right, hon. There's the...

304
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,041
What do you...
The Geneva Convention.

305
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,890
Are we talking
number one or number two?

306
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,641
What?

307
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,047
You gotta pee or you
gotta poop, I'm saying?

308
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,090
Jeez, kid. I'm gonna
blow a sack here.

309
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,685
Hon, you're gonna have to...

310
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,281
Help him with his pants.
I'll do it.

311
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,327
No.

312
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,771
No, no. No, I'll do it.

313
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,048
Hurry up! Hurry up!

314
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,601
Come on!

315
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,450
Now,

316
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,490
I'm gonna open
your drawers. Okay?

317
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,284
I can't hold it!

318
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,770
Come on! Well...

319
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,561
Yeah, don't... Don't pee on me.

320
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,685
Don't...
I'm helping you out here.

321
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,161
Don't look at me.
Yeah? I'm help...

322
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,647
Oh, sweet Jesus.

323
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,921
Done? Yeah.

324
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,401
Well, okay. I'm gonna go make the call.
You'll be okay?

325
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,131
Affirmative.

326
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,011
Hey, doll.

327
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,046
I got some Chablis on ice...

328
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,851
How you doing?

329
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,366
You know,
with a song in my heart.

330
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,406
Warm for March.

331
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,448
Yeah, has been, I guess.

332
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,921
No opinion required.
Just factual.

333
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,401
The hippies want you to believe

334
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,006
the planet's heating up because
of my wife's hair spray.

335
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,570
Yeah. That's...

336
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,122
I don't know about that,
but it's been warm.

337
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,571
Yeah, saw you here
earlier on the phone.

338
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,120
Yeah, we're down
at the lake there.

339
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,649
Having a holiday,
I guess you'd call it.

340
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,128
No phone at the cabin so...

341
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,007
Wrong time of year for a holiday.
Can't swim, can't hunt.

342
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,967
Yeah, it's been pretty quiet.

343
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,685
And these too.

344
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,647
Yeah, just you and the moose.

345
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,081
Yeah, just us and the moose.

346
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,802
Going crazy down there,
to be honest.

347
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,247
I bet. How about
a pack of cards?

348
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,324
Just 39 cents.

349
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,682
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

350
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,690
You know what? On the house.
For you and the missus.

351
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,206
Well, thanks.

352
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,607
It is you and the missus, yeah?

353
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,881
Say, what time do you
open in the morning?

354
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,924
Usually around 7:00, unless
I sleep in, which I don't.

355
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,482
Just between you and me,
if you could eat a rooster,

356
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,528
I'd have done it by now.

357
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,766
Okay, then.

358
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,285
Okay, then.

359
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,882
Stupid. Stupid.

360
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,448
Hi. Hi, there. I'm good, thanks.
How are you?

361
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,885
Well, fantastic.

362
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,726
I'm trying to reach the Southnik Hotel.
It's in Sioux Falls.

363
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,766
Ah, just the front desk, please.

364
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,730
Okay, great.

365
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,842
Hi. I'm looking for one of your guests.
Last name Heck.

366
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,769
Yes, spelled just like that.
First name Constance.

367
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,884
Okay, I'll wait.

368
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,241
Hello?

369
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,410
Oh, gosh, did I wake you?

370
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,891
No. I'm...

371
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,408
Where are you, sweetie?
You're missing the seminar.

372
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,364
I know, and I feel terrible, but
we're kind of in a little trouble.

373
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,365
You and Ed?

374
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,490
Yeah,

375
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,090
well, it's a long story,
but I'm dealing with it.

376
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,969
How's it going? What?

377
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,963
The seminar? Is it amazing?

378
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,368
Oh. It's...

379
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,329
You should come.
There's still time.

380
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,564
I wish,

381
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,446
although, I did have
kind of a breakthrough.

382
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,528
Like a vision, you know?

383
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,444
I can see things
a whole lot more clear now.

384
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,243
And I... Maybe I don't need
it as much anymore.

385
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,091
Well, vision's important, but...

386
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,084
Yeah, so I just wanted
to call and say thanks.

387
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,009
I know you paid
for the room and...

388
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,048
Don't be silly, the room...

389
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,924
I'm just glad you're...

390
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,283
And maybe...
I mean, where are you?

391
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,568
Maybe we could meet for a drink.

392
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,450
You could fill me in,
tell me about your vision.

393
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,487
Oh.

394
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,927
No, no, no, no, no. Better not.

395
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,729
I mean, we're out in the
woods here, not far, but...

396
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,531
Like I said, we had some
trouble and we're hiding out.

397
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,166
Ooh. Sounds romantic.

398
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,846
No. Well, sort of... Ed and me,

399
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,880
it's not been easy lately,
but we're coming together now,

400
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,769
working as equals, which is...

401
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,126
That's great, hon.

402
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,241
Mmm-hmm.

403
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,448
Yeah, so I should go.

404
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,330
Hey, you know,
there's all this great

405
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,562
material here as
part of the course...

406
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,563
Workbooks and the like.

407
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,564
And since you already paid,
I got them right here.

408
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,124
Maybe I should send them to you.

409
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,731
Oh, yeah!

410
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,650
Yeah! Real eye-opening stuff.

411
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,084
I mean, I've made more progress

412
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,891
since this morning
than ever, maybe.

413
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,886
Not sure how long we'll
be here is the thing.

414
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,204
Sure, but, I mean, mail
service is what, three days?

415
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,160
Well, yeah.

416
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,570
Just... No, no.
Can you hold onto it for me?

417
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,971
If it's not too
much of a bother.

418
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,644
It's no problem.

419
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,848
You said you were close.

420
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,491
I'll just... Where are you?

421
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,364
I'll jump in the car... And
wait till you see this workbook.

422
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,922
It's like a road map to
unlocking your inner go-getter.

423
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,367
I... We're... I don't know
exactly where we are.

424
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,967
I think south west,
near Vermillion?

425
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,963
The lake?
It's a kind of a cabin.

426
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,287
Well, I'll just...
Is there a phone book there?

427
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,804
A piece a mail?

428
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,089
I'll come over with the
workbooks and you could...

429
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,044
Like I said, I've made more
progress in hours than ever...

430
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,408
No. You're sweet, but, like
I said, we're hiding out,

431
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,280
so I'll just... I'll call you
as soon as it's over, okay?

432
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,486
I'll give you a call.

433
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,891
Yeah, but...

434
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,331
Okay, bye.

435
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,804
I tried. You heard.

436
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,009
He's looking at us.

437
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,249
He's looking at us.

438
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,481
Mmm?

439
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,481
Make him stop.
Stop looking at us!

440
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,088
Where am I supposed to look?

441
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,889
Just close your eyes.

442
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,765
I'm not tired.

443
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,325
I don't care.

444
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,041
Don't you do it.
Don't you do it.

445
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,121
Hey...

446
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,651
Thanks, hon.

447
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,005
God damn it.

448
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,481
And now back to
your South Dakota Morning Movies.

449
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,291
Operation Eagle's Nest
starring Ronald Reagan.

450
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,091
Okay. I'm gonna give it one more
go and not take no for an answer.

451
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,764
Go get 'em, hon.

452
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,922
We must hide! He's coming!

453
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,403
Marie, you must
make me a promise.

454
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,084
If something
should happen to me...

455
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,161
No!

456
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,401
Don't say it!

457
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,926
You must continue on without me.

458
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,647
No.

459
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,085
This war is bigger than us.

460
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,969
No. And our love.

461
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,281
No!

462
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,001
Smoke!

463
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,289
He's trying to force us out.

464
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,010
But we can't go out there!

465
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,091
And if we stay here we burn in our
little hell. We have no choice!

466
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,368
But they will shoot us down!

467
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,881
Us.

468
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,721
No.

469
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,850
Pierre, what are you suggesting?

470
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,286
What?

471
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,209
I will be your shield.

472
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,724
One of us must make
it across the border.

473
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,243
Take that, you Nazi rat!

474
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,410
Come on, hurry!

475
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,087
You're not
making any sense here.

476
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,448
Mister, I'm telling you
I've got your man.

477
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,806
I've got your
boss man, and you...

478
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,086
Well, you know what, sir,

479
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,209
I might just call over to the
other side, see if they want him.

480
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,647
Thank you so much
for your help. Bye-bye.

481
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,361
Fargo. Please.
It's the Pearl Hotel.

482
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,243
Hi. I'm looking
for a Mike Milligan?

483
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,122
He's with a party of fellas.

484
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,362
Kind of rough types.

485
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,645
No, ma'am, I am not a reporter.

486
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,930
He left his wallet
in my store the other day

487
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,401
and it's got
a hundred bucks in it,

488
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,126
so I thought he
might want that back.

489
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,846
Bag 'em and drop
'em in the woods.

490
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,651
We tell the boss
the Gerhardts got 'em.

491
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,761
Hello?

492
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,605
Mike Milligan?

493
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,761
Yes.

494
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,762
Today's your lucky day, Mike.

495
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,886
I've got Dodd Gerhardt in the
trunk of my car. You want him?

496
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,724
Sir, if I kiss you when we meet,
would that be inappropriate?

497
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,762
What? I don't...

498
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:03,046
Nothing. Just, well,
it's been a day.

499
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,602
But the fact is, I do.
I do want him.

500
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,286
The question is,
what do you want?

501
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,489
Well, I got
the whole Gerhardt family

502
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,210
after me and I need
you to make them stop.

503
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,247
Well, then I think you
and I can make a deal.

504
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,163
Well, that's good then.
That's real good.

505
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,241
Uh...

506
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,651
Meet me in Sioux Falls
tomorrow morning, 8:00.

507
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,001
There's a motel off
the interstate there.

508
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,642
Motor Motel, I think.

509
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,526
It's two stories.

510
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,846
8:00 a.m.

511
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,564
Yeah. And no funny business either.
You hear?

512
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,126
'Cause I've killed people before

513
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,804
and I'm not
afraid to do it again.

514
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,888
Maybe you heard of me?
The Butcher of Luverne?

515
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,849
I have heard of you...

516
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,641
And may I say,

517
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,326
brother, I like your style.

518
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,331
All right.

519
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,044
Well, like I was saying,
groundhog saw his shadow.

520
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,563
Did it seem like six more
weeks of winter to you?

521
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,450
Well, not that I'm
complaining, mind you.

522
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,929
I mean,
I'm just passing time here

523
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,606
till they carry me outta here toes-up.

524
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,971
Okay, then.

525
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,603
Looking for a redhead.

526
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,130
Well, not sure I can
help you there.

527
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,089
Redhead, heavy set.

528
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,690
Okay, well, there's a bar
a mile or so up the road.

529
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,923
You could potentially meet
a fat-type girl there.

530
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,604
Not looking for a girl.
I'm looking for a man.

531
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,164
Heavy set. He parts his
hair in the middle.

532
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,767
Look, this is a family place.

533
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,289
We sell motor oil and pop and,
you know, maps for tourists.

534
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,729
Get a lot of tourists?

535
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,566
Not so many, no. Sometimes
people on their way to Rushmore.

536
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,122
He's driving a blue Lincoln.
Heavy set. Red-headed man.

537
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,166
Look, if you're not
gonna buy something,

538
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,720
well, I think you should leave.

539
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,764
Yeah. You know him.

540
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,521
No.

541
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,886
Look,

542
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,924
all I know is a fella comes
in here two, three times,

543
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,331
uses the phone outside.

544
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,686
Redhead.

545
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,400
Yeah, heavy-set like you said.

546
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,643
One time comes in and
says something like,

547
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,363
yeah, "We're going crazy
down there at the lake."

548
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,203
See, this time of
year not much to do.

549
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,560
At the lake.

550
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,369
Yeah, we were just...

551
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,485
He wasn't agitated,
but that's what he said.

552
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,404
"We're going crazy down
there at the lake."

553
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,687
Even bought a pack of cards.

554
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,486
Okay.

555
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,607
Hon?

556
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,881
Hon?

557
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,331
Son, you got yourself
a woman problem.

558
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,807
How I know is, they been
plaguing me my whole life.

559
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,561
What's the joke?

560
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,962
Can't live with them,
can't turn them into cat food.

561
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,480
Personally,
I don't see the value.

562
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,928
All that talking,
and the mood swings.

563
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,963
It's the lack of
rational thinking,

564
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,327
which, brother, your bitch
has got that in spades.

565
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,727
See, the male in the species, he's
got the potential for greatness.

566
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,847
Look at your kings of old.

567
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,083
Napoleon, Kublai Khan, Sampson!

568
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,091
Giants made of muscle and steel.

569
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,884
But these women...

570
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,162
Even in those Bible movies you see it.
Delilah, and Scheherazade...

571
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,524
I wanna tell you
my own private belief here.

572
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,970
I think Satan is a woman.

573
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,010
Think about it.

574
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,284
With her snake tongue,
always undermining...

575
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,361
See?

576
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,248
What did I tell you?

577
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,370
No matter what you do to 'em, these
goddamn twats just won't stop

578
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,965
till you put 'em down.

579
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,531
Ed!

580
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,282
Ed! Are you okay? Are you okay?

581
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,251
Is he dead?

582
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,090
I don't know.

583
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,210
Watch him, Ed.

584
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,805
Yeah, my eyes are open now.

585
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,449
I could almost hear Mike Milligan
drooling over the phone.

586
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,406
He'll know what to do with you.

587
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,165
My neck.
Something, something's wrong.

588
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,329
Step away from him now.

589
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,162
Oh, thank Christ.

590
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,321
Get me outta here.

591
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,848
Sit down, both of you.

592
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,644
What if we say no?

593
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,921
Just shoot them, you half-breed.
I'm hurt real bad here.

594
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,249
I can't feel my legs.

595
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,842
Thinking of getting a haircut.

596
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,002
How do you get...

597
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,529
Something professional.

598
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,322
Shorter, like on
the sides and back.

599
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,407
Well, I mean,
you got the bone structure.

600
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,768
Jesus Christ, you mongrel.

601
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,206
Just shoot these two and get
me to a goddamn hospital.

602
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,488
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

603
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,686
Can you do it?

604
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,927
Huh?

605
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,162
Haircut. Can you do it?

606
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,491
Look, we thank you for...
Shut up.

607
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,165
Can you do it?

608
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,731
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,483
Lemme, just... Lemme...

610
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,411
Can you...

611
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,407
Can you sit?

612
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,247
And I'll go get the scissors.

613
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,449
Ed, can you make sure...
Our guest may be thirsty.

614
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,646
What?

615
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,601
Oh.

616
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,410
You wanna pop?

617
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,686
No pop.

618
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,284
I said, sit down.

619
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,767
Not sure how sharp they'll be.

620
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,444
No funny tricks. No.

621
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,726
I mean, you saved us
and we're grateful for that.

622
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,645
Aren't we, Ed?

623
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,168
'Course we are and...

624
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,607
You know, if there's anything
we could do to repay you,

625
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,125
you just...

626
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,808
Professional, you said.

627
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,929
Yeah. Tired of this life.
