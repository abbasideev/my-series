1
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,004
And so, we come to
perhaps the bloodiest chapter

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,527
in the long and violent history
of the Midwest region.

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,441
And here I'm speaking of
Luverne, Minnesota, 1979,

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,882
commonly referred
to by laypeople

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
as the Massacre at Sioux Falls.

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,405
Readers will know
that I've chosen

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,642
to file this case
as a Minnesota crime

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,166
even though most of the murders

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,641
took place in North
and then South Dakota.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,686
But I believe the key to understanding
this complex and nuanced crime

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,287
is to look at the butcher and
small-town beautician at its center.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,249
Ed and Peggy Blumquist

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,571
were just 29 years old on the night
their lives changed forever.

14
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,761
Not much is known
about Ohanzee Dent.

15
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,605
We have no birth certificate,

16
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,401
no tribal or family history.

17
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,123
He was the Gerhardts' man,

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,408
or he had been, until...

19
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,687
Jesus Christ, ya mongrel.

20
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,769
Just shoot these two and get
me to a goddamn hospital.

21
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,966
So, this is what
all the fuss is about?

22
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,161
Yes, sir.

23
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,164
Blumquist, Mr. and Mrs.

24
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,370
Took flight from
Minnesota two days past.

25
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,000
They don't look like much.

26
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,131
You don't look like much.

27
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,880
We're realized.

28
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,921
What? What's she sayin'?

29
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,406
Says she realized somethin'.

30
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,881
Realized what?

31
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,560
That you're up
a tree without a paddle?

32
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,369
It's a tri-state deal here, J.C.

33
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,971
We're talkin' bodies for miles.

34
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,282
Not just some dead
hooligan in a cabin.

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,721
It's a goddamn shootin' war.

36
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,330
Yeah, I know. We got 'em, too.

37
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,527
Organized crime?

38
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,486
What the heck are you doing here with.
. . With that one?

39
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,047
The eldest Gerhardt boy, Dodd?

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,601
He came to the house after Peggy

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,047
and she knocked him on his ass.

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,771
So, I thought

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,208
maybe trade him back to the family
and make a deal for us to go.

44
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,767
A fresh start.

45
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,601
We're on a journey.

46
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,321
Can we just...

47
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,650
While we're skippin'
down memory lane, here,

48
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,291
it's worth notin' that the
Gerhardt Indian is out there free,

49
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,885
probably callin'
for reinforcements.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,650
So, if I were us...

51
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,687
I stabbed him.

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,761
...I'd get them outta here.

53
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,127
Or cover 'em in bacon
and leave 'em for the dogs.

54
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,201
I stabbed him!

55
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,361
The Indian.

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,844
He wanted a haircut and I
stabbed him with the scissors.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,001
In the back.

58
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,761
Boy, she makes us
look like the gang

59
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,763
that can't shoot straight,
doesn't she?

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,081
Our beautician.

61
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,529
It's worth mentionin', you know,

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,204
in the spirit
of full disclosure,

63
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,201
my plan,

64
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,921
it worked.

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
I made a deal for Dodd.

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,410
With, what, the Gerhardts?

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,768
No, they wouldn't.

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,604
They said they
weren't interested.

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,329
Well, that's what they told me.

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,965
So, I called Kansas City.

71
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,041
You did what?

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,407
I spoke to this fella, Milligan,

73
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,970
and he said he'd protect us

74
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,561
if we gave him Dodd.

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,447
So, have a meeting
set at 8:00 a.m.

76
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,521
Where?

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,641
Sioux Falls.

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,961
They're comin' here?

79
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,569
Yes, sir. To the Motor Motel.

80
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,166
We need to get these two into custody now.
Where's the nearest precinct?

81
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,041
Tell 'em.

82
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,051
We can't vouch for the safety
of the precinct, is the thing.

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,443
What kinda chicken shit
outfit you runnin' here, J.C.?

84
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,521
Zip it.

85
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,846
I don't drive to your backyard

86
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,604
and talk about
how all your heads are flat.

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,484
What does that mean, you
can't vouch for the safety?

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,165
We got graft, I'm sayin'.

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,840
Money changes hands.

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,369
Used to be Gerhardt money,
now it's Kansas City.

91
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,531
- Corruption.
- Allegedly.

92
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,321
But...

93
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,965
Well, you bring
these two into custody

94
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,168
can't guarantee they won't hear
about it down in Kansas City.

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,006
And you know they'll send,
like, an army.

96
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,645
So, we take 'em north,

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,848
some place where people
got their heads on straight.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,001
My state.

99
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,521
My prisoners.

100
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,362
Well, wherever we're takin'
'em, we need to go soon.

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,569
I've been under siege once this week.
Not really interested...

102
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,687
There's a third way.

103
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,361
We wire the redhead,

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,601
send him into the meetin'
with this Milligan fella,

105
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,205
get the conspiracy on tape.

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,530
If we're lucky,
we bust the whole operation.

107
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,727
No.

108
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,401
Son, I'm lookin' around

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,448
and you're outranked here
nine ways to Sunday.

110
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,722
You can't... These two?
You saw 'em.

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,003
Well, they're doin'
better than us, so far.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,811
Yeah, okay, through blind luck.

113
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,644
They're not up to... Believe me.
Wearin' a wire?

114
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,326
They'll make the effort if they
think it'll keep 'em off death row.

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,841
Look, I've met this Milligan fella.
It's not amateur hour.

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,967
He gets one whiff

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,042
and Ed's dead before the time
it takes to blow your nose.

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,966
Thought you were Gary Cooper.

119
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,684
Turns out you're Betty LaPlage.

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,120
Say that again. All right, look.

121
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,088
You brought your
shit to town, son.

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,845
I'm just tryin' to clean it up.

123
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,646
And I say we
squeeze the lemons we got

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,200
and use the juice to
catch these big fish.

125
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,006
So, get with the program.

126
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,447
Kid.

127
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,928
Listen to me, they're gonna
offer you a deal, okay?

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,001
Son. Don't take it.

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,844
Tell 'em you want a lawyer. Make
them take you into custody.

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,843
What do you care?
I'm responsible for you.

131
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,366
We don't need your conscience. You're
half the reason we're in this mess!

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,487
Look, you're not ready for this.

133
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,607
Trooper, not another word.

134
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,170
You are not up to the task.

135
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,004
This is a war. Don't you get it?

136
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,361
I'm responsible for you and
you're breathing because of me.

137
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,521
I can't just leave you behind.

138
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,647
Son!

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,326
You're turfed.

140
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,722
Now, pack your shit
and get outta here,

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,610
or my boys are gonna show you what
a South Dakota necktie feels like.

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,007
I'm goin'.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,847
You've been lucky.

144
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,640
That luck's gonna run out.

145
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,801
This is on you!

146
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,450
That went wrong in a hurry.

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,201
You comin'?

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,961
No.

149
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,641
Good to have at least one
grownup here, don't you think?

150
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,801
I'm gonna call my boss.

151
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,324
See if he can stop this madness
on a bureaucratic level.

152
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,646
Worth a shot.

153
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,645
This thing's
officially outta control.

154
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,289
You two are in the shit
just about past your eyes.

155
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,441
Yeah.

156
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,845
But there's a rope in my hand.

157
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,526
Okay.

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,647
Do you want the rope?

159
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,326
Yeah, we'll take all
the help we can get.

160
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,241
Good.

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,407
Gonna let you have your
meeting with Kansas City.

162
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,246
Gonna put a wire on you.

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,081
What's that?

164
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,207
A recordin' device, son.

165
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,281
Are you stupid?

166
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,361
Hey!

167
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,688
Look, you get these Kansas City
boys to impugn themselves on tape,

168
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,087
and I'll talk to the D.A. about
pleadin' you out on lesser charges.

169
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,485
Well, I want it in writin'.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,130
Meanwhile, at the crossroads
separating Minnesota from South Dakota,

171
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,291
a different kind of betrayal
was taking place.

172
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,442
Yes, sir, I do think
that sounds strange.

173
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,486
Mike Milligan, the low-level
enforcer for the Kansas City Mafia,

174
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,289
was playing a dangerous game.

175
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,605
Just hours earlier, he had
been targeted for execution,

176
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,610
but he had turned the tables
on his killers.

177
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,291
Well, they never showed up.

178
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,522
And now,
in a desperate gambit...

179
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,410
I'm on my way, me and my man,

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,168
to collect
the eldest Gerhardt male.

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,763
He sought to rout the Gerhardt
family once and for all.

182
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,685
That's right. Dodd Gerhardt.

183
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,201
That's what I was thinking.

184
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,367
Grab him up,

185
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
see if we can't end
things this minute,

186
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,967
tonight, with a trade or ambush.

187
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,446
Well, thank you, sir.

188
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,526
I won't let you down.

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,481
Finished.

190
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,166
That's a beauty.

191
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,051
Go show your mom.

192
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,883
Sylvia's mother
says Sylvia's hurrying

193
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,801
She's catching the
nine 'o' clock train.

194
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,927
Mommy?

195
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,689
Sylvia's mother says,
"Take your umbrella,

196
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,089
"'Cause Sylvie
it's starting to rain."

197
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,251
And Sylvia's mother says,
"Thank you for calling

198
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,083
"And sir won't you
come back again?"

199
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,683
And the operator says,

200
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,291
"Forty cents more,
for the next three minutes."

201
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,566
Please Mrs. Avery

202
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,531
I've just got to talk to her

203
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,968
I'll only keep her a while

204
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,484
Please Mrs. Avery

205
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,451
I just want to tell her goodbye.

206
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,723
Tell her goodbye

207
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,046
Clerk's dead inside.

208
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,401
Car keys are gone,

209
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,086
looks like there's a red Eldorado
missin' from the parkin' lot here,

210
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,281
so, you should put out an APB.

211
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,601
Sir, I'm supposed
to escort you outta state.

212
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,045
No, son,

213
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,281
this fella that
killed the clerk,

214
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,648
he is wanted in conjunction with a
double-digit number of homicides.

215
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,562
Yeah, I don't know about that.

216
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,248
But Captain Cheney's
real scary, so...

217
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,842
I'm gonna have to ask you
to get in your prowler

218
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,803
and I'm gonna follow you
to the state line.

219
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,569
Car nine, come in. Over.

220
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,601
Go for Schmidt.

221
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,046
I got a Minnesota State cop on the
line lookin' for Sheriff Larsson.

222
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,240
Okay. Put him through.

223
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,923
Listen, he's in a red Eldorado.

224
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,881
Who's that?

225
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,527
The Indian.

226
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,647
Shot the clerk

227
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,524
at the convenience store,
the one who called him in.

228
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,010
Looks like our man
patched up his scissor wound

229
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,650
and took the clerk's car.

230
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,531
Yeah, kid, it's me.

231
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,128
We're headed... What is it?

232
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,481
The Motor Motel.

233
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,483
We're headed to the Motor Motel.

234
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,046
The plan is to
ditch the prowlers

235
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,522
and then hole up for the
night under a low profile.

236
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,647
And then, prep Ed for the sting.

237
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,881
Listen, you need to...

238
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,049
I gotta bad feelin'
here and they're...

239
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,051
I'm bein' run outta town.

240
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,371
But you need to
watch yourselves.

241
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,727
This thing ain't over.

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,001
Here, give me that thing.

243
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,641
Listen, Trooper,

244
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,967
we appreciate your giddy up
on this this thing,

245
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,042
but we're not fresh
off the boat, here.

246
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,000
If these fellas wanna tussle

247
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,481
they're gonna find
out a thing or two

248
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,284
about what a Dakota man can do.

249
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,841
Yeah...

250
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,605
Take a seat on the bench,
is what I'm sayin', junior.

251
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,842
We'll handle it from here.
Over and out.

252
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,683
Unload the prisoners, and
ditch the prowlers around back.

253
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,728
Hey, Captain?
Talk to you for a second?

254
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
Your man was outta line.

255
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,611
Yes, sir. Yeah. He...

256
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,926
He was havin' a feelin'.

257
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,686
This mess has got us...

258
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,250
You Minnesota
boys don't got much

259
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,810
in the way a backbone,
now do you?

260
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,811
Well, now, I wouldn't say that.

261
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,688
Just like to
think things through.

262
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,761
Army?

263
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,886
Yes, sir.

264
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,208
Liberated France
in the Great War.

265
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,441
Not singlehandedly,

266
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,568
but I like to think they couldn't
have done it without me.

267
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,211
Well, then you know it's the
generals that do the thinkin'

268
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,321
and everybody else
just says "how high?"

269
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,282
Not gonna debate
the merits of top-down

270
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,930
decision makin'
with you, Captain,

271
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,767
except to say, I had
a lieutenant in the war

272
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,127
and he told Eisenhower
to go to hell once,

273
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,771
on account of his orders
would have got us all killed.

274
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,645
I send that man
a card every Christmas,

275
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,727
'cause I can.

276
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,445
Stay or go.

277
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,561
Makes no difference to me.

278
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,643
But tomorrow, I'm takin'
the fight to the enemy.

279
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,286
Tell Simone to come see me.

280
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,885
I wanna apologize for yesterday.

281
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,410
She left in a hurry

282
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,241
when you were took.

283
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,331
Don't think she's back yet.

284
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,242
Sorry, Mrs., but...

285
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,884
What? What is it?

286
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,887
It's for your son, ma'am.

287
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,322
Supposed to talk
to him directly.

288
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,401
It's okay.

289
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,761
We'll go into the barn.

290
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,001
No.

291
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,527
No secrets here.

292
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,491
Well, what is it, kid?
Spit it out.

293
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,841
Your Indian...

294
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,890
He's on the phone. Hanzee?

295
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,047
Says he found Dodd.

296
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,681
Is he alive?

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,001
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,131
They got him,
but he's breathin'.

299
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,967
Who's got him?

300
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,921
Historians of the region
have long debated the next two words

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,407
spoken by
the Gerhardts' Native man.

302
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,840
When, exactly, did he decide to
betray the rest of his employers?

303
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,448
Yes, he had executed
Dodd Gerhardt in cold blood,

304
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,364
but at what point did he
decide to finish the job?

305
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,326
Was it here?

306
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,046
Or maybe earlier.

307
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,486
...you gotta do is
be straight with us.

308
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,321
I'm straight.

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,927
It's certainly possible
that the move was spontaneous.

310
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,410
Who knows, maybe it'd been
building inside of him

311
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,482
since Otto Gerhardt
took him off the street

312
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,925
when he was eight years old.

313
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,327
Whatever the answer,

314
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,610
when Floyd Gerhardt asked who it
was that was holding her son,

315
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,284
Ohanzee Dent said...

316
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,441
Kansas City.

317
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,925
That Milligan fella.

318
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,130
It was an ambush. Luverne.

319
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,242
Butcher grabbed Dodd,
fled the state.

320
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,801
Why?

321
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,562
I tracked them to
a motel in Sioux Falls.

322
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,086
They got numbers, but they're
not expectin' anything.

323
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,641
I'll be there in three hours.

324
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,401
No, ma'am.

325
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,448
You send Bear and a dozen men,
we can bring him home.

326
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,885
Are you tellin' me what to do?

327
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,127
No.

328
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,689
Just can't vouch for
your safety is all.

329
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,370
Three times I sent
men to do a job.

330
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,771
Three times they
come back unfinished.

331
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,881
I'll handle this myself.

332
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,761
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,001
We'll lay waste to 'em
in the devil's hours.

334
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,645
Wranglers and white tees.

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,321
Captain says we're goin'
undercover for the night.

336
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,807
Poker later if you feel
like losin' some money.

337
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,165
You better wear pants this time.

338
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,721
Aw.

339
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,047
Are we really doin'
the right thing here?

340
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,001
What now?

341
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,841
Anyone want tea?

342
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,361
No, thanks, hon.

343
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,487
Officer?

344
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,324
It's "Detective."

345
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,767
Sorry.

346
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,961
Did you...

347
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,087
Tea?

348
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,567
No.

349
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,201
Hey.

350
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,281
What do you think?

351
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,644
When he's sleepin',
we could just...

352
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,921
No.

353
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,525
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

354
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,087
None o' that, now.

355
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,241
Don't make me separate you.

356
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,161
Okay.

357
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,369
It's Ben, isn't it?

358
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,441
Jamin.

359
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,601
Benjamin.

360
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,488
And you're from?

361
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,401
Sorry.

362
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,246
Fargo, North Dakota.

363
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,048
I work for Chief Gibson.

364
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,920
Which one is he again?

365
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,361
Does it matter?

366
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,967
I guess not.

367
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,761
Thanks.

368
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,368
I don't wanna feel down

369
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,043
'Cause my name
is getting' around

370
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,847
I say the whole world
is letting me down now

371
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,449
'Cause I don't know
where I'm goin'

372
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,522
Yes, I guess
I'm going down, down, down

373
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,883
And I feel I'm gonna drown

374
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,728
Yeah, I guess
I'm going down, down, down

375
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,005
And I feel I'm gonna drown

376
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,726
Car 18, come in. Over.

377
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,561
Car 18. Over.

378
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,841
Solverson.

379
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,250
Yeah, just got a courtesy call
from Sioux Falls P.D.

380
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,610
Say they found
Constance Heck dead

381
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,091
in her room at
the Southnik Hotel.

382
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,330
Guess she went out
there for a conference.

383
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,841
You're kiddin'.

384
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,647
No, sir.

385
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,721
Strangled, they said.

386
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,964
I mean, when's all this
madness gonna end?

387
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,006
I surely don't know.

388
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,041
I tried.

389
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,721
You heard.

390
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,841
Yeah?

391
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,846
Just checkin' in.

392
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,561
I got 'em.

393
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,927
Not sayin' you don't.

394
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,682
Just want to go over
the details with 'em.

395
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,201
Explain their rights.

396
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,290
They know. I told 'em.

397
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,282
Son, I get the feelin'
you don't want me to come in.

398
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,565
All things equal, Pops,

399
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,803
we got a lot
a swinging dicks around here.

400
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,848
But, command's been delegated.

401
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,561
I'm in here, you're not.

402
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,921
Let's leave it at that.

403
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,884
You okay in there, Ed? Peggy?

404
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,289
Wire's secure and
no one's the wiser.

405
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,801
We got the upstairs room
bugged and ready for the meet.

406
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,921
Okay.

407
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,646
Move quickly and with
authority, Troopers.

408
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,841
That's lesson one.

409
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,961
Yes, sir.

410
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,041
Ice machine's busted.

411
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,241
What?

412
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,844
I'm just sayin' it's your show.

413
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,087
You've made that clear,

414
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,446
which means I'm here to observe,
and what I'm observin' is...

415
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,931
Ice machine's crapped out.

416
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,081
Yeah.

417
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,444
We bring this case in tomorrow,

418
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,009
and there'll be
commendations all around.

419
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,330
From this point on,
we're radio silent.

420
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,008
Motor Motel.
Motor Motel, come in.

421
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,604
Motor Motel,
this is Lou Solverson.

422
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,011
They're coming!
Do you hear me? They're...

423
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,331
When we reach the motel,

424
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,205
I want you in the vehicle.

425
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,560
Make sure you're safe.

426
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,520
Hanzee'll stay, too.

427
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,487
Okay.

428
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,561
I miss them all.

429
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,080
We'll be together again.

430
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,847
On high.

431
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,964
Best piss I ever took
was in a kitchen sink.

432
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,885
No wonder you got divorced.

433
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,290
I'm an outdoor guy myself.

434
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,766
It's liberatin', I think,

435
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,802
pissin' someplace
where you're not supposed to.

436
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,281
When I was a sergeant,

437
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,687
I pissed in my CO's desk
drawer when he was in Hawaii.

438
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,049
I drank six
coffees and a Nehi first.

439
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,690
Now, that was a good piss.

440
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,490
Well, you got
the hardware for it.

441
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,490
If that was me, I'd have had
to climb up on the desk.

442
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,207
Two rooms upstairs, three down.

443
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,007
Got Dodd on the bottom,
next to the office.

444
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,321
One man on guard.

445
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,530
Milligan's on the second floor.

446
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,761
Stay with Ma.

447
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,126
I like pissin' in the pool.

448
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,880
That's just gross.

449
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,482
Yeah, but, okay,
so why's pissin' in a pool

450
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,449
so much worse than pissin'
in a kitchen sink?

451
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,361
Screw this.

452
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,009
Well, first of all, son,

453
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,850
were there other people
in the pool at the time?

454
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,001
No!

455
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,001
Brother?

456
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,881
Brother?

457
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,001
All clear.

458
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,881
All clear!

459
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,521
Oh, Christ.

460
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,290
It's Rapid City all over again.

461
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
Brother?

462
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,441
They're cops!

463
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,285
No!

464
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,922
Then, as he killed
both friend and foe alike,

465
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,851
it became clear
that Hanzee was on a mission.

466
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,450
To find the beautician and her
butcher's assistant husband,

467
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,126
and silence them
once and for all.

468
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,490
Again, the question of why has
puzzled historians for decades.

469
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,445
It's true that they had seen
him execute Dodd Gerhardt,

470
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,760
and that they were
the only ones left

471
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,320
who could reveal his treachery
for what it was.

472
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,364
But maybe the reason was deeper.

473
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,403
- Professional, you said.
- Yeah.

474
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,566
Tired of this life.

475
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,522
The fact that he had
shown his true self

476
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,762
to them in a moment
of vulnerability.

477
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,401
Oh!

478
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,686
Gotta make a break for it, hon.

479
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,122
Are you... Are you seein' this?

480
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,810
It's just a flyin' saucer, Ed.

481
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,881
We gotta go.

482
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,486
Officer down!

483
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,164
I should have
gone home with you.

484
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,045
Turns out I didn't go.

485
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,361
Grateful for that.

486
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,081
What the...

487
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,401
Okay, then.

488
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,803
Yeah, all right.

489
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,284
Peggy? Ed?

490
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,081
On the run,

491
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,444
with the Indian in pursuit.

492
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,281
Go.

493
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,481
I can make it.

494
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,441
Dinner Sunday?

495
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,649
I'll be there in
a suit of armor.
