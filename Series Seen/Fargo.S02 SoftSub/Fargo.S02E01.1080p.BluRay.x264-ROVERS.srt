1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,011
Am I, uh...

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,568
What are we waiting for?

3
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,527
What?

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,243
The arrows.

5
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,130
Gayle's putting in
the arrows on Reagan.

6
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,290
Yeah, I know, it's...
But they said...

7
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,001
Jenny came by the trailer.
She said five minutes, so...

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,321
Well, there's a lot of arrows.

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,401
So...

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,523
Should I just go back to my.
. . No.

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,364
No, it's, uh... Jenny said...

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,249
What did Jenny say?

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,931
They're... They're
putting in the arrows.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,128
Yeah, I know, but how long?

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,085
Doll! Just find out, will you?

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,850
'Cause the chief
is wearing moccasins here.

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,809
It's goddamn February.

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,247
So, what's he like, anyway? Who?

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,607
Dutch, Reagan.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,162
Ronnie? Ah! He's a prince.
He's a real class act.

21
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,521
Yeah.

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,724
Can I get a blanket?

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,125
This is the actual field,
they tell me.

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,081
What? It's the
actual battlefield.

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,963
Massacre at Sioux Falls?

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,770
I think 300 of your people, braves,
died here, what, 100 years ago?

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,329
I'm from New Jersey.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,290
Sure, but...

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,646
Yeah, you're...

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,722
You're an Indian, right?

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,328
So that's gotta be, uh...

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,765
Gotta be what?

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,444
No, I'm just saying.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,084
This battle, you know, was the last
big battle before the end of...

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,128
And what came after...

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,481
Whew, look, I'm a Jew, so
believe me, I know tribulation.

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,805
Yeah. Smoke?

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,762
Any minute, he'll be out.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,161
Right. Nobody moves.
Everybody is still dead.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,128
It is a crisis of confidence.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,410
It is a crisis that strikes
at the very heart and soul

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,289
and spirit of our national will.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,169
We can see this crisis

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,050
in the growing doubt about the
meaning of our own lives.

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,686
And in the loss of
a unity of purpose.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,766
Is he kidding me?

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,444
...has
been taken out of the home

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,567
of John Wayne Gacy and...

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,843
The erosion of our confidence
in the future...

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,648
...is threatening
to destroy the social

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,843
and the political
fabric of America.

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,241
That's what I'm trying
to engage with here,

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,561
is this untapped
potential of yours

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,801
to sort of think a little bit.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,850
Confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,087
Hey there.

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,127
Sorry.

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,281
Are you kidding me?

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,447
You said noon, yeah?

60
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,806
Are you kidding me?

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,370
Now, hold on now...

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,364
I said 11:00, not noon. What?

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,725
Say that again. Okay.

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,847
Say it again.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,160
Okay, okay.

66
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,523
Where's the goddamn money?

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,449
Gave it to Ollie,
like, yesterday.

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,961
Don't lie.

69
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,964
I mean, I'm getting it.
It's just a little late.

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,804
The hell you say,
I did the rounds.

71
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,810
Everybody paid.

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,365
Of course
they're gonna say that.

73
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,885
So you got the money?

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,450
Well, you know, maybe I needed
it for me, for something I...

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,528
No, you earn for the family,
not for yourself.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,681
Yeah.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,923
But you're the oldest and then
there's Bear, and that's the throne.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,129
What am I ever gonna be except
the kid you send out for milk?

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,689
You're a Gerhardt.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,728
That's like Jupiter telling Pluto,
"Hey, you're a planet, too."

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,447
What?

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,802
If I'm this royalty,

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,249
how come you got me doing bullshit
collections like some nobody chump?

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,082
Everybody earns. That's the law.

85
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,289
Yeah, but what if I got
ambitions, you know?

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,091
You wear short pants
till you prove you're a man.

87
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,526
I'm a man.

88
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,291
You're the comic
in a piece of bubble gum!

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,447
Well, I mean, says you.

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,370
You got till tomorrow to bring
the collection money you owe.

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,768
Or what?

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,650
You make me wait for you
again, I'll cleave your skull.

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,640
This is
the month's cash, all in.

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,521
You'll see the problem
right away.

95
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,001
Light?

96
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,644
Mmm.

97
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,441
About time.

98
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,010
Give me a break.

99
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,609
Soon as you ladies
are done dancing...

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,523
You're right. We're light.

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,004
Even though the transport
dollars went up.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,768
It's the local business.

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,764
Gambling and drugs. And whores.

104
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,849
Aren't any good at this, huh?

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,930
Don't pin this on me.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,206
Or me.

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,841
We earned.

108
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,126
- But not Rye.
- No.

109
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,569
But even without his nut,
we shouldn't be this short.

110
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,325
It's like we're a balloon
leaking air all over.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,447
Spit it out.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,130
What are we talking about here?

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,282
Tell me, God damn it.

114
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,250
Another outfit.

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,763
I'm taking care of it.

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,846
From the south.
Don't know where.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,321
- I said I'd handle it.
- They're coming hard.

118
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,807
Son, I am the iron fist of God.

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,805
There's not a sane man in three
states who would dare to...

120
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,724
Some pissant crew
from south no-place?

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,004
You bring me these
hirnlose Mutterfotzen

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,242
and I'll grind their bones
to make my...

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,406
Otto?

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,881
Otto.

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,405
All right? Hear me.

126
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,409
I'm saying tomorrow has never
been closer than it is right now.

127
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,768
It's 11:00 in the morning.

128
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,363
Metaphorically, I mean.

129
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,246
Hi, friend.

130
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,681
Be with you in a... Check
never came is my point.

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,009
I'm owed for work I done.
Me and the boys, we're owed.

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,450
Giddy-up there, cowboy.

133
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,250
Wait your turn, short round.

134
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,601
What'd you say?

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,491
You heard me.

136
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,485
Jesus! Just, uh...

137
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,441
It's in the mail, okay?
The check.

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,650
Just... If it hasn't come by
Tuesday, I'll write you another.

139
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah, that's right.
You better run.

140
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,930
Come on now!

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,365
He could call a cop!

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,891
He's not calling anybody.

143
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,930
Guys like that, they're
just big on the outside.

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,769
So, where's this
miracle contraption?

145
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,450
Behold the future. I'm talking
money, hand over fist.

146
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,085
A typewriter.

147
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,687
A self-correcting IBM Selectric
Two electric typewriter

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,762
with patented
high-speed typeball.

149
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,171
They're not just
for women anymore.

150
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,845
And you're sure
we're the only...

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,922
Sole distributor,
Midwest region.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,325
Assuming you're willing to forget
certain debts owed to your family

153
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,448
from the, uh... Gambling.

154
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,444
Yeah, which, you know,
I'm not proud.

155
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,330
So soon as you talk to the judge

156
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,562
and she unfreezes the accounts,

157
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,530
well, then, we can turn
on the money spigot.

158
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,086
The what?

159
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,124
The spigot? It's like
where you hook up a hose?

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,089
Like a fire hose?

161
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,806
Any hose.

162
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,568
I'm saying once we get those typewriters,
the money, there'll be no stopping it.

163
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,730
Ah, which judge again?

164
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,841
People of the
Earth, can you hear me?

165
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,369
Came a voice from the sky
on that magical night

166
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,364
And in the colors
of a thousand sunsets

167
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,247
They traveled through the
world on a silvery light

168
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,526
You're the comic in
a piece of bubble gum!

169
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,001
The people of the Earth
stood waiting

170
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,371
Watching as the ships
came one by one

171
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,525
Setting fire to the sky
as they landed

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,607
Carrying to the world
children of the sun

173
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,125
Welcome to Waffle Hut!

174
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,361
Shit, lady. Table or booth?

175
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,044
Just, uh, the counter.

176
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,446
Special's tuna melt and fries.
Pie's humbleberry.

177
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,885
Just coffee.

178
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,762
Everything's
taken care of, I see.

179
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,326
Sugar?

180
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,571
Uh, ma'am, you're
freaking me out a little.

181
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,244
So, now he squeezes and the
mustard goes all over his shirt.

182
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
He didn't have another shirt
to wear, so...

183
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,129
I'm gonna pay up now. I'll
meet you at the counter.

184
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,371
How was everything?

185
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,930
Real good. Oh, good.

186
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,289
I'll get your change.

187
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,643
There you are. Thank you.

188
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,044
Hi. No.

189
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,641
What do you mean, "No"?

190
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,961
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying.

191
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,644
First of all,
I'm not selling anything.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,684
And second... You need
to make me another burger.

193
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,888
This one's a coaster.
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,970
Hey. Your Majesty.

195
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,051
You're gonna change your mind
about something. A case.

196
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,406
Or what?

197
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,685
Or you'll find out is what.

198
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,487
This isn't one of those optional
"check A or B" scenarios.

199
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,244
I'm gonna change your mind.

200
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,051
One day the Devil
came to God and said,

201
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,806
"Let's make a bet, between you
and me, for the soul of a man."

202
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,689
And from on high they looked down
on Job, a devout man, religious,

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,923
and the Devil said,
"I can change his mind

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,411
"and make him curse your name."

205
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,330
And God said, "Try and
you will only fail."

206
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,609
So the Devil begins.

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,725
He kills Job's herds
and takes his fields.

208
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,929
He plagues him with boils and
throws him on the ash heap.

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,243
But Job's mind
remains unchanged.

210
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,524
So I ask you, son,

211
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,687
if the Devil couldn't
change Job's mind,

212
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,167
how the hell are you
gonna change mine?

213
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,727
What?

214
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,044
You're a little dim, aren't you?

215
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,490
Listen, this is...

216
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,651
There's two ways this can go...
Is one of them the hard way?

217
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,370
Easy... You know what?

218
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,491
There's a fella who needs to get
his hands on some typewriters.

219
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,521
And you're gonna... Ah,
Christ, you're with that fool.

220
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,965
Yeah, you're...

221
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,800
Son, you have three seconds to pick
your ass up and get out of here,

222
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,644
or I'm gonna
squash you like a bug.

223
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,840
Okay, look, bitch.
I'm the one doing...

224
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,408
God damn, my eyes!

225
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,642
Now scram before
I call the cops!

226
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,767
Oh, crap.

227
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,611
Shit.

228
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,244
Shit.

229
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,605
Shit.

230
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,284
Shit.

231
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,207
"'Oh, Wocky, ' cried Joe. 'See
what you've done, Polly Pepper?'

232
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,210
"But Polly didn't hear.

233
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,049
"Over the big,
flat door stone she sped,

234
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,044
"and met Ben with little
David coming in the gate.

235
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,963
"His face was
just like Franzie's.

236
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,247
"With a cold,
heavy feeling in her heart,

237
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,567
"Polly realized
that this was no play.

238
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,563
"Oh, Ben, she cried,
flinging her arms

239
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,688
"around his neck
and bursting into tears.

240
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,411
"'Don't, please.
I wish you wouldn't.

241
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,130
"Franzie's got them
and that's enough.'

242
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,843
"'Got what?' asked Ben.

243
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,482
"Well, Davie's eyes grew to
their widest proportions.

244
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,843
"Oh, measles, cried Polly,
bursting out afresh.

245
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,209
"'The hatefulist,
horridist measles.

246
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,085
"'Now you're taken.'

247
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,845
"Oh, no, I ain't,
responded Ben cheerfully.

248
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
"Who knew what measles were?

249
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,963
"'Wait, now Polly, I'm all right.

250
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,044
"'Only my head aches
and my eyes feel funny.'

251
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,763
"Polly, only half-reassured,
gulped down her sobs

252
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,004
"and the sorrowful trio
repaired to Mother.

253
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,687
"Oh, dear me,
ejaculated Mrs. Pepper,

254
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,203
"sinking in a chair
at the dismay

255
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,249
"at the sight of Ben's red face.

256
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,322
"'Whatever we do now..."

257
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,290
This is a funny book, huh?

258
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,089
Yeah. Yeah.

259
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,401
Phone call, hon. It's the shop.

260
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,088
Okay, you. Sleep, huh?

261
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,009
- I'll be back in a minute to tuck you in.
- Okay.

262
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,807
Murder, Eunice says. Three of them.
Over at the Waffle Hut.

263
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,243
Hey, uh, you had
your thing today?

264
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,651
Yeah, this morning.

265
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,245
You feel okay?

266
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,281
Compared to what? Love Canal?

267
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,245
Hmm?

268
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,600
Solverson.

269
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,929
Yeah, okay.
Tell him not to go inside.

270
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,850
- Hank on his way?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,400
Called and he says he'll meet you there.
Have a good one.

272
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,130
Okay, you, too.

273
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,050
Gotta go, hon. You okay
getting her to bed?

274
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,329
Yeah, she's six.
Not, you know, Pol Pot.

275
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,561
Okay. Call if you
need, you know, whatever.

276
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,964
I left my rig there.
I hope that's okay.

277
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,246
I'm the one
who called it in, see?

278
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,201
Stopped for waffles, you know.

279
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,204
With the blueberries?

280
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,529
They come frozen this time
of year, I know, but...

281
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,008
I put my coat on her.

282
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,011
Seemed only right.

283
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,966
Yeah.

284
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,931
Yeah, it's okay
about the coat, or...

285
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,366
Yeah.

286
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,089
Well, this is a deal.

287
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,250
I count three dead.

288
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,970
Saw the waitress in
the parking lot? Mmm.

289
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,370
Think she caught one there,
then staggered out.

290
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,125
Gunman followed,
made things permanent.

291
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,604
That's Henry Blanton.

292
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,605
Got the single-season touchdown
record in 10th grade.

293
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,765
Thirty-one.

294
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,450
Still stands.

295
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,082
Yeah. Don't know her.

296
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,604
North Dakota plates
on the Mercedes outside.

297
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,690
Tourist, you're thinking?

298
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,326
Mmm.

299
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,725
How's Betsy?

300
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,011
You mean you didn't call
her before you came over?

301
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,085
Well, yeah.

302
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,001
Just being polite.

303
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,000
Give you a chance
to talk about your feelings,

304
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,770
should you be so disposed.

305
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,644
She's good. Yeah.

306
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,444
Ordered this kit of recipe cards.
Saw it on the TV.

307
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,450
So now every night, we eat
delicacies of the world.

308
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,610
Hmm. Some men like that.

309
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,845
Variety. Mmm.

310
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,006
She put a soufflé
on the table last night.

311
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,844
Perfectly good casserole. Then lit
it on fire with a kitchen match.

312
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,567
Huh?

313
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,003
Oh, which reminds me, you're
invited for dinner tomorrow.

314
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,204
6:00? Mmm-hmm.

315
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,448
I'll bring you a suit of armor.

316
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,971
Skid marks.

317
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,124
Yeah, I see them.

318
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,649
Of course, connecting those
to this deal here

319
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,564
would be what we call
jumping to a conclusion.

320
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,367
Based on the number of bodies,

321
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,522
I'm thinking we got one car
too many in the parking lot.

322
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,081
Yeah.

323
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,087
So, the shooter's got a wound or
two in him from the steak knife.

324
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,245
Two blood trails lead out, one
to the waitress, now deceased,

325
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,126
the other to the road here,

326
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,443
where he absconds,
leaving a few dollars behind.

327
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,721
Uh-huh.

328
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,482
Why not take his own car?

329
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,404
Unclear at this time.

330
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,449
There's a shoe in that tree.

331
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,645
There sure is.

332
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,447
So, uh, this a local matter
or the state police want it?

333
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,851
We do not.

334
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,766
Local matter it is.

335
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,763
Of course, any support
the state can provide...

336
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,490
Yeah, of course. Mmm.

337
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,080
See you tomorrow night, then, eh?
6:00.

338
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,129
Be ready for anything.

339
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,528
That's a shoe, all right.

340
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,325
Okay then.

341
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,121
Noreen?

342
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,601
Mmm?

343
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,610
Ed's leaving.

344
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,291
Okay then.

345
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,491
Oh, hey, you may as well
take these with you.

346
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,044
Boolie Hendricks paid,
but never picked them up.

347
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,451
Chops. Mmm.

348
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,611
Wasted meat's a crime.
Or it should be.

349
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,688
Okay then. Okay then.

350
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay then.

351
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,604
B-8.

352
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,690
B-8.

353
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,364
So, Ho Chi Minh...

354
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,207
Jesus, kid, keep up. Ho Chi
Minh was just a front man.

355
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,764
Enemy number one, straight
out of central casting.

356
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,487
AKA a stuffed shirt for the
military industrial complex.

357
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,246
The what's that now?

358
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,482
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

359
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,451
Ike's farewell address? The
military industrial complex.

360
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,881
Wheels inside wheels.
Special interests.

361
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,485
N-33.

362
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,403
N-33.

363
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,208
I thought there'd be
a band tonight.

364
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,882
- Boys. I-17.

365
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,328
I-17.

366
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,041
Balls.

367
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,883
Tell this dipshit pissant
about Ike's farewell address.

368
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,041
You mean the military
industrial complex?

369
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,044
See? He knows.

370
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,802
Of course, we've been to war.
Nothing complex about it.

371
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,006
How come you're in uniform then, Lou?
Didn't you work this morning?

372
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,320
Three dead at the Waffle Hut.

373
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,811
No shit.

374
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,611
Yeah, a real mess. Women, too.

375
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,930
Hank's thinking botched robbery.

376
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,805
Oh, sure. That's what
they want you to think.

377
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,366
Who?

378
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,561
They.

379
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,005
B-11.

380
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,924
You know, the powers that be.
It's a classic story.

381
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,607
Oswald acted alone. The girl
in the polka dot dress.

382
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,491
The what now?

383
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
The girl in...

384
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,521
After Kennedy,
the other was shot.

385
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,365
Robert, in LA.

386
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,681
People saw a woman
in a polka dot dress

387
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,491
running out of the hotel
yelling, "We got him."

388
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,403
But who do they arrest?

389
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,086
Uh...

390
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,049
- An Arab.
- Oh, yeah.

391
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,531
Racist pricks.

392
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,410
It's a diner robbery
in Minnesota, Karl.

393
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,284
Not a presidential
assassination.

394
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,006
Oh, sure, that's how it
starts, with something small.

395
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,647
Like a break-in
at the Watergate Hotel.

396
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,041
But just watch. This thing's
only getting bigger.

397
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,691
G-53.

398
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,810
G-53.

399
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,404
Well, I better get home.

400
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,811
Betsy had her chemo today.

401
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,007
God!

402
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,851
What is it, Karl?

403
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,730
It's just...

404
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,003
God damn.
Unacceptable is what it is.

405
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,481
A woman like that
in the prime of her...

406
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,804
With a young daughter.

407
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,845
N-40.

408
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,530
Tell her if John McCain could hold
out for five-and-a-half years

409
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,206
against Viet Cong thumbscrews,

410
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,851
she can beat this cancer
bullshit in her sleep.

411
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,168
I'll make sure to mention that.

412
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,924
I don't worry

413
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,727
Long as you're by my side

414
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,406
- Hey, hon.
- In the kitchen.

415
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,127
Boolie Hendricks paid for
chops, never picked them up.

416
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,851
So I figured...

417
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Hi. Hi.

418
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,728
Uh, hon, you're getting
blood on the tile.

419
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,609
Sorry, I'll put them
in the fridge.

420
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,331
Hamburger Helper?

421
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,044
And Tater Tots. Yum.

422
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,166
Should I...

423
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,606
Oh, hon. Don't.

424
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,330
I just got that stuff organized.

425
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,244
Yeah, but it's my chair.
Where am I supposed to...

426
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,368
Well, sit there, huh? Yeah.

427
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,171
I'll move that
stuff tomorrow. Promise.

428
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,529
Bon appétit. Mmm.

429
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,722
So, you think there was
an accomplice in a getaway car?

430
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,166
Your dad called.

431
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,606
You know him.

432
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,363
He likes to talk things through
before he goes to bed.

433
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,444
We got glasses.

434
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,203
Tastes different in a glass.

435
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,802
Molly go down okay? Mmm-hmm.

436
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,650
You know, I forgot earlier.

437
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,883
She made you something
at school today. Yeah.

438
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,809
She knows I don't smoke, right?

439
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,162
You could start.

440
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,803
Your dad said he'd be over
Sunday in a suit of armor.

441
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,011
Ugh, jeez. You light one soufflé on fire.

442
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,561
So, I'm getting excited
about this seminar.

443
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,127
The which?

444
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,646
You remember, hon. It's next weekend.
Constance is taking me.

445
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,600
Lifespring. Everybody's doing it.
Oh, yeah.

446
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,681
I really think this course is gonna
help me actualize, you know, fully.

447
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,361
Re-examine old reflex patterns.

448
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,601
The ones that keep
my life from working.

449
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,727
From...

450
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,724
'Cause we're doing great, yeah?

451
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,887
Oh, yeah.

452
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,883
I just mean me,
you know, as a person.

453
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,851
Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,086
Well, Bud asked again if I was interested
in maybe taking over the butcher shop.

455
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,606
Mmm.

456
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,571
Said he's thinking
of retiring end of the year.

457
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,961
Just had the end
of the year, huh?

458
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,407
Yeah, I guess
he means this year,

459
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,204
but wouldn't that be great?

460
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,081
Me owning the shop.

461
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,527
And maybe you take over
the salon one day,

462
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,247
you know, unless we got a
whole litter of kids by then.

463
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,124
Yeah, that's...
We talked about that.

464
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,563
We're trying, but it
takes time, you know?

465
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,768
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

466
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,401
Though, uh...

467
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,201
Hon...

468
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,085
"Trying." I mean...

469
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,722
Last time I checked, there's just the
one way to make a baby, you know.

470
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,164
Did that last weekend,
didn't we?

471
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,686
It was Bear Lake last weekend.
You said you didn't wanna...

472
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,127
Not with Kevin and Sally. Hon...

473
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,328
I just... I just...

474
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,564
I just love you, is all.

475
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,209
So, so much.

476
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,044
And, come on,
our kids would be amazing.

477
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,768
Oh, shoot. Here.

478
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,649
Hon, let me. No, it's fine.

479
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,370
I'm such a bumble sometimes.

480
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,845
What the heck?

481
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,288
I love you too, hon.
So, so much.

482
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,371
Maybe we should

483
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,365
maybe do it right now.

484
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,162
Here? No, silly. In the bedroom.

485
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,561
Come on.

486
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,570
Jeez. I better go see
what that...

487
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,445
We can... I'll wear
that nightie you like!

488
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,367
What the...

489
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,481
Hon?

490
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,051
Didn't I tell you?

491
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,290
I kind of hit a deer.

492
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,166
You hit a...

493
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,281
Well, you okay? Yeah.

494
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,931
No. I'm just,
you know, shook up mostly.

495
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,531
Jeez.

496
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,322
Well, insurance
should cover most of...

497
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,843
Actually, I think I need
to sit down, hon.

498
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,929
Can we go in the kitchen?

499
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,846
Heck, hon,
did you bring the deer home?

500
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,411
Hon, don't.

501
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,051
Hon.

502
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,205
Hon, don't.

503
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,247
Hon!

504
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,405
Come back. Hey.

505
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,641
Don't.

506
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,761
Jeez.

507
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,449
There's a...

508
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,443
There's a man...
There's a man in the...

509
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,605
Call the...

510
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,528
Call the police... Call the...

511
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,007
Oh, my God.

512
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,846
Oh, my God.

513
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,325
Oh, my God.

514
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,523
Hon? Jeez, hon!

515
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,849
Sorry. Are you okay? No. It's...

516
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm fine.

517
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,164
Who... You gotta believe me.

518
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,165
I thought he was dead.

519
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,241
What?

520
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,324
When I hit him, I thought he was.
. . You hit him?

521
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,685
You hit him with the car?
You said a deer.

522
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,726
You hit him.

523
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,570
Why didn't you go to the
police or the hospital?

524
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,889
He ran out into the road, hon.

525
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,010
What was I supposed to do?

526
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,291
Yeah, so you brought him home.
You made dinner.

527
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,727
Hamburger Helper.

528
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,004
I panicked, okay?

529
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,049
Yeah, well,
you gotta call the police.

530
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,366
- Why didn't you call the police?
- No.

531
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,481
- We gotta... Maybe he's not...
- No, no.

532
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,484
No, I... Hon, listen to me.

533
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,411
I ran over him! Hit and run!

534
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,881
And then you stabbed him
with a gardening tool.

535
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,247
The cops, do you think
they're gonna believe us?

536
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,926
I don't know, but people
are gonna look for him.

537
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,771
But, look, look, I was careful.

538
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,604
I drove the back way
all the way home.

539
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,202
You drove the...

540
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,370
Hon, a man's dead.

541
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,002
Look, that's why
we have to clean it up.

542
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,762
And tell people
I hit a deer, or...

543
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,240
We could run!

544
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,361
What?

545
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,722
Go to California!

546
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,961
No.

547
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,010
We have a life here, hon, a family.
I'm gonna buy the shop.

548
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,081
Okay then. Okay then.

549
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,207
Okay then.

550
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,324
And we're gonna start a family.

551
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,050
Well, start again, I'm saying.

552
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,761
I don't want to.

553
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,800
Okay, then...

554
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,322
Then, hon, look at me.

555
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,122
If we're gonna get
clear of this,

556
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,282
then we're gonna
have to clean it up.

557
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,809
Pretend it didn't happen.

558
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,328
'Cause if this comes out...

559
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,767
If this... Then all
the things you want,

560
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,006
that we want, that's over.

561
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,402
I go to jail,
and maybe you also.

562
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,609
And then there's no shop
and no family.

563
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,327
No kids.

564
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,001
Okay.

565
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,530
Okay then. We...

566
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,685
We clean it up.

567
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,320
We clean it up.

568
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,326
Well...

569
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,010
Should we call that Saturday?

570
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,565
Suppose we better.

571
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,683
She'll be up at 5:00 anyway,
wanting to play dolls.

572
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,843
And I know how fond you are
of your doll-playing time.

573
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,570
Good night, Mr. Solverson.

574
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,205
Good night, Mrs. Solverson,

575
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,043
and all the ships at sea.

576
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,611
Otto?

577
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,647
No!

578
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,611
Otto!

579
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,921
No!

580
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,641
No!

581
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,281
Otto!

582
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,721
Hold him!

583
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,884
Go out front! Go now!

584
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,043
Now! Otto!

585
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,050
Call a doctor! Go!

586
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,929
So, as you see on page 16
of the prospectus,

587
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,527
the main component of our
Northern Expansion Strategy

588
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,960
involves the absorption of the
Gerhardt Family Syndicate,

589
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,088
headquartered in Fargo, ND.

590
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,804
Now, the Gerhardts control
trucking and distribution

591
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,121
for the entire northern Midwest.

592
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,371
It's a family business started
in 1931 by Dieter Gerhardt.

593
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,843
Now deceased, and taken over
in 1950 by his son, Otto.

594
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,243
Now, not in the report, but
of relevance to this meeting,

595
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,687
old Otto had a stroke yesterday

596
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,241
on the family compound
in North Dakota.

597
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,124
Leaving who in charge?

598
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,166
Unclear.

599
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,289
His wife, Floyd, she's tough,
but, you know, a girl.

600
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,682
And then there are the three sons.
Dodd, Bear and Rye.

601
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,044
And of course, they all want
their shot at the throne.

602
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,129
Which the boys in Research think
provides a tactical opportunity

603
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,082
for us to move aggressively to
acquire or absorb their operation.

604
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,651
And if you can't,

605
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,720
and the current
business owners resist?

606
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,211
We liquidate.

607
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,281
Approved.
