00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,120
I pushed him.

21
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:07,169
You didn't push him.
And you didn't push him. Nobody did.

22
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,148
Ew.

23
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,858
It even scared me, Josh.

24
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,402
- It's gross!
- Aren't they supposed to be scary?

25
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,778
It's the whole point.

26
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,239
- They're supposed to be monsters.
- Mine's done.

27
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,158
- It got stabbed.
- That's disgusting.

28
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,076
No, you can't leave it like that.

29
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,913
Some gang member could steal it
and use it to stab a person in the heart.

30
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,624
Chloe, there are no gangs in Monterey.

31
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,584
I have this.

32
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,420
Come on,
draw a face or something.

33
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,214
It's gonna be total disco themed.
It's gonna be amazing.

34
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,884
It's gonna blow Frozen out of the water.
What are you doing?

35
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,887
- I'm smoking. I hate smoking.
- Nobody smokes anymore.

36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm just trying to manage my stress.

37
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,683
We're talking about Amabella's
birthday party. It'll be amazing.

38
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,060
How you doing?

39
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,270
How's everything with Ed? Is he here?

40
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:10,316
Um... Whether or not we're still married,
it's undetermined.

41
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,944
- Oh. Babe.
- Sorry.

42
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,988
I don't know. It's not just Ed.

43
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,158
I just feel like
everything right now is so fucked.

44
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,284
Yeah, it's a lot.

45
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,371
Everything's weird.

46
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,456
- What time is her party?
- Two,

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,001
because I have to go
to bankruptcy court that morning.

48
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,419
- What?
- On a Saturday?

49
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,213
Well, we worked it out.

50
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,425
It's better that we don't have to sit
around those penniless losers,

51
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,593
as though that's not us.

52
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,678
Jesus, I don't know
how you're still with him.

53
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,722
I know he's your husband, but...

54
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,349
- Fuck.
- I don't know.

55
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,432
We stay.

56
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,018
You don't have to.

57
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,895
But we do.

58
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,440
They betray us and we stay, you know.

59
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:56,362
They lie, they cheat on us, and we s...

60
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,573
- You know you said that out loud?
- I did. I said it out loud. Shit.

61
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,326
I just... We stay.
We work it out, is my point.

62
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,619
I'm coming!

63
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,955
Tell me to stop talking, please.

64
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,331
Just all the time.

65
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,418
-Oh, hi,
-Mary Louise?

66
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,547
The boys told me
you were having a pumpkin-carving party.

67
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,382
It sounded like so much fun.

68
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,260
And I... I can, um...

69
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,680
I can be gone in a flash
if it's an imposition.

70
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,682
Oh, no, no, no. Please come in.

71
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,852
- L brought a...
- Kids!

72
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,312
Surprise.

73
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,107
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

74
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,484
Oh, there's my little soldiers.

75
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:39,488
Aw. I see two handsome grandsons.

76
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,991
Somehow, I thought for sure
there'd be three.

77
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,325
Where did I get that idea?

78
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,828
- Oh, Ziggy. He's right there.
- Ziggy's over there.

79
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,496
There he is.

80
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,877
That's an intriguing jack-o'-lantern.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
He's shocked.

82
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,465
I think we're all a little shocked.

83
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,258
Have you met Bonnie, Mary Louise?

84
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,341
Hi.

85
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,510
Uh...

86
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,805
I don't believe I have.

87
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,765
I would certainly remember.

88
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,560
So beautiful.

89
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,811
Jane, hi.

90
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,521
Guess what?

91
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,690
I got a unit in your building.

92
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:18,027
- My building?
- Yes, it's perfect.

93
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,279
I'm just getting settled, so...

94
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,782
I can take the boys sometimes
for some stayover nights.

95
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,742
Yeah!

96
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,829
Yeah, you know,
SO you can have some time to have a life.

97
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,415
- Can I come too?
- Of course, all my grandchildren.

98
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,171
Mary Louise. Mary Louise,
can I have a word with you, please?

99
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,923
Yeah, sure. Of course.

100
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,593
I'm cleaning my pumpkin.
If you tap on it, all...

101
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,598
You really think that this is a good idea?

102
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,350
- What?
- Moving into Jane's building?

103
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,644
- Why wouldn't it be?
- Because there are boundaries,

104
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,937
Mary Louise.

105
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,272
Where would you have me go? Canada?

106
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,566
This is all beginning to feel
a little perverse.

107
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,402
- I beg your pardon?
- Moving in with your son's rape victim.

108
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,364
- For God's sake, it's not right.
- I'm not moving in with her.

109
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,157
We're in the same building complex.

110
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,786
- No. This...
- And by the way, I'm not as convinced

111
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,622
as you are, perhaps,
that she was a rape victim.

112
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,541
Oh, my God. I can't...

113
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,210
You know, there are many, many questions
that I still have.

114
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,046
For instance,
why was he even with her that night?

115
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,006
What was he looking for?

116
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,759
Perhaps seeking refuge from?

117
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,135
What's that supposed to mean?

118
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,471
How many other women did he go to?

119
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,973
If there's one...

120
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,725
there are others.

121
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,145
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,605
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,983
- No, no, no.
- I shouldn't have done that. I...

124
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,317
What shall we call that?

125
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,195
Foreplay?

126
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,364
Grandma.

127
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,949
Oh, dear.

128
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,092
- What's all this?
- Pumpkin-carving project.

129
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,511
The school decided
to celebrate Halloween this week.

130
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,638
God forbid they wait
till the end of the month.

131
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:13,517
I swear everyone in this town is obsessed
with first and better and most.

132
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,437
Speaking of which, it's Amabella's
birthday disco party tomorrow.

133
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,397
It's not even her fucking birthday.

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,317
I mean, is it too much to ask people
to check people's calendars

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,110
and then get back to them accordingly?

136
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,738
We all have calendar apps
on our phone, for God's sake.

137
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,241
What? Why are you staring at me?

138
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,325
Um...

139
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,206
There's never any middle ground with you.

140
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,711
Like, when you're upset, it's charge.
Full speed ahead.

141
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,506
If there's a problem, charge.

142
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,263
If there was a problem with us,
where was the charge?

143
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,684
Why couldn't you come straight at me
like you go at everyone else?

144
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,565
There wasn't a problem with us, Ed.
There's a problem with me.

145
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,178
Okay.

146
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,098
Oh, and it is a disco party, so...

147
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,142
And costumes may
or may not be required.

148
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,270
So the opportunity
for embarrassment is huge?

149
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,898
- Yeah.
- Ready?

150
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,191
Okay. Come on.

151
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,821
Got you.

152
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,535
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,298
- Do you wanna start or should 1?
- Yeah, I'll start.

154
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,553
I'm worried about the boys.

155
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,057
- Because?
- Because. Because...

156
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,019
you seem unwell.

157
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,438
Erratic.

158
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm fine.

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,193
You hit me.

160
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,113
And I apologized for that.

161
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,823
I've...

162
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,991
You snapped.

163
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,876
It's meant to be shared, you know.

164
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,711
Grief.

165
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,004
It's...

166
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,634
insurmountable.

167
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,389
Too difficult a battle to be waged alone.

168
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,436
Which is what you had to do.

169
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,064
You were alone after the accident.

170
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,483
Your husband left.

171
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,528
Perry told me.

172
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,531
Yes, he blamed me.

173
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,949
And he left.

174
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,204
And I deserved the blame.

175
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,997
To be left.

176
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,290
You know, Ray...

177
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,126
made a new life.

178
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,545
He got a new family.

179
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,465
He became a devoted father, so I'm told.

180
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,342
It's... It's good.

181
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,428
People can move on after tragedy,

182
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,597
just not together sometimes.

183
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,774
What do you think
about going to Big Sur?

184
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,192
Just the two of us.

185
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,030
There's a couples' thing.

186
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,991
It's a... It's a workshop.
A couples' workshop.

187
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,703
I know, I know, that sounds awful,
but it's gotta be better than that lady,

188
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,122
and it's supposed to be amazing.

189
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,212
"Madeline, I would love
to go with you into the woods

190
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,464
and talk about my feelings
and make love to you."

191
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,341
No?

192
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,137
Mom, can you look over my project?

193
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,514
Yeah.

194
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,974
This is opposites.

195
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,976
And next, we're gonna do synonyms.

196
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,477
Okay. Opposites.

197
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,812
- That's a door.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,397
- And that is...
- That's you.

199
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,690
Me. Of course.

200
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,149
Uh...

201
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,818
I don't... I don't understand.

202
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,195
The door's hinged.

203
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,534
I see. Is that supposed to be funny?

204
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,536
Well, my teacher wants imagery.

205
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,955
Not words like "hot" and "cold."

206
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,038
Uh-huh.

207
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,126
I'll change it.

208
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,420
Ah.

209
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,591
So is this the party line around here?
That I'm unhinged?

210
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,093
- That's the book on me?
- Pretty much.

211
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,512
Great.

212
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,061
I don't understand
why the attorney can't handle this.

213
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,187
Because they can't.

214
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,649
All right? He had to pluck a zillion
strings to get this through on a Saturday

215
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,817
with nobody else around.

216
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,492
It's not like a scarlet letter.
People file for bankruptcy all the time.

217
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,119
Some even go on to become president.

218
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,122
Let's just keep this thing moving along.
I've got a party to throw.

219
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:32,377
Absolutely no mention of that whatsoever
to the trustee. All right? Am I clear?

220
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,089
So this represents your assets
in their entirety?

221
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,050
- Yes, sir.
- Condo in Aspen.

222
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,261
Four-bedroom vacation home
in Palm Beach,

223
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,306
including a 58-foot Red Sea Yacht.

224
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,390
The Amabella.

225
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,517
Any other recreational
or vacation home?

226
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,102
No, sir.

227
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,855
Estimated liability is $33 million?

228
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,066
Yes, but most of that
is pending civil lawsuits,

229
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,443
and we expect to be able to settle
within that range.

230
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,364
You really don't get to settle anything
anymore, Mr. Klein. That all falls on me.

231
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,201
Your residence has been listed for sale?

232
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,579
- Uh, yes. We expect it to go for north of 20.
- At least.

233
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,873
Again, my decision, not yours.

234
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,959
Any other legal actions pending?

235
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,251
Uh, right to sue?

236
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,463
- Any punitive judgments in your favor?
- No, sir.

237
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,049
Any expectation of inheritance
in the next 18 months?

238
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,132
No, sir.

239
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,219
Parents in good health?

240
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,223
- Are you serious?
- Uh...

241
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,058
Yes, they're in good health.

242
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,232
Do you stand to inherit?

243
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,985
I'm self-made.

244
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,872
I see a charge for $4200
to Morris-Simmons Lab.

245
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,753
Can anybody tell me what that's for?

246
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,838
Medical.

247
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,842
- Did you submit to insurance?
- No.

248
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:02,925
Why not?

249
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,929
Because it's...

250
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,932
It wouldn't be declared as insurance.

251
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,018
Well, what is it?

252
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,186
It's medical.

253
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,356
Like I said the first time.

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,151
I don't think you follow here, Mrs. Klein.

255
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,321
See, this is a bankruptcy hearing.

256
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,282
And I can deny your petition.

257
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,119
Renata...

258
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,670
From dealing with men like you
all my life. Okay?

259
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,299
Mm-hm.

260
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,637
Going forward, disallow.

261
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,058
I have here a listing of your jewelry,

262
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,477
which doesn't include
that Rolex watch you're wearing.

263
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,853
I'll take it.

264
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,230
- You mean mine?
- Are you kidding?

265
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,150
- John, come on.
- It doesn't include that either.

266
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,236
- That's my wedding ring.
- It's not listed.

267
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,365
I'm... I'm not...

268
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,412
- giving my...
- I will handle this later.

269
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,594
We done here?

270
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,848
- How did you get here today?
- We drove.

271
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,266
Personal car?

272
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,894
Tesla, 2017.

273
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,564
- At least we got your ring back.
- Shut up.

274
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,320
There will come a day
that you will pay for this, Gordon.

275
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:50,367
But today is not that day.

276
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,829
Today is Amabella's day,

277
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:58,250
and it will be filled with laughter

278
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,585
and magic

279
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,422
and pure, unmitigated joy.

280
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,647
- Hi!
- Welcome to Club Amabellal

281
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,234
- You look incredible. You look...
- Oh, thank you.

282
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,571
- This is my mom, Elizabeth. This is Renata.
- Elizabeth! Renata.

283
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,698
- We have never met.
- No, we have not.

284
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,450
It's such a pleasure,
and thank you so much for inviting me.

285
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,077
Of course.

286
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,954
I mean, The Trammps?

287
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,622
And they're headlining.

288
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,667
- So amazing.
- Come in. Get champagne.

289
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,836
Hi.

290
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,880
Have a wonderful time.

291
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,048
Ziggy Stardust, ladies and gentlemen.

292
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,343
- This is Corey Brockfield.
- I've heard so much about you.

293
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,847
It's so great to meet you, Corey.
Welcome to my home.

294
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,974
- No, hi. Bonnie.
- Hi.

295
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,810
- Nice to meet you.
- Gordon. Get him some champagne.

296
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,854
I can't. He's so cute,
I can't even take it.

297
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,064
- I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Just don't tell him.

298
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,399
- Get on that.
- He's so cute.

299
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,026
You guys have to be cool.

300
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,612
- I made the biggest mistake bringing him.
- I'm never cool.

301
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,322
But I will try my best. For you.

302
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,408
For you, I'm about to be cool
for the first time in my life.

303
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,082
Are we gonna dance again? That's right.
We always need a dance party, don't we?

304
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,792
Hi, how are you?

305
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:30,550
Uh, this is a list of all
of the best family law attorneys

306
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,510
in the Bay Area,

307
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,346
as well as the peninsula.

308
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,849
I would like you to call each one of them.

309
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,435
But I have you. Wha...?

310
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,646
Why do I need to call them?

311
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,608
Well, you won't,
but your daughter-in-law will,

312
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:52,030
and if you call them first,
you know, she can't have them.

313
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,740
They'll be conflicted out.

314
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,411
It's... You know, it's an ugly process.

315
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,166
Are you really sure
you wanna proceed with this?

316
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,088
He agreed to go to a sauna center.

317
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,091
It's like a healing institute
for mature couples.

318
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,551
- Yeah, right.
- Maybe it used to be a...

319
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,138
Celeste, what exactly
does your mother-in-law know?

320
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,933
She gave me a very strange look yesterday.

321
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,519
If anything, she's suspicious of me.

322
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,521
Does that bother you, all that suspicion?

323
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,439
It does bother me. It does.

324
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,859
And if I could do it again, I wouldn't lie.
I wouldn't go along with the lie.

325
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,860
Exactly.

326
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,905
Hold on a second.
What are you trying to say?

327
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,617
You were the one that said
that he slipped, that he fell, and...

328
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,703
I mean, we went along with it.

329
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,789
- Are you blaming me?
- I blame myself, all right?

330
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,251
It seemed like a good idea at the time,
but I was numb.

331
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,795
I wasn't thinking straight,
and let's face it,

332
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,257
this fucking lie has
had quite a shelf life.

333
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,050
- Yeah, I agree.
- Wow.

334
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,844
You're talking about me
behind my back?

335
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,512
- You're blaming me.
- No. No.

336
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,099
- No, that's rich. That's really rich.
- We're not blaming you behind your back.

337
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,810
We're right here. It's to your face.

00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,932
But, I mean, do you think
there's any chance

347
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,311
that you'll be able
to forgive me eventually?

348
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,397
It's not about you, Gordon.

349
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,649
It's not?

350
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,652
Since I was old enough to dream
of having my own family,

351
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,989
I've been, in my head,
planning my child's life.

352
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,950
What it would entail,
what she would have,

353
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,537
the opportunities I could give her.

354
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,750
So I'm having a difficult time reconciling

355
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,877
that all my dreams have gone to shit.

356
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,256
All my hopes and plans for Amabella
have gone to shit.

357
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,885
I married a man...

358
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:25,683
who would take my life
and all my accomplishments

359
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,519
and just turn them to shit.

360
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,398
That... That's on me. Right?

361
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,358
My choices. My stupidity.

362
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,735
It's my picker that's broken.

363
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,821
- My fucking bad.
- Renata!

364
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,198

Uh... You don't need to read that all here.

423
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:14,912
You can just give it a good proof tonight
to make sure there are no inaccuracies.

424
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:17,415
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

425
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,375
So you do realize that once we file,

426
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,920
you can count on being, uh, alienated
from the boys.

427
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:27,133
I mean,
you might get custody, but affection...

428
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,302
This isn't about me needing to be liked.

429
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,929
Okay, everyone needs to be liked.

430
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,557
I find that's especially true
with grandmothers.

431
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,103

00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,772

was sensitive and...

kind.

00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,413
- Oh, my gosh. Amazing.
- You better not be lying to me.

00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,916
I'm not lying, I also wanna borrow
your dress. Is that weird?

Uh, no. You own it.

472
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,504

- That was insane.

473
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,380
- Disco was genius.
- Really?

474
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,674

- It was. It was so great.

475
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,761
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.
- For you. We've got one for you.

476
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,888
I know someone had a great time.

477
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,306
- I had a ball.
- That... Oh, no.

Oh, my God. Mom.

487
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,372
- Oh, my God. Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Watch her head. Watch her head.

488
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,667
- Oh, my God! Somebody call 911!
- What is happening to her?

489
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,555
So, what happened?

490
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:04,433
She had a stroke,
which most likely caused the seizure.

491
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:08,396
We're gonna take her into surgery now
and clean out a carotid artery in her neck.

492
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:11,357
It's good that you got her here so quickly.

493
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,317
As soon as we know more,
I'll let you know.

494
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,528
She just dropped like a stone.

495
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,709
I seriously thought she was gonna die.

496
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,672
It really makes you take stock of things.

497
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,596
You okay?

498
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,014
No.

499
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,684
I'm far from okay.

500
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,937
Look, if you're gonna leave me,
can you just do it?

501
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,439
Can you just get it over with?

502
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,109
Wh... I mean, I'm still here, aren't I?

503
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,861
Is that what you think, Ed?

504
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,196
You're far from here.

505
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,116
You're not even fucking close.

506
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,758
I had a really weird thing happened earlier
when I was dancing with Corey. Um...

507
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,553
Everything was going fine, it was great,
and then he moved his hand,

508
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:28,601
and my mind froze, and my body recoiled
and kind of had this spasm.

509
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,355
It's really frustrating
because I'm doing so well,

510
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,815
and then something like that happens.

511
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,735
And it's like,
am I ever gonna be able to be sexual again?

512
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,236
Can you relate to that?

513
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,322
Did he ever...

514
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,785
Did Perry ever rape you?

515
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,078
How we doing?

516
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,788
Another round?

517
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,165
No, I'm good. Thank you, actually.

518
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,876
It'll happen.

519
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,963
- So he didn't?
- No.

520
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,757
No, he didn't.

521
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:07,139
I'm gonna swing by the hospital on my way
and just check up on Bonnie.

522
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:11,894
Would you tell her that my boys
are with Mary Louise tonight, so if she...

523
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,854
If she wants anything, I'm here.

524
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,232
Ugh. Okay.

525
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,276
- Bye.
- Love you.

526
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
Love you.

527
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,366
So, what's it gonna be?

528
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,452
- Oh, what the hell, I'll have another one.
- Good choice.

529
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,550
Looking for Elizabeth Howard.

530
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,344
- She's right through there.
- Dad.

531
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,184
- Hi.
- Hi.

532
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,106
- She okay?
- I think.

533
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,817
What'd the surgeon say?

534
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,612
Her brain scans showed some bleeding,
but, um, it's minimal,

535
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,657
so we won't know anything else
till she wakes up.

536
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,498
Did you say something to her?

537
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,667
Before the incident,
did you say something?

538
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,878
- You mean, did I cause this?
- I didn't mean that.

539
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,129
Yeah, you did.

540
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:24,341
It's just that you know
how easily upset she gets.

541
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,801
I didn't cause her fucking stroke.

542
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,345
Calm down.
What if she can hear you?

543
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,098
Okay.

544
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,103
I'm gonna let you sit with her for a while.
Okay?

545
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:47,823
I'm here, baby.

546
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:52,995
It's the best pizza in the world!

547
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,623
That's what your dad used to say.

548
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:59,043
When he was your age. You know that?

549
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,378
- He said that with us too.
- He did?

550
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,631
Did he teach you
how to stretch the cheese?

551
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,967
- Yeah.
- Stretch the cheese.

552
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,219
Mm-hm.

553
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,181
Nothing better in the world.

554
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,601
If Dad was here,
he would eat a whole pizza to himself.

555
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,524
He is. He is here, in a way.

556
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,528
You know, people are never really gone.

557
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,283
Because they live on in the hearts
of those they leave behind.

558
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:35,246
We just have to keep your dad here.

559
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,790
In your hearts.

560
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,873
Right?

561
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,792
Right?

562
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,255
It's the best pizza in the world.

563
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,279
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

564
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,624
- Seriously?
- Excuse me?

565
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,418
- What the fuck?
- Bonnie. Hey.

566
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:07,462
Sorry.

567
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,007
She chooses now?

568
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,468
No, no, she's here for some DUI fatality
or something.

569
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,013
I ran into her downstairs.
It's something else.

570
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,475
- She's just a daughter of a patient.
- I know who she is.

571
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,775
I so wanted to bring the boys
to church, but Max was adamantly opposed.

572
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,778
He thinks that God is a douchebag.

573
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,529
His language, not mine.

574
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,989
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, Mommy.

575
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,241
- Hi.
- You all right?

576
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,326
Yeah, I'm fine.

577
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,870
- Just didn't sleep very well, you know?
- Yeah.

578
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,413
We had pulled pizza.

579
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,497
- Did you?
- Yeah.

580
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,792
Yeah. We stretched the cheese
like Daddy used to do.

581
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,670
Well, that sounds really fun.

582
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,589
And we saw Ziggy this morning.
He lives in Grandma's building.

583
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,133
Mm.

584
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,302
- Great.
- What's the matter?

585
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,762
Celeste, what's wrong?

586
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,975
I just... I don't know,
I feel like I'm coming down with something.

587
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,061
- Hmm?
- I just feel like very zonked.

588
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,562
You look funny.

589
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:06,897
Mm.

590
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,148
No fever.

591
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,611
What a mess.

592
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,739
- Good Lord.
- Hey.

593
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,118
How we all doing?

594
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,078
I gotta...

595
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,665
Hey, buddy.

596
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,169
And who do we have with us today?

597
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,379
I'm... I'm Joe.

598
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,672
- Hi.
- Hi.

599
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,755
Sorry.

600
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,760
So...

601
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,890
Shall we...

602
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,476
Let's get clean, shall we?

603
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,416
Wait, did you take Ambien again?

604
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,626
And you didn't even remember
he was in the house?

605
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,214
I couldn't... I didn't even realize where I
was when they came running in, I just...

606
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:16,800
Look, you're entitled
to have a private life.

607
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,595
She said she was taking the boys
for a sleepover.

608
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,930
I know, she comes in at a...
It must have been like...

609
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,308
Yeah, she should have called you first
or texted you.

610
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,143
You can't barge in on people like that.

611
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,687
I dropped the boys off at Jane's,
if that's all right.

612
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:34,068
So that we could have a conversation.

613
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,528
Is that your hint for me to leave?

614
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:41,824
Okay.

615
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,621
- It's all right. Mm-hm.
- Okay, I'll call you later.

616
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:55,672
Celeste...

617
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:01,470
I do think you need to take some...

618
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,305
Some real time to heal,

619
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:11,063
and that while you do that,
I think Max and Josh should reside with me.

620
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,774
No.

621
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,275
No.

622
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,027
- That won't be necessary.
- No, I...

623
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,571
I think it is ne... It is necessary.

624
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:23,242
- Look, last night was a misunderstanding...
- No, no, this is not about last night.

625
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,661
It's about a whole totality of events.

626
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,291
You're a mess, Celeste.

627
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,252
And until you're better,

628
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:37,423
we just have to think about
protecting the well-being of our boys.

629
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:40,843
We should at least
be able to agree on that. Hmm?

630
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,928
My boys will not be going
to live with you.

631
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:46,849
But they're at risk here.
They're at risk in your care.

632
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,768
And I'm their grandmother,
and I will not forsake them,

633
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:54,148
and I will not forsake what I know
Perry would want me to do for them.

634
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,358
I need you to get out of here.

635
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,110
- Right now.
- We can calmly...

636
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,611
No, no.

637
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,488
- Celeste...
- Get the fuck out of here!

638
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,741
Okay, I'm going to give you this
as a courtesy.

639
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,493
- What?
- It's a...

640
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,703
- What is it?
- A petition

641
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,163
- No.
- For assignment

642
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,290
- of the guardian of the person. Persons.
- What?

643
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,875
- It's plural in this case.
- What?

644
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,462
It'll be filed in the Monterey County
Superior Court tomorrow morning.

645
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,964
We need to do what's best for the boys.

646
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,931
- She could really lose her kids?
- Maybe.

647
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,350
It's California law, and it's very tricky.

648
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,519
- You got her a good lawyer.
- Good. She's good.

649
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:37,649
But I would have had her hire Ira Farber,
and now I hear Mary Louise got him,

650
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,277
- and that's why he was unavailable.
- Oh, my God.

651
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,113
It's just everything feels like
it's unraveling, and Bonnie,

652
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:46,742
- I don't know how she's keeping it together.
- I heard her mother is stable.

653
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,327
- Hey, Madeline.
- Oh.

654
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,454
- Hello.
- Hello.

655
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,414
Renata.

656
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,750
It's nice to see you both. You well?

657
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,959
- Yeah.
- Great.

658
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,587
- Yeah.
- You?

659
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,466
Hey, I heard you gave a great talk
the other night at Otter Bay Assembly.

660
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,176
Wish I'd seen that.

661
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,386
People pull out their iPhones
at these things.

662
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,098
I'm sure it's posted somewhere
on Instagram or something.

663
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,310
I'll look for it.

664
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:15,896
Have a good day.

665
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,777
What the fuck was that?

666
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,198
- Hi, Jane.
- Hi.

667
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,867
- What a surpri...
- Can we have a conversation, please?

668
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,285
Of course, come in.

669
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,412
- Can I get you a cup of tea?
- No, I'm fine.

670
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:36,875
I'm just a little bit curious as to what you're
doing and if you plan to take my kid next.

671
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:40,254
What? What would make you think
that I would seek custody of Ziggy?

672
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:43,131
- You're a wonderful, wonderful mother.
- So is Celeste.

673
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,215
No. No, no.

674
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,510
I have concerns about Celeste.

675
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:50,222
Her mental and emotional health...

676
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,224
I know you're her friend, Jane.

677
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,686
But truly, do you not also worry?

678
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,104
No. No, I don't.

679
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,356
Well, put yourself in my shoes.

680
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,568
If you became convinced
that the boys were at risk...

681
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,778
- They're not at risk.
- Physically at risk.

682
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,114
I've seen her as a mom.
She's a great parent.

683
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:11,994
You have seen the outward appearance,
but I've seen the drawer, with, uh, Ambien

684
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:16,623
and Vicodin and Xanax,
something with a tramma... I don't know.

685
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:20,919
All these different medications,
and she's driving on these roads.

686
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:24,339
Let me ask you,
do you ever put Ziggy in the car with her?

687
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:29,761
Does he sit in the front next to her
when the twins are strapped in the back?

688
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,848
Are you okay with that?

689
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,397
- I'm not gonna testify against you.
- But they might force you.

690
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,983
They might be able to, I don't know,
get a court order.

691
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,486
Celeste, first of all, you can trust me.

692
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,365
I trusted her,
so don't talk to me about trust right now.

693
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,492
I let her into my life.

694
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,745
I let her into my house.

695
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,121
I tried to help her.

696
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,333
Whatever you say to me
is doctor-patient privileged.

697
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,504
- You know that.
- I don't feel strong enough to handle this.

698
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:08,383
They're gonna wanna interview the kids,
and they've been through enough.

699
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,303
We've all been through enough,
for God's sake.

700
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,182
Maybe you can settle?

701
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:19,186
Don't tell me to fucking settle.
I'm not settling anything with that woman.

702
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,314
God. These are my kids.

703
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,983
And she wants them.
She wants my boys.

704
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:31,156
If she's seeking custody on the grounds
of parental unfitness or neglect...

705
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,076
Whose side are you on, for God's sake?

706
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,453
I've seen the way these things play out.
Nobody wins.

707
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,122
I will win. I'll fucking win.

708
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,375
God.

709
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:00,976
Mama.

710
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:03,229

00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,158
