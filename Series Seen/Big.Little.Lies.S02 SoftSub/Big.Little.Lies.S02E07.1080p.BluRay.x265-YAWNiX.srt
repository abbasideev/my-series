It was my fault. My fault.

21
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,245
- We have to.
- No, no, Maddie!

00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,329
You didn't push him.

00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,081
And you didn't.

00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,582

How do you kiss?

31
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,779
- Let me teach you.
- Like this?

00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:34,864
Mm-hm.

00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,367
Oh, I kind of like this.

00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,662

High intensity.
It's the new workout craze.

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,374
Are they gonna get divorced?

00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,042
No.

45
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,213
He seems mad.

46
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,174
Well, that must mean
that he loves her a lot, right?

47
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,139
But you like him.

48
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,558
Yeah, I do.

49
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,352
Do you love him, though?

50
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,520
I think you do.

51
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,563
I don't really...

52
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,151
know him well enough to love him.

53
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,196
Love is a really big word, you know?

54
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,073
But he makes you happy.

55
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,325
You're like a whole other person.

56
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,786
Your whole face and stuff
has been different.

57
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:10,251
Well, I know that the three of us
can be friends for a long time.

58
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,211
I want you to be with him.

00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,672
Ziggy...

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
And I think you wanna be with him too.

61
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,598
Last one to the bottom is a rotten egg!

62
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,453
Double Americano.

63
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,665
All right. Double Americano. Would you
like me to leave room for milk?

64
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,751
- Americanos don't have milk.
- Some like milk in their Americanos.

65
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,128
It's espresso and hot water.

66
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,297
Do I need to come back there
and make it myself?

67
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,756
No, no. It's fine.

68
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,759
- Renata?
- Thank you.

69
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,344
Oh.

70
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,221
How are we today?

71
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,389
How are we?

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,892
- We...
- Hi.

73
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,603
Are wrought, Mary Louise.

74
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:18,235
-We are worried about a wonderful mother
-Hm.

75
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,070
Who's being put through an onerous,

76
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,532
if not despicably cruel, court procedure
to, what?

77
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,660
Get to be with her own kids?
We're wrought.

78
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,496
You're a good friend to her.

79
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,417
And Celeste is very, very lucky
to have such a strong support system.

80
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,668
And I sometimes think

81
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,796
that if she hadn't tried
to take on so much alone,

82
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,508
you know,
she wouldn't have unraveled so.

83
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,009
She hasn't unraveled.

84
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,179
She's a single mom and a widow
with two kids.

85
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,472
She's done a damn good job.

86
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,350
So I encouraged a housekeeper.

87
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,185
Or a nanny.

88
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,231
She thinks nannies are too much trouble.
More trouble than they're worth sometimes.

89
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,107
- What did you just say?
- Just a mint tea.

90
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,734
- What did you just say?
- A mint tea.

91
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,029
This is exactly what you did
the last time you were at my house.

92
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,866
Stay-at-home moms who make me feel
like I should be locked up?

93
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,660
- No, you shouldn't.
- What, for neglect?

94
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,161
Because I have a fucking career?

95
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:15,084
I have spent every day of my goddamn life
putting my family and my child first.

96
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,377
So don't go there.

97
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,712
- Don't go there, judgy judger.
- I'm...

98
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,465
Keep your eyes
on your own fucking paper, Mary Louise.

99
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,010
Put it in a bag.

100
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,136
I'll take it to her.

101
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,138
Because we're going to the same...

102
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,183
With you questioning her,
she can come at you directly.

103
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,977
She can bait you, provoke you...

104
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,520
I've questioned witnesses before.

105
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,189
- With the stakes this high...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

106
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,024
- It could backfire.
- I know her.

107
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,818
And she knows that I know her.

108
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,445
So I have a better chance
of getting to her than you do.

109
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,948
- Celeste...
- It's my turn, Katie.

110
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,157
It's my turn.

111
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,539
It's a very smart play on her part.

112
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,125
Because she might be up there
in her capacity as a lawyer,

113
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,003
but she'll be presenting herself again
as a person, as a mother.

114
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,714
And this time without being subject
to cross-examination.

115
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,675
And all the questions she's asking you,

116
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,885
what she'll really be doing
is showing the judge:

117
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,682
"Look at how stable I am,
look at how reasonable, how smart."

118
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,185
I even expect her to go gently,
you know?

119
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,229
Putting her compassion on full display.

120
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,523
- If you see her doing that...
- Sleeping Beauty.

121
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,567
That's how Perry would describe her
to me.

122
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,027
Sleeping Beauty.

123
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,363
He was her prince.

124
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,700
- And she killed him.
- Mary Louise...

125
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,913
only answer the questions
that are asked.

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,169
Oh, uh, yeah.

127
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,879
No problem.

128
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,297
Okay. Let's go.

129
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,603
And she kept repeating...

130
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,441
over and over again.

131
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,109
Look what you made me do.

132
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,407
Look what you made me do!

133
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,243
All rise.

134
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:23,587
Case number CV-04111,
the matter of Joshua and Maxwell Wright.

135
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,214
This court is now in session,

136
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,883
the Honorable Judge Marylin Cipriani
presiding.

137
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,966
Be seated.

138
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,598
Mrs. Wright, please take the stand.

139
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,682
Mrs. Wright?

140
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,863
Please raise your right hand.

141
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,032
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

142
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,159
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

143
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,661
- I do.
- Be seated.

144
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,498
Okay. You're up.

145
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,215
Mary Louise.

146
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,217
Celeste.

147
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,139
Your attorney made me out
to be quite the bad mother.

148
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,850
He was just asking questions.

149
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,101
You answered them.

150
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,396
Is it your observation
that I am a bad mother?

151
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:24,814
As I...

152
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,610
As you heard me tell Judge Cipriani
when we were in chambers,

153
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:32,239
I consider you
to be a wonderfully committed parent.

154
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,492
That's not the impression...

155
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,953
As to my observations, yes.

156
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:42,082
I have observed you
being violent with the boys.

157
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:47,171
I witnessed you throwing Max to the ground
and shaking him.

158
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,716
I saw you drive off,
wearing nothing but your jammies,

159
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,969
under the influence of who-knows-what.

160
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,471
You say Ambien.

161
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,556
And you crashed the car, in fact.

162
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,517
So you're not okay.

163
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,687
That's my observation.

164
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,773
Which we can all accept,

165
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,983
after all you have been through.

166
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,697
But I cannot accept
these children being placed

167
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,033
in such imminent peril.

168
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,453
Did you ever report to Child Services

169
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,830
that you believed
my children to be in danger?

170
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:23,957
I probably should have.

171
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,375
So the answer is no.

172
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,420
Yeah, it's no.

173
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:32,424
Did you ever report to any other agency
that you believed

174
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,219
my boys to be in imminent peril?

175
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,430
No.

176
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,850
You suggested
that I got violent with my sons.

177
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,062
Is it your testimony
that I am routinely violent with them?

178
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,273
- No. Not routinely, but...
- Is it your testimony

179
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,984
that I am often violent with them?

180
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,071
No.

181
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,324
But who knows what I haven't seen?

182
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,828
So now you're basing your opinions
on what you haven't seen?

183
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,748
I'm not a trained lawyer,
so the semantics...

184
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,251
Please, would you direct your responses
to me?

185
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,752
I'm asking the questions.

186
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,548
Okay.

187
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:19,972
Now, the truth of it is, you saw me
lose my temper with my son once.

188
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:24,059
Where I overreacted,
I pushed him to the ground once.

189
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,143
All it takes is once.

190
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,188
Well, you would know that
better than anyone, wouldn't you?

191
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,898
As a young mother,

192
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,151
did you ever lose your temper
with your boys?

193
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,571
Well, this isn't simply about temper
or temperament...

194
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,074
Did you ever lose your temper
while you were driving an automobile

195
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,076
and cause the car to crash?

196
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,874
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

197
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,377
No, I heard the question.

198
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,628
It was obscene.

199
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:57,926
Your son Raymond died, in part,
because you lost your temper.

200
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,927
Isn't that true?

201
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,178
Objection.

202
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,973
This witness has testified
that I put my sons in peril.

203
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,516
It is relevant to this proceeding

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,562
as to whether or not
she has ever killed a child in her care.

205
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,606
Mrs. Wright, please sit.

206
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,732
Please.

207
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,159
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

208
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,662
I am simply trying
to protect my children.

209
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:30,792
Now, the idea of you driving with
my children in the backseat of your car

210
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,921
while you lose your temper,
that is terrifying to me.

211
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,715
Your Honor, this is indecent.

212
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:41,803
Are you suggesting this cross-examination
should be limited to decency, Mr. Farber?

213
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,139
Mrs. Wright, you don't get to go at him.

214
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:48,644
Indecent or not,
this case is about mothering,

215
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,021
which puts your parenting strategies
in issue.

216
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:57,986
Now, I cannot imagine the trauma of
losing your child in an automobile crash.

217
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,658
It must have been unspeakably devastating
for both you and for Perry.

218
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,743
It was.

219
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,579
How old was Perry at the time?

220
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,415
Oh, he was 5.

221
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,250
He was 5.

222
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,086
- Five years old.
- Mm-hm.

223
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:20,926
To witness his brother die,
his only brother.

224
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,388
Did you put him into therapy?

225
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,098
To deal with the trauma?

226
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:31,019
In those days, we were less inclined
to outsource our children's pain.

227
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,480
So you assumed that role, did you?

228
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,940
Attending to Perry's trauma?

229
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,525
Yes, I did.

230
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,069
And you talked to him?
You consoled him?

231
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,152
Yes.

232
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,071
Held him?

233
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,326
All of the above. Yes.

234
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,036
Mm-hm.

235
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,329
Blamed him?

236
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,836
Did you ever blame him
for causing the car to crash?

237
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,630
I most certainly did not.

238
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,342
Did you ever accuse him
of distracting you?

239
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,138
Did you ever say to him,
"Look what you made me do"?

240
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,221
No.

241
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,684
No? So if Perry were to have told me
that you blamed him

242
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,894
- for his brother's death...
- Objection, hearsay.

243
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:13,895
Overruled.

244
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,231
If Perry were to have told me
that you punished him,

245
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,734
that you even emotionally battered him...

246
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,069
I never, ever battered him.

247
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,780
If he told me that you said to him:

248
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,115
"This is your fault.

249
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,869
It is your fault
that your brother was killed."

250
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,579
- Stop it.
- Did you ever...?

251
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,372
- No, stop it.
- Objection, Your Honor.

252
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,583
- Did you ever, ever hit him?
- No.

253
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,209
- Did you ever kick Perry?
- I never...

254
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,253
- Mrs. Wright.
- It's a lie. It's a lie.

255
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:42,049
Mrs. Wright, we do seem to be drifting
beyond the scope of the inquiry here.

256
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:46,344
My husband physically and emotionally
abused me.

257
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,431
Your Honor well knows
that abusers don't just happen.

258
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,100
They are more than likely
to be victims of abuse themselves.

259
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,686
Whether or not this witness is an abuser

260
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,981
is certainly, certainly not
beyond the scope of this inquiry.

261
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,065
You're a liar.

262
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,738
And the fact that violence
may have been a part

263
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,909
of your sexual relationship...

264
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,911
He was not an abuser.

265
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,329
Not for one second.

266
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,289
And is Jane Chapman a liar?

267
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:23,173
Is this woman sitting here lying
when she says that your son raped her?

268
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,717
- She's mistaken.
- She is "mistaken."

269
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,220
Is that something
a woman is likely to get wrong?

270
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,472
Whether or not she's being raped?

271
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,808
Well, he perhaps got too vi...

272
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,559
Physical with her...

273
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,272
as a result of thinking
that women sometimes like that,

274
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,317
the way you enjoyed it.

275
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,154
And now you're trying
to cover over your sickness

276
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,657
with these disgusting fabrications.

277
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,912
Max and Josh need to believe
in their dad.

278
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,164
How do they get to do that
with you walking around

279
00:15:56,248 --> 00:16:00,460
calling him a rapist and an abuser?

280
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,213
The way you assassinate him,
his memory.

281
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,923
He's not here.

282
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,175
He's not here to defend himself.

283
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,552
He's the victim here.

284
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,637
- Oh, my God.
- Not you.

285
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,897
I can't, Perry. You're hurting my arm.

286
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,566
You don't wanna do this, okay?

287
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,192
I'm talking to you!

288
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,276
Get off!

289
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,695
You little shit.

290
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,196
Will you stop?

291
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,324
Fuck you!

292
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,826
Oh, my...

293
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,744
Are you gonna ask more questions?

294
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:37,997
Come on.

295
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,250
Get up, get up.

296
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,713
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

297
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,548
- Please.
- You're bleeding.

298
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,427
- No!
- Okay. Okay.

299
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,270
My sons took that video.

300
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:05,901
Your concerns that I am making up stories
about their father are unfounded.

301
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,363
Mary Louise, look at me.

302
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,492
This was your son.

303
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:21,541
You were so incredible.
I'm just sorry that...

304
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,753
I didn't know he was doing that to you.

305
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,590
That he was hurting you like that.

306
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,051
It's because I didn't tell you.

307
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,929
No, I should've known, Celeste.
I'm your best friend.

308
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,306
I should have felt something.

309
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:42,062
- You're gonna win, right?
- No, not necessarily.

310
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,648
That just spoke to Perry's evil,
but it didn't...

311
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,734
It didn't go so much
to my fitness as a mother.

312
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,447
I mean, how could I let them live
in that house?

313
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,202
How could I let them see those things?

314
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,247
And they saw so much more
than I ever knew.

315
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,627
Maybe I'm not a good mother.

316
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,671
Maybe I'm not fit.

317
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,840
Don't ever say that.

318
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,300
Don't even think that.

319
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,763
You are an incredible mother.

320
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,807
Are you perfect?

321
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,393
No. Am I perfect? No.

322
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,852
There's no such thing.

323
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,525
But you...
Celeste, look how far you've come.

324
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,735
And look at how strong you are.

325
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,320
You can't falter here.

326
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,072
Do you hear me?

327
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,865
Those boys belong with you.

328
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,868
Okay?

329
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,626
How's it going?

330
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,337
Not great.

331
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,885
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,766
I don't want you to think
that I don't like you.

333
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,562
It's not fair to put all this on you.

334
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,023
You know, you should be out there
having fun,

335
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,233
not dealing with me.

336
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,484
What is fun?

337
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,196
Is that getting drunk
and going to some bar,

338
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,741
ending up with a girl
I have no connection to?

339
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,204
This is fun.

340
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,915
Okay, first, nothing is perfect.

341
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,336
Nothing's even best.

342
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,713
But if you can find better, nice...

343
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,090
Even good is good.

344
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,677
Secondly,
no matter how good something is,

345
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,596
you can ruin it by overthinking it.

346
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,641
Just your two cents.

347
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,071
- What?
- Kill it.

348
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,489
Ten more minutes.

349
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,116
- Stop it.
- And then all the killing stops.

350
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,327
- I got it, I got it.
- Okay, there you go.

351
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,079
- Hey.
- Come on.

352
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,580
Did court go good?

353
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,290
Yeah. I think it did.

354
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,666
Were you a superhero?

355
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,255
Oh, I was like Wonder Woman
and the Incredible Hulk.

356
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,382
Combined.

357
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,716
Did you beat her up?

358
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,967
What?

359
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,427
No.

360
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,262
Nobody beat anybody up.

361
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,520
Oh, my God...

362
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,109
- Why did you lie?
- I didn't lie.

363
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,861
You said that I hit him, that I kicked him.

364
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,988
Perry told me what you did.

365
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,866
- That never happened.
- So you're saying Perry's a liar?

366
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,705
No, I... I brought him up to be good.

367
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,833
A good boy. A good man.

368
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:56,047
That person that we saw on the videotape,
I don't know who that is...

369
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,968
I hope that you don't live
to bury your children, Celeste,

370
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,346
because you would not even
be standing.

371
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,182
You lost your boys.
You don't get to take mine.

372
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,685
But... Don't...

373
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,936
Don't lie.

374
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,521
Don't lie about me.

375
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,898
Don't lie about me. It's not fair.

376
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,066
It's not fair.

377
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,495
My turn, Dad.

378
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,331
You can go.

379
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,334
You go.

380
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,173
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay by myself.

381
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,633
I've been really enjoying this time
with her, you know?

382
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,219
She's, um... She's a good listener now.

383
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,265
Okay.

384
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,487
Bye.

385
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,360
So you wanna go, huh?

386
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,494
I forgot to tell you something.

387
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,206
Or maybe I said it.
I don't remember, but...

388
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,253
it looks like now's the time.

389
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,595
I love you, Momma.

390
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,809
It took me my whole life to say that.

391
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,557
I've been thinking a lot
about something you said a while back.

392
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,435
About the lie.

393
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,688
And that it was...

394
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,067
It had a shelf life.

395
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,362
I think you're right.

396
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,283
And I've been feeling really, really bad
that I started it.

397
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,369
- You didn't start it...
- Yes, I did.

398
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:17,624
And you didn't have to follow suit,
but you did, but I started it.

399
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,707
And...

400
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,879
I can just see the damage that it's done,
and it's eroding all of us.

401
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,464
Every single one of us.

402
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,632
Including me.

403
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,843
It's unraveling all of our friendships.

404
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,346
Madeline, you and I have a friendship,
and Jane.

405
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,847
That... That's...

406
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:38,061
the Monterey Five,
whatever we call ourselves...

407
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,438
The lie is the friendship.

408
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,335
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Momma.

409
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,587
Hi, Grandma.

410
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,217
My God.

411
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,762
What's happened?

412
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,931
She woke up saying she was hungry.

413
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,977
Are you hungry, baby?

414
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,231
Will you run out and get a bottle of wine?

415
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,236
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thank you.

416
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,958
Do we really have to wear ties?

417
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,501
Yes.

418
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,294
I think it's a good idea.

419
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,965
You're so handsome.

420
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,761
Your daddy always looked so good in ties.

421
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:57,515
If he was here,
he wouldn't let Grandma do this.

422
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,683
No.

423
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,562
Now, I don't think it's likely,

424
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:07,024
but if the judge asks you any questions,
you just answer honestly and you be polite,

425
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,111
- all right?
- Tell her that we wanna stay with you?

426
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,739
Yeah. If that's what you want.

427
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,824
Yeah. You tell her that.

428
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,617
Are you scared?

429
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:17,744
A little bit.

430
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,079
Are you?

431
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,332
Mm. Kind of, yeah.

432
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,585
- Mm-hm.
- Me too.

433
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,049
We're in it together, okay?

434
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,436
Hey. What'd I say about sugar?

435
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,229
What doesn't kill you...?

436
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:48,274
No. Where did you even get that stuff?

437
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,650
I have connections.

438
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,947
Uh, you should pack up
your things, though. We have to go.

439
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,498
So is that me?

440
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,541
That punching bag?

441
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,834
It's not you.

442
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,338
I need to know what you're thinking.

443
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:15,092
I honestly don't know
if we are apart or together,

444
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,679
or getting better, or we're getting worse.

445
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:22,391
I just need to know what's in your head
before my own fucking head explodes.

446
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,313
Okay, come on.

447
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:31,942
Sit down.

448
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,617
Chloe, please.

449
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,082
You know, I've been thinking
about our wedding day.

450
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,547
Maybe because you were, like,
prancing around in your veil.

451
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,508
- Do you remember that day, Madeline?
- Yeah.

452
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,470
I remember it was really joyous.

453
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,930
Yeah, it was joyous for me too.

454
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,189
But delusional.

455
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,568
I mean, we did not know
what we were getting into.

456
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,738
I mean, you were married before,
maybe you had a better idea,

457
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:23,035
but most weddings
are just like this blind leap of faith.

458
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,204
All the vows we take, I mean,

459
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,916
we can't even know
what the fuck that means.

460
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:34,422
- L really don't like where this is going.
- Look, you are not who you were then.

461
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,260
And neither am I. People change.

462
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,269
We need to renew our vows.

463
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,230
What?

464
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,191
This time, committing to live up to them.

465
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:57,320
- Do you think you can do that?
- With all my heart.

466
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,989
Fully informed
as to what we're getting into.

467
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:04,285
Truly, truly, yes.
Committing to better or worse...

468
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,704
No, no. Your worst is off the table.

469
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,705
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay?

470
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,206
- Got it. Absolutely.
- All right.

471
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,666
Do you really mean it?

472
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,751
Look...

473
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,423
This is not some, like:

474
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,302
"Put a tidy ribbon on it,
bygones be bygones" ending.

475
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:26,432
Okay? This is a shot at a new beginning.

476
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,645
Which, like, if you really feel
that you're up to it...

477
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,147
I am. I am.

478
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:35,733
Well, then so am I.

479
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,077
- I love you.
- L love you too.

480
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,082
- This is gonna be really good.
- Yeah.

481
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,167
Oh, my God. We can do it on the beach.

482
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,211
We can have a tent, and a big party,

483
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,255
- and then we can do like a seafood...
- No, no, no. No party.

484
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:01,717
Just you, me, Abigail, Chloe.

485
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,843
Family.

486
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,013
That sounds perfect.

487
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,057
Okay.

488
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,617
It's gonna be okay.

489
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,658
- What's going on?
- There's been a setback.

490
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:10,369
- What kind of setback?
- Another stroke, most likely.

491
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:13,914
We're taking her into radiology now
to see what we're dealing with.

492
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,041
Momma...

493
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,501
Momma...

494
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:21,130
- Has she been sedated?
- No, she's just unconscious.

495
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,007
- Jesus.
- Will she wake up?

496
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,760
We have to look at the pictures
to know what's going on.

497
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,970
She's too young.
This doesn't make any sense.

498
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,722
We'll get her back as soon as we can.

499
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,017
All rise.

500
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:41,025
Case number CV-04111,
the matter of Joshua and Maxwell Wright.

501
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,735
This court is now in session,

502
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,321
the Honorable Judge Marylin Cipriani
presiding.

503
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,697
Be seated.

504
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,747
This is a difficult decision,

505
00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:01,087
one made more so by the cumulative wash
of the child psychiatrists' reports.

506
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,797
These reports, which conclude...

507
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,049
If I may be heard, Your Honor.

508
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,132
All right.

509
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,556
What I saw on that video...

510
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,772
I simply had no idea.

511
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,775
I'm so sorry. I...

512
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,738
I don't know what to say
to make you forgive me.

513
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,283
I had no idea.

514
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,871
If I had...

515
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,123
But...

516
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,213
this is not about forgiveness or blame.

517
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,509
This, today, is about the well-being
of these two splendid young men,

518
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,555
Josh and Max.

519
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,685
Your Honor, I told you from the outset,
I bear no contempt for my daughter-in-law.

520
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,395
In fact, I... I love her.

521
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,064
How could I not?

522
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:05,943
She made my son so happy.
And the boys.

523
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,115
But, Celeste, you are ill.

524
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:17,913
What we saw on that video
was repugnant.

525
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,957
It was grotesque.

526
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,750
I'm so ashamed of my son.

527
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:27,047
But you were a part of it.

528
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,507
You were complicit in it.

529
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:32,928
You have admitted to me,
to yourself, to this court,

530
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:37,474
that you were a part of this sickness
that you exposed your children to,

531
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,643
that they may have been infected by,

532
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:43,898
that they recorded on their smartphone
to stick in their memory book.

533
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:47,443
It's a sickness that,
given your most recent...

534
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,405
social adventures with strangers,

535
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:56,076
it seems that you are unable to resist.

536
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,786
So...

537
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,458
Your Honor, I have no doubt
that she will get herself well.

538
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:08,797
But in the meantime, right now,
we just need to safeguard the boys.

539
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,137
She wants what's best
for her grandchildren,

540
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:19,433
as she did for her son, Perry.

541
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,269
That man that you saw on that tape,

542
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,816
that was because of your parenting,
your caregiving.

543
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,945
It's one thing to be asked
to turn your children over.

544
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:34,573
It's quite another
to be asked to give them to you.

545
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,453
These are my babies.

546
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,913
I am their mother.

547
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,208
And I have protected them
against the most formidable of odds.

548
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,710
I kept them alive. I kept myself alive.

549
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,049
And on this, I agree with you,
Mary Louise, you had no...

550
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,134
No idea.

551
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,596
And that is the problem.

552
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,600
My sons are...

553
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,310
They're good boys.

554
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,149
And I will raise them to be good men.

555
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,609
They will be good men.

556
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,785
I have a list of conditions
and compliances,

557
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,413
which will be entered
together with my judgment.

558
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,541
They are self-evident
and they are to be followed.

559
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:30,170
As for the judgment itself,
as it's been noted by all,

560
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:33,924
these boys have been through
an unimaginable ordeal.

561
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:38,804
They face great challenges ahead
with their healing, their development.

562
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:39,972
It won't be easy.

563
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,060
I'm not going to make it any harder
by taking them away from their mother.

564
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,855
The petition to appoint guardianship
is denied.

565
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,149
Full custody shall reside
with Celeste Wright.

566
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,942
- We're adjourned.
- Oh, my God.

567
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,823
I'm sorry.

568
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,184
I need you to do something for me.

569
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,208
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

570
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,195
- Here.
- Thanks.

571
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,535
I'm so sorry, honey.

572
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,333
Nathan.

573
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,797
You're a good man

574
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,217
and a wonderful father.

575
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,719
Skye adores you, and she should.

576
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,099
And I know you love me.

577
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:52,813
But you've been right to think
that something's been going on with me.

578
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,399
So I'm gonna be truthful.

579
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,653
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you this sooner.

580
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,621
I'm not in love with you.

581
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,375
I know this isn't the best
time to tell you, but I...

582
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:15,961
I don't think I've ever been.

583
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,218
I just can't lie anymore.

584
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,222
I'm sorry.

585
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,887
What the fuck is this?

586
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,138
Well, hi.

587
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,600
Why is this still here?

588
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,687
Funny you should ask.

589
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:19,483
I sold it all today to Ted Farrell.

590
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,819
The guy gave me a check for 410
for the whole kit and caboodle.

591
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:26,990
- Nice. Well, Celeste...
- And the best part is, we get to keep it all.

592
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,203
What do you mean,
we get to keep it all?

593
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,122
Ted's just a collector,
only cares whether it appreciates or not.

594
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,834
And he knows there's no better steward
for it than me, so we get to keep it all.

595
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:41,505
So basically, you're saying
you get to keep your toys?

596
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,966
Ah. Perfect, huh?

597
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,051
No.

598
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,931
No, it's not perfect.

599
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,892
- It's far from fucking perfect.
- Oh, God.

600
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:57,604
- All my stuff is gone.
- Look. Come on. Please.

601
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:00,774
We got money for this, all right?
Calm the fuck down.

602
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,402
- Calm down?
- Yes, calm down, all right?

603
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,155
You lost all our money.

604
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,077
- Oh, my God, here we go.
- You have plunged us into bankruptcy.

605
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,205
- Yeah.
- We are selling our home.

606
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,374
Our daughter's home.

607
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:21,420
And all the while,
you've been fucking the nanny?

608
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,673
Well, now she's gone,
I need something to play with, don't 1?

609
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,428
Oh, my God.

610
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,227
That was too much. I'm so... Hey!

611
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,063
What the fuck are you doing?
We don't own any of this!

612
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,189
Goddamn it!

613
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:44,109
- Renata! Fucking hell!
- Fuck youl!

614
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,028
- Come on now... No.
- Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck!

615
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,237
Fuck it!

616
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:50,532
- Not that. No, come on, don't...
- Is that your favorite fucking baby?

617
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:51,867
No! Hey, hey.

618
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,536
No!

619
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,420
Oh, my God.

620
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,800
Maybe you should've shown a woman
a little respect!

621
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:14,722
I'm done.

622
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,685
No more bullshit.

623
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,147
No more lies.

624
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:45,379
Do you, Ed,
take Madeline to be your wife?

625
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:49,049
To love her, comfort her,
honor and protect her,

626
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,301
as long as you both shall live?

627
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,385
I do.

628
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,474
Do you, Mom, take Ed
to be your husband,

629
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:01,561
to love and comfort him,
honor and protect him,

630
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,147
as long as you both shall live?

631
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,231
I do.

632
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,528
Okay, I therefore proclaim
that you are husband and wife.

633
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,279
