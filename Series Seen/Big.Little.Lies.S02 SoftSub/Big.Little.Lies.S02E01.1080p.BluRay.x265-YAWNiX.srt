First day of school!

49
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,083

- Hey, hey, boys come on.

I can't hear myself think.

Then just don't think, Mom.

00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,673

Fine young men

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,391
don't suddenly become fine young men
all of a sudden

57
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,893
in a whoosh, you know.

58
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,438
It starts with being fine young boys.

59
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:17,776
And part of being a fine young boy
is listening and respecting your mother.

60
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,820
She works so hard for you.

61
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,198
That's why the sun shines on her so.

62
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,910
Thank you, Mary Louise.

63
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,709
I have two showings,
I have Abigail's college advisor,

64
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,294
not to mention all this scrutiny.

65
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,213
- It's just gonna be a day.
- What scrutiny?

66
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,799
Ed, this is the first day of school.
We have to earn our good mom badges

67
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,636
all over again.
"Has she gotten fatter over the summer?"

68
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,430
"Does she look older?"
These questions get asked, Ed,

69
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,724
and we all get judged all over again.

70
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,227
It's a double standard.
If a dad shows up, they're like:

71
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,479
"Wow, there's a dad here. He's involved."

72
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,440
But with the moms, ugh.
It just makes me wanna blow.

73
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,524
Boom!

74
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,569
Oh, my God, Chloe. Goddamn it.

75
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:04,657
Just right there. I need to get right
there. Could you please turn it down?

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,242

Let's all say that together, shall we?

89
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,631
Wonderful, wonderful Otter Bay.

90
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:07,136
Here we go. Now, gang, since we ask
our children to sing this every year,

91
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,805
I think it's time we sing it with them,

92
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,934

and sing along.

Warren.

101
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,466
Really pushing the school spirit
this year, aren't you?

102
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,426
Well, it's my otter blood, Madeline.

103
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,012
- Hi, Madeline Martha Mackenzie.
- Lisa Coolidge.

104
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,306
Anyway, it was a beautiful service, Warren.

105
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,559
Well, thank you, Madeline,
I like to think of it more as an assembly.

106
00:07:55,643 --> 00:08:00,064
A service is for when someone dies,
you know, like a school fundraiser.

107
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,358
You're not seriously gonna go there,
are you?

108
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,151
My hope is you don't go there.

109
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:09,114
Now, let's remember a lot of last year's
mishigas were lovingly stirred up by you.

110
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,866
Anybody want a red velvet?

111
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,077
- Melissa.
- Cupcake?

112
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,746
- I'll take one for each thigh.
- Absolutely.

113
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,332
I don't even like to chew.
I just shove them down.

114
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,085
Maybe you can give one to Warren
so he can shove it too.

115
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,419
Ah.

116
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,338
And we're off.

117
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,383
- It's a classy crop of moms, these ones.
- Bonnie.

118
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,342
Those gluten-free?

119
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,760
Tahoe was good?

120
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,680
Uh, yeah, it was good.
Nathan caught a lot of fish.

121
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,843
- Wow.
- And I hear you're selling houses like crazy.

122
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,766
That's very cool.

123
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,352
Oh, my gosh, in Monterey,
it is like printing money.

124
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,937
I should've done this years ago.

125
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,065
- I'm gonna go find Skye.
- Okay.

126
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,736
Okay. Are you two fighting?

127
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,864
No. Actually, I almost wish we were.
No, she's...

128
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,576
She's been acting like that
for a while now.

129
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,703
Acting like what?

130
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,248
Shut down. Like, withdrawn.

131
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh, you mean you're not having sex.

132
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,919
Don't forget
Abigail has her college counselor meeting

133
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,587
- at 2 p.m.
- Yeah, I got your e-mails.

134
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,880
Six of them this morning.

135
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,216
- It's good. Thank you.
- This is her future, Nathan.

136
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,135
Nice to be back.

137
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm told that my daughter, Amabella,
is gonna be in your class. So exciting.

138
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,724
Yes, very nice to meet you.

139
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:22,396
Um, she has an 1Q of 152. Genius level,
right? That's a very high number.

140
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,482
Life's about give and take.
I expect you to take care of my daughter.

141
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,692
Pay special attention.

142
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,026
And, again, welcome.

143
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,530
Um, oh, oh, oh.

144
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,950
And my Amabella was bullied last year.

145
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,120
I mean, in, like, biting and choking.

146
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,707
So we're gonna make sure
that doesn't happen again.

147
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,001
Oh.

148
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,253
Sorry.

149
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,588
Sorry.

150
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,840
Here's my problem
with the whole meditation thing.

151
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,718
Like you shut out the world,
but you also shut out your friends,

152
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,801
which is a bit weird.

153
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,680
And also, does she look funny?
Something's not right.

154
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,724
- You're talking about Bonnie?
- Mm-hm.

155
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,687
Like, she's off.
But she was off before she went to Tahoe.

156
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,149
Unplugged is one thing,
but unhinged is a total other thing.

157
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,026
Hey! Asshole! Hey!

158
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,403
- Oh, hon.
- Why are you cutting me off?

159
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,573
- Honey. The horn. The horn.
- Dick! I just think we... Oh, yeah, sorry.

160
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,950
- Once I lean in, you know how I am.
- Indeed.

161
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,912
And I think we need to talk to her
and see where her head is at.

162
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,747
- Do you?
- Do you wanna get a coffee?

163
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,877
By the way, did you see Renata
getting up that new teacher's ass?

164
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,254
I thought she was gonna have to pull out
her snorkel.

165
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,298
Easy.
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.

166
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,674
Can you get me an Americano?

167
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,801
Will do.

168
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,136
- Hey, Bruna.
- Hey, Madeline.

169
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,013
Do you sell weed?
Smells like weed over here.

170
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,307
- Keep the change.
- Thank you so much.

171
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,477
Can I get an Americano
and a bran muffin?

172
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,854
- That's a thing?
- Mary Louise?

173
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,982
- Hi. I'm Madeline.
- Hi.

174
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,611
- Madeline. So nice to see you again.
- Yes. I'm Celeste's friend. Yes.

175
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,656
- How have you been?
- Good, good. The kids are good.

176
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,658
- How are you?
- I can't complain.

177
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,160
Actually, I can.

178
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,665
My son is dead.

179
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,587
But Celeste tells me
that you continue to be so helpful

180
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,381
with her and the boys and...

181
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,591
She should just get
a proper housekeeper.

182
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,010
- You're very short.
- Excuse me?

183
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,680
- I don't mean it in a negative way.
- Oh.

184
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:21,890
Maybe I do.

185
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:26,687
I find little people to be untrustworthy.

186
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,440
My apologies. It's just that I'm...

187
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,736
I pride myself on being
a very good judge of character,

188
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,240
but you have always presented
such a difficult read.

189
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:43,328
You know, you seem like a nice person.
Loving.

190
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,582
But, also, you strike me as a "wanter."

191
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,001
- A wanter?
- Mm.

192
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,087
You know, there are people in life

193
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,756
who content themselves
with what they have,

194
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,134
and then there are others who just...

195
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,553
Just want.

196
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,347
I'm not a wanter.

197
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,685
Oh, you don't have to take it personally.
Anyway, I'm a wanter myself.

198
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,064
You know what I want?
I want Perry back.

199
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:16,069
I wanna know what happened that night.
And I'm very tempted to ask you,

200
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:20,365
but I doubt I would get the, uh, truth,
would 1?

201
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,162
Your son lost his balance and he fell.

202
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,332
Yes, that seems to be the company line.

203
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,626
Depending on whose company you keep.

204
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,419
Mary Louise.

205
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,714
Madeline and I were just... talking.

206
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,593
What the hell was that?
That was a very strong position.

207
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,220
And I didn't like it.

208
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,639
Welcome to my life.

209
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,813
Sorry.

210
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,815
Whoa.

211
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,568
- Hi.
- Tori.

212
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,071
Sorry, I didn't recognize you at first.

213
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,782
Yeah. I, uh, had my breasts done.

214
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,744
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's fabulous.

215
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,955
I always felt a little self-conscious,
you know.

216
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:10,999
About your breasts?

217
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,793
- My nose.
- Ah.

218
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,712
Now nobody notices it so much.

219
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,758
Everybody notices these, though.
And that pisses Joseph off.

220
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,511
So, uh...

221
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,554
Well, I'll see you around.

222
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,016
Hmm.

223
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,855
How long does she plan to stay?

224
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,150
Well, she comes and goes.
It's a short hop from San Francisco.

225
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:42,114
She's been a really big help.

226
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,073
Mm-hm.

227
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,534
I mean, I'd be lost without her.

228
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,286
So, what brings you?

229
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,663
It's been a while.

230
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:00,090
I've had some nightmares
starting up of late that, um...

231
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,094
I mean, may be triggered
by the beginning of the school year.

232
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,597
I think I still associate
that place with...

233
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,807
How could you not?

234
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,523
Last night was...

235
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,400
It was a beauty.

236
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:27,117
Perry and I
were in the in-vitro facility, and...

237
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,205
it was all so sweet, and...

238
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,207
And suddenly, I...

239
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:39,212
I turned into a monster.

240
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,799
I was strangling him.
I was lifting him up, and I...

241
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,306
It was beyond disturbing, and I...

242
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,852
A little exhilarating.

243
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,729
Hmm.

244
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,317
Is that...?
Do you see yourself as a monster?

245
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,362
I guess I still feel...

246
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,867
responsible.

247
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,950
For?

248
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,538
For the accident.

249
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,583
I mean, if I'd left him when I should have.

250
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,668
We should never have been together
that night,

251
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,545
and he might still be alive.

252
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:25,175
That I chose that night, of all nights,
to leave him and to tell him and...

253
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,349
Even in death, his message lives on.

254
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,976
- What message?
- That you're to blame.

255
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,354
That you're always to blame.

256
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,442
You're not.

257
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,118
Are you getting out?

258
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,163
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

259
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,791
That part of me is still dead, I suppose.

260
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,252
First things first,
get the boys' lives back on track.

261
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,419
That's the priority.

262
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,547
Seeing their mom happy
could help there.

263
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,799
So you're saying
for my life to go on successfully,

264
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,843
- I need to be with a man?
- No.

265
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,262
But the freedom to be with one, maybe.

266
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,851
You're still married, Celeste,
and the husband is dead.

267
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,875
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

268
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,750
Where have you been?

269
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,254
I told you I was running.

270
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,965
That was like two hours ago,
I've been calling you.

271
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,048
Sorry.

272
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,183
Bonnie. I just thought it might be
that you hated Tahoe,

273
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,018
but since we've been back...

274
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,354
Come on.

275
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,441
I need some space, Nathan. I told you.

276
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,234
Just let it be.

277
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,572
He's my favorite in the whole
aquarium. It's a red octopus, and watch.

278
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,325
The closer he gets to the kelp,
he'll change his color

279
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,493
so that he camouflages
with his environment.

280
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,746
- Cool.
- Look. You see him right now?

281
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,873
- Yeah.
- He's changing color.

282
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,917
You guys wanna know a fun fact
about octopus?

283
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,627
- Yeah!
- It's kind of weird.

284
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,837
- You can handle it?
- Yeah.

285
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,757
Okay. Females contain deadly venom.

286
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,384
And sometimes they'll kill
and they'll eat the males

287
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,261
after they mate with them.

288
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,554
Ew!

289
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,388
- I know.
- Interesting.

290
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,101
Why is it the prettier something is,
the more dangerous?

291
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,020
Like with snakes and spiders.

292
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,689
That's a great question.
I wish I knew the answer to that.

293
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,483
- One second.
- You're so observant.

294
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,319
Sometimes, pretty colors
are to give a fair warning

295
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,656
so other animals know
they need to keep a safe distance.

296
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,115
Oh...

297
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,163
There you go.

298
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:07,878
How you doing?

299
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,548
Good. You?

300
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,719
Not really, no. Bonnie.

301
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,472
I mean, she's gone missing
in mental action.

302
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,058
The whole summer, truth be told.

303
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,434
Hey, man, could I...?

304
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,690
Could I ask you a big favor?
Could you maybe take her out to lunch?

305
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,652
You've always been better
at talking to women than I have,

306
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,321
and you certainly got Madeline
in a way that I never could.

307
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,824
I mean, I think you might be able
to get her to open up.

308
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:39,536
You know, you have your little way.
All I'm getting is pushback at every turn.

309
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,206
I swear to God, if I signed up for
this bullshit, I'd still be with Maddie.

310
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,833
I mean... I don't mean...

311
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,085
Oh, no, no. Um...

312
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:51,089
Look, Nathan,
I'm no expert on marriage or anything.

313
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,465
I mean, something tells me

314
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,510
if you're seeking out the husband
of your ex-wife

315
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,306
to, like, lead the communication charge
with your new one...

316
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,312
- Why do you always have to be so snide?
- I don't mean to be.

317
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,440
You don't mean to be, it just comes
natural. Like you're a snide fuck.

318
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,317
That's what you are. A snide fuck.

319
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,903
You know, Nathan,
maybe instead of just talking to Bonnie,

320
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,573
you should embrace
some of her interests.

321
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,656
- Her interests?
- Yeah.

322
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,784
She won't even let me embrace her.

323
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,244
- Okay.
- Yeah, you're snide.

324
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,537
- You're a snide fuck.
- What?

325
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,873
- Whatever.
- Come on.

326
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,207
Snide fuck.

Hey, honey. I'm pulling in.
Can you...? Can...?

Wait. Hold on one second. Hold on...

- Hello?
- This is my talk about being nice.

I love the view.

Oh, sorry, I'm on the phone.

337
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,822
Yeah, I thought Tahoe was supposed
to be about decompression too,

338
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,491
but she seems like she's on Mars.

339
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,575
Maybe she's using.

340
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,370
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, just a second.

- Hmm?

00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,711
Oh, let me call you back.

344
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,215
Yeah, what can I do for you?

00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,133
I can't deny it.

346
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:21,054
- ♪ It's my house and I live here ♪
- Good, right there.

347
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,266
♪ It's my house and I live here ♪

348
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,435
Beautiful. Come on down. Good.

349
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,855
- Eyes up this way. Gorgeous.
- I'm so tired of those shots of women.

350
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,357
I mean, they're in power, right?

351
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,360
They own banks,
and they're all, like, demure. Bullshit.

352
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,488
Back to the ocean.

353
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,948
What's all this?

354
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,909
Hey. The photo shoot. Women in power.

355
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:49,666
- I thought they wanted just, uh, office shots.
- No, they're doing house and office.

356
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,749
You look nice.

357
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,671
- ♪ It's my house and I live here ♪
- Here we go. Look at me.

358
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,605
So she has a 3.8 GPA,

359
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,109
and she has done charity work
with human trafficking.

360
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,194
- She also has an internship coming up...
- Okay.

361
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,988
Stanford has an admit rate of under 10.

362
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,450
Princeton and Williams the same. Since
she doesn't have legacy going for her...

363
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,994
Any of these schools would be lucky
to have her.

364
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,329
She's an excellent candidate...

365
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,623
- Candidate is, I think, the wrong...
- Honey.

366
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,376
What? Don't "honey" me.
She has a 3.8 GPA.

367
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,796
She has a 1350 on her SATS,
but we're gonna get that number up

368
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,549
because she has private tutoring
coming up, so I feel...

369
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,676
I don't even wanna go to college.

370
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,806
Okay. She's just... She's just nervous.
She doesn't mean that.

371
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,059
I do mean it. I don't wanna go to college.

372
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,897
It feels so good to say that out loud.

373
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,774
Okay, Abigail, honey.
You're going to college.

374
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:01,654
The planet is dying, Mom,
but God forbid I don't study Lysistrata?

375
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,990
It's bullshit.
Do you know what kids do at college?

376
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,410
They drink, they fuck.
They mull over a sex change.

377
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,456
- I'm not going. I'm not going to college.
- You're going to college.

378
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,708
If you wanna go, you go.
You should go to college.

379
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,127
Hey, no,
I know how to make any situation about me.

380
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,963
This is not that.
This is about you and your future, Abigail.

381
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,047
Abby.

382
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,594
- I'm not going.
- I'm so sorry.

383
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,015
-Where did she go?
I...

384
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,520
- Did you know about this?
- No, I swear.

385
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,314
You were with her all summer,
and you knew nothing about this?

386
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,899
- I didn't know.
- What about Bonnie?

387
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,901
Did she know
about this "fuck college" plan?

388
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,528
Bonnie's left the building.

389
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,700
Unbelievable. You know if she doesn't
go to college, she won't have a life.

390
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,287
She'll just be serving Big Macs
and French fries, and that'll be her life.

391
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,249
- Is that what you want for her, Nathan?
- Stop. Stop yelling at me.

392
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,334
- You know you bear some responsibility.
- I do?

393
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,795
-You're her father. This is
her senior year, -Oh, okay.

394
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,257
She's on the cusp of her life,
and you let it go all to shit in Tahoe!

395
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,176
- You just hit me. You just hit me.
- Because you deserve it.

396
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,363
But honestly, Ed,
if she doesn't go to college,

397
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,906
what's she gonna do?

398
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,283
Go into retail?

399
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,619
Let me call you right back.

400
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,998
- Mary Louise?
- Hey, Maddie.

401
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,165
Madeline. Hello.

402
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,667
What's going on?

403
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,462
Well, I thought I might look
for a small flat here in town,

404
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:45,675
so that I can help out with the boys
but not quite be so underfoot.

405
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,636
- Oh, I see.
- Do you work here?

406
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,471
- Yes.
- Do you handle rentals?

407
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,308
- I do, actually. Oren and I both do, yes.
- Oh.

408
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,101
I see you're wearing heels.

409
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,146
Yes.

410
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,150
Um, Oren, do you mind if I just
have a minute with Mrs. Wright?

411
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:05,028
Of course not.
You're in wonderful hands.

412
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,111
Thank you.

413
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,199
Mary Louise,
I realize that you're still grieving,

414
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,328
and that you've been through
a tremendous amount of heartbreak,

415
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,663
but I don't care
for the way you spoke to me before.

416
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,707
It was rude, and I didn't deserve it.

417
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,709
No, you didn't.

418
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,753
Um, I apologize.

419
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:23,880
Well, thank you.

420
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,007
The truth is it had nothing to do
with you.

421
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,177
When I was in boarding school,
I had a best friend,

422
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,012
or so I thought,

423
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,765
who, uh, revealed herself
to be quite treacherous

424
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,726
and, uh, caused me a lot of pain.

425
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:38,936
So...

426
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,358
She was just an itty-bitty little thing
with a big, bubbly personality

427
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:48,738
that, um, was designed to hide
that she was utterly vapid inside.

428
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,825
You remind me so much of her
that I suppose I punish you for that.

429
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,119
That's wrong of me, and I apologize.

430
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,291
- Oren.
- Yes. Sorry.

431
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,253
I'm sure Oren will address
all of your concerns.

432
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,922
Okay.

433
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,216
Where did we leave it?

434
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:25,191
♪ Oh, to see without my eyes ♪

435
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:30,697
♪ The first time that you kissed me ♪

436
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,866

442
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,017
Oh.

443
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,357
- That probably looked weird.
- Yeah.

444
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,487
Are you on the spectrum?

445
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,449
Are you?

446
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,617
Uh... I'm...

447
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,870
Yeah, most likely.

448
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,416
- Well, I don't think I am, but...
- A little advice.

449
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,835
You probably don't wanna
act weird and shit in public.

450
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,837
We do a lot of kids' events
at the aquarium.

451
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,631
Parents have a thing
about entrusting their kids to psychos.

452
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,552
Noted. Got it. Thank you.

453
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,180
The way people talk in this town,
I don't need to tell you.

454
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,100
You don't need to tell me?
What does that mean?

455
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,437
You're one of the Monterey Five, right?

456
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,856
Monterey Five?

457
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,733
You were there the night the guy fell.

458
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,111
- Where did you hear that?
- Someone at work.

459
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,405
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

460
00:26:56,616 --> 00:27:00,286
- It was just the way he said it.
- How exactly was that?

461
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,830
Like we all have scarlet letters
on our backs.

462
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,624
- Oh, please.
- We're kidding ourselves

463
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,877
- if we think people have stopped talking.
- Yeah, but people talk. It's...

464
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,379
I think we're all being a
little bit paranoid, you guys.

465
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,132
I think people have moved on.
The police definitely moved on.

466
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:16,052
- We don't know for sure.
- Yeah... No, I talked to Susie Burke.

467
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,720
- Do you know Susie from IBM?
- Yeah.

468
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,431
She's a good friend of Detective Quinlan.

469
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:21,515
- Oh.
- Mm.

470
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,643
I mean, like, really good friend.

471
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:28,105
Gossip for another day, but she told me
that she heard Quinlan say,

472
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:32,860
like, the case isn't "closed" closed,
but they've got nothing.

473
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,654
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

474
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,239
Good.

475
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,784
- We're good.
- Okay.

476
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,867
Yeah.

477
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,467
Where were you?
We were waiting for you at the beach.

478
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,928
Oh, yeah. Um, something came up.

479
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:00,971
Yeah?

480
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,058
What?

481
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,937
Are you all right?

482
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,982
Do you care?

483
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,817
Do I care?

484
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,901
What's going on?

485
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,575
I killed someone.

486
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,285
- Remember?
- Yes.

487
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,870
- I...
- It's heavy.

488
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,290
Are you...? I mean, are you angry at me
for some reason?

489
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,045
I'm angry with myself.

490
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,049
If I had just told the truth,
I would have gotten off,

491
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,217
but you said he slipped,

492
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,344
and everyone else joined
in the fucking chorus.

493
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,222
- That was to protect you.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

494
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,060
You know, I can't talk to my husband.

495
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:50,688
Or my kid.

496
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,942
I have to just swallow it all.

497
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,029
You can talk to us.

498
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,489
We're here for you. All of us.

499
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,869
Well, it hasn't really felt like that.

500
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,997
Well, I'm sorry, but you've been in Tahoe.

501
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,709
It's not like you can put that shit on
Gmail. Like, what am I supposed to...?

502
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,210
Hey.

503
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:14,712
Hey.

504
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,795
Bye, Maddie.

505
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:25,139
- Little Miss Sunshine, right?
- Listen, I'm sorry I pushed you.

506
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,349
There you go, I said it.

507
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,269
Okay, um, I need to talk to Abby.
Is she here?

508
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,438

00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,498
So...

513
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,250
what was that all about?

514
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:57,588
I just don't think college is for everyone,
that's all.

515
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:58,798
Okay.

516
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,301
So why is it not for you?

517
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:05,763
Well, starting with the cost.

518
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,848
It's really expensive.

519
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:11,143
So I'm assuming that if you're gonna
abandon that plan to go to college,

520
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,561
- you have another plan...
- I do.

521
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,273
What is it?

522
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,277
- It's to work for a startup.
- Oh, my God.

523
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:24,532
Specifically, one that builds
for-profit housing for the homeless.

524
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:25,658
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

525
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:31,622
And unlike, you know, the privatized shams
like banks and credit card companies,

526
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:34,792
ours will make money
while actually helping people.

527
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,293
This is something real?

528
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:39,338
I've been offered a position
to start in June.

529
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,507
- You cannot be serious.
- I'm gonna take it.

530
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,344
You cannot mortgage your future
over some sort of short-term plan.

531
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:48,639
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, then, what are you doing?

532
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,600
There are four million homeless people
in America,

533
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,769
the average age being 9 years old.

534
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,396
- And I...
- I don't give a fuck!

535
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,399
I don't care
about fucking homeless people.

536
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,736
- What?
- That is not what I meant.

537
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,529
I do care about homeless people.

538
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,490
I just think you can give money
to some charity

539
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,659
while you actually attend college.

540
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,203
- I'm not going to college.
- Yes, you are.

541
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,999
- Give me one good reason why I should.
- It's non-negotiable. You're going to college

542
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,752
because I said so,
and because you're not thinking straight...

543
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,837
- Because you said so?
- Yes, because I said so.

544
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,922
What do you know?
You didn't go to college.

545
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,842
That's exactly why you're going.

546
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,469
Exactly.

547
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,554
Because you will have no life!

548
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,529
Can't you just tell her it's time to go?

549
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,908
The boys love her. I mean, they love her.

550
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,826
And she's...

551
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,079
She's a big help. She really is.

552
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,582
So, what's up?

553
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,877
I'm guessing you don't need my help
on how to handle a mother-in-law.

554
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,923
Why are you not cashing the checks?

555
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,510
- I don't know.
- Come on, Jane. Why?

556
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,888
It's rape money. You know I can't do that.

557
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,726
Ziggy's entitled to it.

558
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,728
He's part of Perry's estate.

559
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,649
Do you ever hate me? Just a little bit?

560
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,278
How could I hate you?

561
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,572
Because I slept with your husband.

562
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,200
I mean, I didn't...

563
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,743
You know what I mean.

564
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,411
He raped you.

565
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,663
But I knew he was married.

566
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:39,458
I mean, I didn't know he was
married to you, but somebody.

567
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:40,417
No.

568
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,628
I don't blame you for anything.

569
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,882
I think I would if I were in your shoes.

570
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:51,637
Celeste, for a man to commit adultery,
he... There has to be another woman,

571
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,141
and, you know what, more times than not,
she's complicit. I was complicit.

572
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,520
Not in the end,
but definitely in the beginning.

573
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,989
Are you glad that he's dead?

574
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,910

Thank you, Mary Louise.

I thought we were having KFC.

586
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:01,642
Well, one cannot survive
on fast food every night.

587
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,644
We don't have it every night.

588
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:08,148
You know that they ban
these insidious fast food institutions

589
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,567
from some parts of San Francisco.

590
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:14,488
Do you remember when we walked
across the Golden Gate Bridge?

591
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,698
It's red.

592
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,700
Yeah, you're right, it is red.

593
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,911
Oh, and Dad said
he was gonna swim to Alcatraz.

594
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,705
Oh, yeah.

595
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,165
Sharks would have eaten him, stupid.

596
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,917
No, they wouldn't, idiot.

597
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,546
Hey! Hey! You could hurt him.

598
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,007
What's wrong with you?

599
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,844
- I barely touched him.
- You stuck him with a fork, Josh.

600
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,470
That is unacceptable.

601
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,639
For God's sake.

602
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,186
I miss Dad.

603
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,316
I know, baby.

604
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,525
I know you do.

605
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,819
We all do.

606
00:35:55,946 --> 00:36:00,784
- We still have some recovery ahead of us.
- Well, they're grieving, Celeste.

607
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,538
Their father's death is not...

608
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,667
something to be recovered from,
like a cold.

609
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:12,046
You know,
your daddy was the most amazing man,

610
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,048
and you were so lucky to have him.

611
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:19,678
And it's very unfair
and wrong that he died.

612
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:23,140
And you still feel angry about it,
don't you?

613
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:27,561
I mean, you feel angry that the other kids
have their dads. You don't.

614
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:31,565
You know, the other day,
I was with some friends,

615
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:36,153
and, um, their sons were not a patch
on your dad.

616
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,780
Not a patch.

617
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,283
Just... I felt so angry.

618
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,493
Angry!

619
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:48,499
You know, that their mediocre,
spindly, pudgy, balding,

620
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:51,585
middle-management sons, still alive.

621
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,629
And my Perry...

622
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,714
My Perry...

623
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,258
I just felt just... I wanted to scream.

624
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,261
So you know what I did?

625
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,013
- What?
- I did scream.

626
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,558
You wanna hear?

627
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:07,643
Okay.

628
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,030
Mary Louise! Mary Louise!
Mary Louise, please.

629
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,574
What, my grief is too loud for you?

630
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,326
- Oh, Celeste.
- No, just... Just...

631
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,328
- I should be more discreet.
- The boys.

632
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:29,331
We should scream. We should scream

633
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,459
and beat our breasts and tear our hair.

634
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,919
Don't you feel angry?

635
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,465
You don't?

636
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,182

We... It was like every instinct
inside of me told me that she was...

646
