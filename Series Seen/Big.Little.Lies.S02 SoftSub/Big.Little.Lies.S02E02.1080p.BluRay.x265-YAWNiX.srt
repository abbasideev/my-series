And then I don't...

22
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:38,867
You don't remember?

23
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,080
I was driving and...

24
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,124
Ma'am, have you had anything to drink?

25
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,250
No, I haven't.

26
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,591
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I took a pill at 2 a.m.

27
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,968
- You don't remember getting in the car?
- No.

28
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,721
But you passed the Breathalyzer?

29
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,556
I did.

30
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,353
Babe, you gotta be careful with Ambien.

31
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,521
Hey.

32
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:12,651
Hey, Bonnie.

33
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,445
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

34
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,448
In the middle of nowhere?

35
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,991
This isn't the middle of nowhere.

36
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,868
You're on the side of the highway.

37
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,328
I was hiking.

38
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,121
Okay...

39
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,247
What are you doing?

40
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,541
Do you need a ride?

41
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:33,381
Why would I want a ride if I'm on a hike,
Madeline?

42
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,716
- Are you on drugs?
- Am I on drugs? What are you...?

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,843
- Are you on drugs?
- I'm sorry...

44
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,180
- I'm just walking. Can I walk?
- That just came out... I'm sorry.

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,641
My God.

46
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,601
Do you see what I'm saying?

47
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,853
I have to get Abigail out of her house.

48
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,188
That woman's not well.

49
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,485
- Thank you. Here.
- No, it was eight women.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,532
- Uh-oh. What?
- You are a fucking incredible publicist.

51
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,784
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- What?

52
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,246
Guess who's going to be on the cover
next month

53
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,457
of the number one women's magazine
in the U.S. of fucking A?

54
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,751
- I have no idea.
- Oh, I think you know.

55
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,212
I think you know
because you're fucking married to her.

56
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,713
Oh, baby.

57
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,341
-My cover girl. I've always known
-Gordon Klein.

58
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,344
- You were a cover girl.
- Special Agent Michael Nelson with the FBI.

59
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,096
- Hands on the hood of the car.
- Sorry...

60
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,265
- What's going on?
- Hands on the hood now, sir.

61
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,975
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What the fuck?

62
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,103
- Title 18 of U.S. Code, section 371.
- Hold on! There's confusion, sir.

63
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,772
- That's security fraud...
- That's my husband, Gordon Klein.

64
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,107
Ma'am, please.

65
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,270
- Securities fraud, title 15 of U.S...
- Call Walker.

66
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,611
What the fuck is going on here?
What are you doing?

67
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,155
You can't just assault somebody.

68
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,323
You have the right
to remain silent.

69
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,326
You have the right to have an attorney
present during any questioning.

70
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,203
Call Walker now!

71
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,288
- Let's go.
- You can't...

72
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,373
We need you to stop, ma'am.
You need to relax.

73
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,167
You're taking my husband in handcuffs.

74
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,586
We understand.
We will get you the information.

75
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,885
You had me worried sick.

76
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,972
You know, it's my fault.
I had a bit of an emergency this morning,

77
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,474
and Celeste came to my rescue.

78
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,558
Where's your car?

79
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,021
It broke down.

80
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,189
Are the boys okay?

81
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,942
Uh, yes, they're getting ready for school.
You went out like that?

82
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,737
- Well, I had to.
- It was an emergency.

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,280
What kind of an emergency?

84
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,824
The kind short people have?

85
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,704
You don't like me, do you, Madeline?

86
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,583
I'm sure you mean well.

87
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:38,130
You know, when I was very young,
my family just moved, and we...

88
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,091
I was going to a brand-new school,
so I was especially scared,

89
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,177
and my father gave me the best advice.

90
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,264
He said,
"Mary Louise, you just seek out the bully,

91
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,641
make friends with her."

92
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,437
Am I the bully in this scenario?

93
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:58,067
On your awesome days,
I suspect you are a godsend.

94
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,238
But on your bad days, decidedly less so.

95
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,660
Fucking weirdo.

96
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,743
What?

97
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,039
What?

98
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,293
So did you think
about our practice date?

99
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,462
- Our practice date?
- It's like a trial run.

100
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,341
We could shower, we'd put on clothes,
we go to a restaurant,

101
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,053
we eat, talk, and if it's not a total
disaster, then we could do it for real.

102
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,890
Yeah.

103
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,141
Um...

104
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,395
I don't want to offend you, but you are...

105
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,524
I do think you're a very genuine person,
but you're a very...

106
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,317
You're very strange.

107
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,489
You know, one of the last
socially acceptable bigotries

108
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,575
is the one against weirdos.

109
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,910
For what it's worth,
I'm emotionally intuitive.

110
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,037
I get a feeling about people sometimes.

111
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,748
- Mm. You have one about me?
- To be honest, no.

112
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:59,378
But you're really tolerant
and you're friendly,

113
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,671
and you're really pretty.

114
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,464
You look good in waders.

115
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,593
How could I least not make room
for the possibility?

116
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,816
Are you and Dad going to get divorced?

117
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,320
What? Honey.

118
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,614
No, of course not.

119
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,782
What makes you say this?

120
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,911
Dad never makes you laugh.
And you seem mad at him.

121
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,539
Well, I am not mad at him. Okay?

122
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,711
Who are you mad at?

123
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,254
Nobody.

124
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,931
Hey.

125
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,187

I still miss him.
I don't think it's ever gonna stop.

133
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:39,186
When you talked to me about dating again,
it felt like an affront.

134
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,855
Like, preposterous, even.

135
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,776
I only want him.

136
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,571
I'd like to try something.

137
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,121
Think back to one of the times
he was abusing you.

138
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,084
The time in the closet
after his office Christmas party.

139
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,674
I want you to close your eyes
to replay that incident.

140
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,470
- Please, don't ask me...
- It's important. Can you try?

141
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,018
I want you to close your eyes.

142
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,897
To replay the incident.

143
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,044
Mm.

144
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:59,183
Now I want you to put a close friend
in your place.

145
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,022
Let's make it Madeline.
Put Madeline there instead of you.

146
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,983
- Excuse me, I can't...
- Let's make it Madeline.

147
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,708
Stop it.

148
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,004
No!

149
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,467
No!

150
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,885
No!

Should Madeline stay
in that relationship?

154
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,091
Just...

155
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,264
Jacket.

156
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,099
Thank you.

157
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,270
Not today.

158
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,353
All right.

159
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,817
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Step over here please, ma'am.

160
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,154
Arms like an airplane.

161
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,784
Oh, my God.

162
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,041
Gordon. What the fuck?

163
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,544
What the fuck?

164
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,384
I'll be out on bond, so...

165
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,802
Oh...

166
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,639
- Talk to me.
- I, uh...

167
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:09,146
I made a big bet to short some stock
with, um, Saul Hoffman's company.

168
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,065
Phederol, I think I told you about them,
it's the anticoagulant.

169
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,735
The anticoagulant.
I thought that was a bust.

170
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,195
It was. Oh, my...

171
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,156
Um, which I knew, but, uh...

172
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,242
no one else did.

173
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,410
- Uh...
- Oh.

174
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,997
- Fuck.
- So then the test results completely tanked,

175
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,665
so I started shorting bigtime.

176
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,169
Do you have to do time for that?

177
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,965
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay...

178
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,426
Listen.

179
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,261
That's not the worst of it.

180
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,387
What?

181
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,642
I kind of bet the ranch.

182
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,313
Our ranch. There's gonna be civil lawsuits
to follow that.

183
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,440
- No.
- Um...

184
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,442
We stand to be broke
by the end of the year,

185
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,445
- and it might even be sooner.
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I don't...

186
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,905
Listen, listen, listen.

187
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,033
Amabella's gonna be okay.
They can't touch her trust.

188
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,410
- It's irrevocable.
- But I didn't sign anything.

189
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:09,164
-No, no, I know. I know you didn't,
-I didn't do anything. So my money is safe.

190
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,875
But it's community property.
Amabella's trust is...

191
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,003
Fuck. Goddamn it.

192
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,254
Gordon...

193
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,717
I'm not gonna not be rich.

194
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,388
- I'm not gonna have you...
- This could be like a positive thing.

195
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,557
That... Like, there are chapters of life...

196
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:32,104
I will not not be rich.

197
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:42,239
♪ Oh, I'm asking ♪

198
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,951
He's really smart.

199
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,121
I don't think there's
much faking it to him.

200
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,791
He's very...
Think "what you see is what you get."

201
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,750
He's weird, though.

202
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,004
He's like maybe "Aspergery" or something.

203
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,880
Like, there's just something...

204
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,259
I don't know.
I've never really met anyone like him.

205
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,594
They fake that sometimes, you know.

206
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,638
- What? Having Asperger's?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,433
- Get away with saying dumb shit.
- Bonnie.

208
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,268
- Mom.
- Hey, baby.

209
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,901
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Surprise.

210
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,701
- Your husband called me.
- What?

211
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,162
You had no right.

212
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,497
It's not about being right.
It's about being scared.

213
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,249
- Scared of what?
- Of losing you.

214
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,711
Nathan, if you're scared of losing me,
why don't you try talking to me?

215
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,423
I fucking tried, and you know it.
I've tried. You know that.

216
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:46,136
You know what, it fucked me up some
when my marriage to Madeline ended.

217
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,222
Divorce creates trauma.

218
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,641
Think something is gonna go on forever
and it doesn't.

219
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:56,021
Then you're on the other side of it... You
don't trust the ground underneath your feet.

220
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,941
I've never lost sight of the fact
that marriage is fragile.

221
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,443
That it can all go away.

222
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,404
And you...

223
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,907
I don't know where you've gone,
but you're not here.

224
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,800
He's in prison,
and he might stay in fucking prison,

225
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,219
and he's lost all our money.

226
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,137
- Maybe he gets out, what, for days?
- What?

227
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,639
- Until they fucking... Yes.
- What?

228
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,141
He's lost fucking everything.
My money too. His money.

229
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,393
- Okay. Here, here. Come here, come here.
- What?

230
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,687
No, we can't go in there.
We're not going in there.

231
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,273
Babe, this is a disaster.

232
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,067
Oh, my God.

233
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,070
Oh, my God.
This fucker put me back in the hole.

234
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,364
This fucker put me back in the hole.

235
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,742
This is my fucking childhood.

236
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,912
This is everything I've worked
to get out of.

237
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,956
-Quinlan was there. I am telling you,
-What?

238
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,625
I think she's been watching,
and she tipped somebody off.

239
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,338
- What? I thought it was the FBI.
- But then who the fuck is tipping them off?

240
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,591
And why is the FBI
taking my fucking computer?

241
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,760
They went to my office.
They took my iPad.

242
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,929
- What?
- I just... Okay.

243
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,639
I need to call an estate lawyer.

244
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,350
Okay, and I need to do a list of assets.

245
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,727
- You're right.
- Do you need a Xanax or...?

246
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,732
When we swallow our feelings,
especially the bad ones,

247
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,443
sometimes they can turn
into really ugly monsters,

248
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,154
which is not a good thing.

249
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,991
I want you to know that it's perfectly okay
to come and talk to me, okay?

250
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,161
You can talk to me about anything,
whether it was over a put-down,

251
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,122
something that happened here,
something that happened on the news,

252
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,875
anything you need to talk about,
I'm here.

253
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,006
Anyone?

254
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,305
What about a dead father?

255
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:01,313
He said it quite simply,
without any sense of trauma, so...

256
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,440
Whether that's better or worse...

257
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,572
- Are they still getting counseling?
- Um, yeah.

258
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,657
I'm really sorry about this.

259
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,828
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

260
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,706
It's good to talk about what we feel.

261
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,789
I just...

262
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,339
I just think it's best if you talk to me,
you know, rather than at school.

263
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,134
- But you don't like to talk about it.
- That's not true.

264
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,553
You like to pretend everything's okay.

265
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,893
Well, I shouldn't do that.

266
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,855
We're a family, and...

267
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:49,819
And a family is meant to be open
and honest with each other, so...

268
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,323
I don't think we're that kind of family.

269
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,785
What? Yeah, we are.
Of course we are, Max.

270
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,537
Of course we are.

271
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,341
- Grandma.
- Put it on the counter, please.

272
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,762
Hi.

273
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,389
What happen...?

274
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,975
Something came up at school.

275
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,352
It's like you said the other night...

276
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,730
They're still grieving.

277
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,609
It's all just so hard, you know?

278
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,944
Hmm...

279
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,949
I do. I do know.

280
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,952
Right after the accident,
after we lost Raymond,

281
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,539
I was sure I would not be able to go on.

282
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,876
I was never sure
about anything in my whole life,

283
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,879
that I wouldn't go on, but I did.

284
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,172
Because of Perry.

285
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,051
And so will you, because of the boys.

286
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,765
What happened this morning?

287
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,354
I don't know. I just...

288
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,695
I took an Ambien when I couldn't sleep,
and before I knew it, I was driving a car.

289
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,448
- Has that ever happened before?
- No.

290
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,915
I've decided to rent an apartment locally,

291
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:31,713
so that I can, um, be nearby,
but not, you know...

292
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:36,176
I wanna be here when you need me, Celeste,
and not when you don't.

293
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,846
I'm so grateful to you
for everything you've done,

294
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,973
but a little space might be good.

295
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,232
Madeline told me
that you and she had words.

296
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,400
I don't like her.

297
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,986
Well, you have to try.

298
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,865
Well, I have tried, but she's not
a likable person.

299
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,329
She's been a lifeline to me.
She really has.

300
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,997
- She's a wonderful person.
- Mm.

301
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,333
Well, you're mistaken.

302
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,753
Did I ever tell you
that she once saved Max from drowning?

303
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,129
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

304
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,673
Huh.

305
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:16,757
Where were you?

306
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,179
- What?
- I feel like you always look at me

307
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,265
with such... suspicion.

308
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,684
No, I don't mean to.

309
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,523
I do look at you as, uh... an enigma.

310
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,192
That's how Perry first described you
to me.

311
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,902
Did you know that?

312
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,278
Stop it! Hey!

313
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,280
- Stop, you idiot!
- Hey!

314
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,490
Stop!

315
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,034
- Hey!
- Stop!

316
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,786
- That's enough.
- Stop it.

317
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,038
- Stop it. I said stop it.
- Stop it! Stop!

318
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,665
That is enough! Stop it!

319
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,000
That is enough.

320
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,836
- Fuck off!
- What did you say?

321
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,963
No!

322
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,090
You will not be like him!

323
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,173
You...

324
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,511
Max, I'm sorry.

325
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,097
Maxie? Maxie, I'm sorry.

326
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,890
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,852
Mom.

328
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,854
Oh, my God.

329
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,188
Josh, come here.

330
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,942
Are you all right? Huh?

331
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,776
Are you okay?

332
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,538
You smell that?

333
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,458
Clears your sinuses right out.

334
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,212
We have all this newfangled stuff
to improve ourselves.

335
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,300
Self-help apps all over our phones.

336
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:47,515
Sometimes all we need to do
is just stand still and breathe.

337
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,519
To just breathe in the air
that's all around us.

338
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,229
Is that for me, Mama?

339
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,816
You want me to breathe better?

340
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:06,242
- Tell me what's going on, Bonnie.
- Nothing, Nathan's just tripping.

341
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,120
Nathan is a complete dolt.

342
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,081
When it comes to emotional,
social intelligence,

343
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,126
oh, Bonnie, he's as dumb as a rock.

344
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,590
But I often wonder
if that's why you married him.

345
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,135
You are out here surrounded by people
who don't even get you.

346
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,137
They don't look like you.

347
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,724
I haven't seen one other black person
since l've been out here.

348
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,935
Is that why you're here?

349
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:36,940
I mean, because we all know
how fond you are of your walls.

350
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,483
You are out of control.

351
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,113
Something's in the air, Bonnie.
And I don't like it.

352
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,705
You know, I decided to run.

353
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,500
For office?

354
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,504
I swear to fucking God, man.
No, I decided to take up running

355
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,340
because Bonnie likes running.
She's obsessed with it.

356
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,677
- I'm trying to embrace her interests.
- So I'm off the hook for lunch, then?

357
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,347
You remember what you said to me
last year about "give me a reason"?

358
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,849
Should we just get this
out of our system, man?

359
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,979
Okay, so you've asked me
to have lunch with your wife,

360
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,774
and now you challenge me to a fistfight.

361
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:23,611
I mean, do you have a preference
if I can't squeeze in both?

362
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,614
Really?

363
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,159
- So that's a no, huh?
- Okay.

364
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,370
- Don't, buddy. Don't.
- Okay.

365
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,453
Warning.

366
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:42,255
Case 6273.
United States v. Gordon Klein.

367
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,466
James Taylor on behalf
of the United States, Your Honor.

368
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,890
Steve Gardner on behalf
of Mr. Klein, Your Honor. Plead not guilty.

369
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,980
Mr. Klein.

370
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,734
You're being charged with security fraud,
mail fraud and wire fraud,

371
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:07,572
violating Section 17A
of the Securities Act of 1933

372
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:11,618
and Rule 105
of Regulation M of the Exchange Act.

373
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,454
Question of bail?

374
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,830
No priors, judge.

375
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:20,918
I ask that the defendant post bail
in excess of $1 million

376
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,421
in light of the severity of the charge.

377
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,757
One million sounds excessive.

378
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,634
One million bond.

379
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,011
Five hundred thousand dollars cash...

380
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,346
Stop!

381
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,850
We'll conference on Tuesday
to set a schedule.

382
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,478
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

383
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,447
I swear someone's gonna do a start-up,

384
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,158
and they're gonna make,
like, the perfect French fry.

385
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:56,120
It's gonna be, like, nutritional
and healthy and no cal.

386
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,372
It's gonna be a gold mine.

387
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,375
Remember when you used to call them
pomp freaks?

388
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,542
Mm-hm.

389
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,127
French fries.

390
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,130
When she was little,
I told her they were called pommes frites,

391
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,550
and then she started calling them
pomp freaks.

392
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,428
I never even noticed you
eating a French fry.

393
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:13,680
I eat French fries.

394
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,973
Yeah, you're right.
You just didn't notice, did you?

395
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,600
That's your thing, isn't it?

396
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,895
- Wait, what?
- Don't get all sensitive with yourself.

397
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,814
I'm not. I'm not being sensitive.

398
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,482
- I'm just... What do you mean?
- Honey?

399
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,653
No, I notice things.

400
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,738
I mean...

401
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,450
Like, I noticed shit,
and then I asked you to come.

402
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,035
- So...
- Well, I'm here...

403
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,914
because you're ill-equipped
to connect with your wife.

404
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,504
- Mom, you're drinking again.
- No.

405
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,925
I mean, it's just one glass. Occasionally.

406
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,510
One glass is fine.

407
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,054
One hundred, not so much.

408
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,389
Those days are over.

409
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,184
- Your problem is you're oblivious.
- Will you stop?

410
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,396
You call me and you say
that something's wrong with Bonnie.

411
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,940
"Bonnie's not herself."

412
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,695
"Been going on six months
to a year or so."

413
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,742
Can you narrow that down
a little bit further for me, Nathan?

414
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,911
I mean, can you pinpoint a specific date?

415
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,830
Instance. Anything?

416
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,166
Because I can.

417
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,836
It was after that event.

418
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,715
You all went to that student gala.

419
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:31,966
Where the man died.

420
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,677
And Bonnie was there.

421
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,806
Your wife watched a man
fall down the steps

422
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,226
and bust his goddamn head open
and splatter all over the place and die.

423
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,896
I don't know, from then to now,

424
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,482
she's probably been dealing
with post-traumatic stress.

425
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,150
I'm fine.

426
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,486
- We're in a restaurant, honey.
- What does that mean?

427
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,363
What, we should just glaze over it?
Act like everything is okay?

428
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,074
Things are not okay.
Your daughter is not okay.

429
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,913
And this mope-a-dope shit,
it clearly is not working for your husband.

430
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,415
And I doubt very much
that it's working for your child.

431
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,210
And from what I see,
it is not working for you.

432
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,293
Mom.

433
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,592
I'm really happy you're here.

434
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,349
Can we just have a dinner
like a normal family?

435
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,435
We are having dinner
like a normal family.

436
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,980
Getting in each other's business, that's
what families do. That's why he called.

437
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,497
So you don't have any siblings?

438
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,748
I had a brother.

439
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,208
Oh.

440
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,669
He passed away when I was 5.

441
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,170
Oh...

442
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,547
Sorry about that.

443
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,591
What about you?

444
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm an only child.

445
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,517
- L mean, as far as I know.
- Oh, yeah?

446
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,104
Yeah, I'm not very close to my dad, so...
Right?

447
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,565
You never know.

448
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,487
So your mom passed away,

449
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,991
and you don't have any siblings,
as far as you know,

450
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,618
and you don't talk much to your dad.

451
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:23,703
Mm.

452
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,126
Now, I don't mean to be presumptuous,
but...

453
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,796
if this works out...

454
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,758
I would have you all to myself.

455
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,023
- Boys are tucked in.
- Thank you, Mary Louise.

456
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,817
They must have been exhausted.
Max is asleep already.

457
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,279
They tell me they have a brother.

458
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,866
Evidently, Perry had a son.

459
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,243
- What?
- With another woman.

460
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,120
And the boy's in their class.

461
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,916
Seems I have another grandchild.

462
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:14,503
Might you have the decency to tell me...

463
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,630
his name?

464
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,135
- No.
- Then how could they know?

465
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,638
I don't know.
You know what, we did tell that detective.

466
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,681
- That bitch. She probably let it slip...
- Mom.

467
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:29,894
I'm sorry. You know what, Celeste,
just find out what the boys know exactly

468
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,063
and then call me right back, okay? Bye.

469
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,857
What now?

470
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,068
Celeste, just stuff with the twins, and...

471
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,445
Did they find out Ziggy's their brother?

472
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,655
Who told you that?

473
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,616
I heard you talking on the phone once.

474
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,951
Did you tell Max and Josh?

475
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,496
Only that they have a brother
in the second grade.

476
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,873
- Chloe, good God.
- I didn't say who.

477
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,750
- Did you tell Ziggy this?
- Mm-hm.

478
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,337
Wait, Perry Wright is Ziggy's father?

479
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,757
- You know what, go to your room.
- I'm sorry.

480
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,885
Give me your phone.
I'll deal with you later.

481
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,472
I'm so sorry. She's grounded.

482
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,061
- I gotta go.
- Okay, I...

483
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,689
Oh, fuck.

484
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:18,192
Hey. Talk for a sec?

485
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,821
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything. Um...

486
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,783
Did Chloe Mackenzie say anything
to you about...

487
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,494
About who your father is?

488
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,999
She said it was Max and Josh's dad.

489
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,333
Is it?

490
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,261
Mm-hm.

491
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,890
How long have you known for?

492
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,517
Since August.

493
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,146
Ziggy, you've known since August
and you haven't said anything to me?

494
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,149
Figured you'd just lie.

495
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,653
I didn't know.

496
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,864
All of those years
of you asking me where he was

497
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,449
or who he was, I...

498
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,535
I didn't know who he was.

499
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,667
I didn't know until Trivia Night.

500
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,294
- And...
- But why didn't you tell me?

501
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,337
Because I didn't know how.

502
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,923
I just thought that I would wait.

503
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,928
- Till when?
- Till you got older, I guess.

504
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,684
Did Chloe tell you anything else?

505
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:39,273
She said something about Mr. Wright
giving you salt.

506
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,525
That's how I happened.

507
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,027
He salted you.

508
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,205
No.

509
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:05,966
Then what did she mean?

510
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,969
Can I sit down next to you?

511
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:23,150
I think what Chloe overheard
was the word "assault."

512
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,031
What does that mean?

513
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:46,966
- Look, I wanted to tell you.
- Yeah, but you didn't.

514
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,718
Well, I was trying to protect
Jane and Celeste's privacy.

515
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,555
- But I'm your husband. Okay?
- Okay, but can you understand

516
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,392
and maybe contemplate for a minute
the fundamental violation

517
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,727
of a woman's privacy
when you're talking about rape?

518
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,273
How about the fundamental violation
of our family, of our marriage.

519
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,152
I mean, I'm your husband.
I am supposed to help you with this stuff.

520
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:11,407
I mean, of course she's gonna hear you
whispering on the fucking phone, Madeline.

521
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,118
I mean, look what our daughter did.

522
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,997
What are we, people who keep secrets
from each other? Is that our thing now?

523
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,123
Come on.

524
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,625
Jesus.

525
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,755
Mom?

526
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,010
I'm really sorry again.

527
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,056
I know you are, honey. I know.

528
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,020
You can't tell your friends private things
that you've overheard us say on the phone.

529
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,774
Okay?
No more eavesdropping, young lady.

530
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,735
Is Daddy mad at me?

531
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,447
Daddy's mad.

532
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,741
But that's the thing about families,

533
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,619
is that you can be mad and you can fight,

534
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,538
but you get over it,
and you always come back together.

535
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,707
That's what families do.

536
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,834
- So we're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

537
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,755
Can I have my phone back?

538
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,595
So this thing
was supposed to have happened when?

539
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,431
Like nine years ago?

540
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:21,894
When you two were trying so hard
to have a baby? Please.

541
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,941
When did you find out
about this alleged affair?

542
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,486
It wasn't an affair. It was a rape. Rape.

543
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:34,657
- When did you find out?
- The night he died.

544
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,412
Then how can you...?

545
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:44,291
This woman, she could have had
multiple partners, you know.

546
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,753
She could have been drugged.
She... You don't know her.

547
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,463
She could have been...

548
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,590
What if she got it wrong?

549
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:52,925
Aren't you desperate

550
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,678
- She didn't.
- For her to be wrong?

551
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,723
Aren't you desperate to know
that he wasn't unfaithful?

552
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:04,311
To believe that he... He wasn't capable
of doing the things that she said.

553
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,356
He wasn't.

554
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,566
I'll never believe that.

555
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,486
Your son wasn't an innocent man.
He beat me up.

556
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,905
- I don't believe you.
- Many times. He...

557
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,199
Why wouldn't you go to the police?

558
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,911
- I probably should have.
- But you didn't.

559
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:24,164
- No, because it wasn't simple.
- I don't believe you.

560
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,750
I don't understand why you're so willing
to believe her.

561
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:32,881
I don't know why you are willing
to assassinate his character, his memory,

562
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,550
who he was.

563
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,511
- What...? I...
- It's so hard.

564
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,972
I'm telling you what it was.

565
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,267
I'm not saying I was blameless.

566
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,479
I'm just telling you
we were violent with each other,

567
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,231
and sometimes...

568
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,403
Sometimes it would lead to sex.

569
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,032
I don't... I...

570
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,700
We loved each other.

571
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,036
- We were...
- But he beat you up.

572
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,373
We had a sickness.

573
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,459
And you didn't go to the police?

574
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,044
I just...

575
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,964
I'll go to the police.

576
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,550
What?

577
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,469
To get some answers.

578
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,596
You left some things out, didn't you?

579
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,266
The fact that he fathered another child.
You left that out.

580
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,269
That you planned to move,
that you rented an apartment.

581
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,562
You left that out.

582
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:34,526
That you were planning to leave him
the very night he died.

583
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,028
You left that out.

584
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,407
And that you...

585
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:45,871
You learned of his infidelity
just 10 seconds before he...

586
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,336
went falling down a flight of stairs
to his death.

587
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,340
Oh, you left that out too.

588
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,422
How's Ziggy?

589
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,007
He's, uh...

590
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,801
I don't know.

591
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:25,845
And you?

592
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,308
Um, I gotta tell you something. I...

593
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,979
I told Ziggy about the circumstances.

594
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,690
The violence of it?

595
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,150
Mm-hm.

596
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,902
- What?
- Just a little bit, but he knows

597
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,822
that he cannot share it with Max and Josh.
That it's just for him.

598
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,241
- But we had an agreement.
- I know. I know.

599
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,161
- We were gonna wait.
- I know, but I can't lie to him anymore.

600
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,245
- I can't...
- No, I...

601
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,206
-His entire life has just been built
-Jane.

602
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:55,667
On a foundation of lies.
I can't just... I can't continue.

603
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,794
And I know
that you have to protect your boys,

604
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,297
but I have to protect mine.

605
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,424
I have to be honest with him.

606
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,514
Ugh. God, this is so fucked up.

607
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,894
Have you told your boys about Ziggy?

608
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,314
Not yet, no. I just...

609
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,485
I will. I mean...

610
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,493
Bonnie.

611
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,994
- Hey.
- Hey.

612
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,372
- Could you talk for a second?
- Sure.

613
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:34,915
Um...

614
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:40,254
This is in no way meant to blame you
or Nathan at all, for that matter,

615
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:44,049
but that said, I just feel strongly
that Abigail come stay with me.

616
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,593
Yeah,
she needs more than I can give her.

617

What's going on?

618
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,558
Are you okay?

619
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:59,106
No, I'm not okay. I told you I wasn't okay.
I'm having a hard time with the whole thing.

620
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:05,904
Sometimes I wake up at night in a sweat
with this feeling.

00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:19,792

Are you fucking kidding me?

00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,639
Did I ever explain to you
that I wanted more?

639
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,058
- Is that what I said to you?
- Maybe I wanted more!

640

- Just get the fuck out. Please.
- Oh, please.

641
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:21,146
- Just stop being dramatic and drive.
- You're gonna blame me?

642
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,650
- Did I say I was blaming you?
- Blame me while you lost my money?

643

- I didn't say...
- Get out of my car!

- This is my car.

I'm not resisting the idea
of coming back here.

650
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,953
Well, that's a relief.

651
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:22,290
As long as the main goal isn't
trying to convince me to go to college.

652
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:26,086
The endgame is to move you
into a stable environment

where your executive
decision-making skills are nurtured.

654

That's a good one.

655
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,718
Can I just say one thing, though?

656
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,511
I think you're being rash, honey.

657
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:38,515
Life is a series of building blocks
that you stand on and you grow on,

658
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,810
and I feel like you are kicking
the most fundamental building block,

659
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,146
which is education,
right out from under you.

660
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,899
You used to claim that family
was your most fundamental building block.

661
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,985
Well, of course. It's very important.

662

family isn't always everything, but...

688
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,322
sometimes it is.

689
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,661
- Was Daddy a bad person?
- No.

690
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:23,744
No, no, no.

691
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,750
Your daddy was a wonderful person.
A beautiful person.

692
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,586
He could be weak...

693
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:36,800
like we all can.

694
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,927
And he could make mistakes, but your...

695
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:47,185
Your daddy was a beautiful,
wonderful man.

696
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Okay. Uh...

697
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,791
Thank you for coming back.

698
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,459
[, um...

699
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:18,133
At best as I fathom,
and I cannot fathom what I've done, I...

700
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,596
This was about me, and I...

701
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:26,057
I'm so sorry. I... This was not about you.

702
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,184
- Maybe about us as a couple.
- Mm-hm.

703
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,478
And I think we should get therapy.

704
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:31,688
Okay.

705
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,482
But I need you to know
that this has nothing to do with you.

706
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,068
This happened so long ago.

707
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,279
And it has nothing to do
with how much I love you

708
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,364
because I love you so much, and...

709
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:46,119
And I just need to know
what you're thinking.

710
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:53,001
That you would keep the secret
that you kept about Perry and Ziggy.

711
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,340
That you would be unfaithful.

712
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,466
Um...

713
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,179
That you would tell Abigail about it.

714
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:08,808
I know. That is...
That happened in a moment of weakness.

715
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:09,892
When?

716
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,395
Last year.

717
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,148
So she's known a year?

718
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:19,694
My daughter,
and yes, I do think of her as a daughter,

719
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,197
has known this for a year?

720
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,325
Yes, I'm sorry, I fucked up. I, um...

721
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,745
But I'm gonna do anything I can to fix it.

722
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,665
- Does Chloe know?
- No.

723
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,625
No, of course not.

724
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,379
- How can you be so sure?
- No, Ed, I promise you, she doesn't know.

725
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,339
I'm so sorry, she...

726
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:45,845
Look, this just isn't about you.
It's about me. This is about us.

727
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,306
When you say "us," what...

728
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,809
I mean, what does that even mean?

729
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:55,355
Because it can't mean honesty.

730
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:59,901
Right? It can't mean truth or trust.

731
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,446
I mean, it can't mean you and me
confiding in each other,

732
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,533
so what's "us"?

733
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:13,039
You asked me what I'm thinking.
I'll tell you.

734
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:15,792
I think we're done.

735
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,861
I do appreciate you coming, Mama.

736
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,903
I do.

737
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:47,406
Meaning...

738
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,616
"Enough."

739
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,253
I do not want any of that
in my family's life.

740
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,257
We're not having that conversation again.

741
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,015
I have been having visions lately, Bonnie.

742
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,685
- And I know you've had some too.
- Mom.

743
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:21,191
- They are strong, baby.
- Don't. Don't.

744
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,653
- Somebody's drowning.
- Stop.

745
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:30,742
I see lots of water,
and somebody's drowning.

746
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,498
I see you drowning right now in a way.

747
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,337
Who's gonna protect you, baby?

748
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:46,800
I do not need you to protect me.

749
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,304
Not from evil spirits, or your visions...

750
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,430
From what, then?

751
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,558
Tell me.

752
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,525
What have you done this time?

753
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,276
Hmm?

754
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,326
I do want you to go.

755
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,582
I love you too, honey.

756
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,005
Okay, you invited her, you get rid of her.

757
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,340
Get rid of her?

758
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,884
Like, maybe with rat poison?

759
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,470
Or a weekend with Maddie?

760
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,519
Seriously, though,
can you tell her to go?

761
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,651
Can you tell me what's going on?

762
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:51,364
Be patient, baby.

763
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,034
