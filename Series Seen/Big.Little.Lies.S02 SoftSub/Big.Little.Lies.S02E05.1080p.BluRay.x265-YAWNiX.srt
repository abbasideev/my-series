I pushed him.

21
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,951
Listen to me! Listen to me! I pushed him.

22
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,746
Nobody did this.

23
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,873
Nobody.

24
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,293
Help! Somebody help me!

25
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,837
Fuck.

26
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,126
Hey, Ed. Ed.

27
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,961
Hold on, man. Hey.

28
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,840
Hey. Listen, man.

29
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,887
I'm sorry for the whole party thing.

30
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,305
Yeah, I overreacted.

31
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,725
You know what? I don't believe you.

32
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,477
- What?
- That you're sorry.

33
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:10,733
- Why do you have to be such a fuck?
- Well, I don't have to be. I choose to be.

34
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,152
See, not everybody gets along, Nathan.

35
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:17,114
I mean, can't we just be comfortable
not liking each other?

36
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,449
Doesn't have to be a reason.

37
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:26,165
This whole fucking world's lost its mind.

38
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,878
This whole fucking planet
is inhabited by nutfucks!

39
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,129
Hey, nutfuck!

40
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,808
Basically, this is child custody.
We will set a hearing.

41
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,519
I will appoint a psychiatric investigator.

42
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:51,065
He or she will interview the parties, the
children, your associates, your friends,

43
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,567
anybody and everybody
he or she deems necessary

44
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,195
to making a recommendation
to the court.

45
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,614
In the end, it will come down
to my judgment

46
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,618
whether there's been behavior
detrimental to the children.

47
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,579
- Any questions so far?
- May I be heard, Your Honor?

48
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,789
Very well.

49
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,960
I do not consider Celeste Wright
to be a bad person.

50
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,087
- Good to know.
- A wonderful mother.

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,923
- Mary Louise.
- And I don't have any reason to doubt

52
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,551
- her ongoing commitment to them.
- Okay.

53
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:22,638
- So, what are we doing here?
- That said, she's not well.

54
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,265
- All right.
- It's true.

55
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,393
- This isn't the time, Mrs. Wright.
- Well, that you understand.

56
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,813
This is not a case of angry mother-in-law
on the loose or something.

57
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,524
- So unfair.
- Rather, it's as you suggest,

58
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,610
we have to do
what is best for the children.

59
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,780
We will take this up
at another time. This is inappropriate.

60
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,157
- Yeah, we're good.
- Thank you.

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,910
Thank you very much. Thank you.
We will see you at the hearing.

62
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,621
- How do we not respond to that?
- Because we don't.

63
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,707
- You're a lawyer.
- But we should have.

64
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,461
She gets to make a sympathetic first
impression, and what, I just sit there silent?

65
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,673
Which, in the face of an accusation, can be
deemed an admission of fucking guilt.

66
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,884
The judge won't see it that way.

67
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,761
She's after my kids.

68
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,558
That's exactly the type of flare-up
they'll be looking to provoke. Okay?

69
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,642
God.

70
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,938
She gets to make an opening statement,
and you did nothing.

71
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,274
I didn't hire you to do nothing.

72
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,567
Please.

73
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,405
Because nothing
was exactly the right response, Celeste.

74
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,699
We have a very smart judge in there.

75
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,785
One who will be able to see through
your mother-in-law's performance

76
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:30,122
and see it for what it was.
Just a performance.

77
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:34,668
I told you, I am not about putting up that
kind of performance. I'm about credibility.

78
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,839
So when I speak, judges listen.

79
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,593
- And now I need you to listen.
- Okay.

80
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:47,014
They don't win here
unless they establish you as unhinged.

81
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,476
So you should expect everything
and anything they do say

82
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,854
to be precisely designed
to get you to react.

83
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,982
We will not give them that.

84
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,884
Mom.

85
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,141
Hi.

86
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,893
- What a nice surprise.
- Hi.

87
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,565
- Where's Dad?
- Outside with Grandpa.

88
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,279
Is she getting better?

89
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,822
A little.

90
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,532
Still can't talk, though.

91
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,953
- Today's gym, right?
- Mm-hm.

92
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,038
- Got all your stuff?
- Yep.

93
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,874
Oh, I miss you.

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,420
There's a surprise for you at home.

95
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,255
- Shh. Hey. What?
- Oh, yeah?

96
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,718
- Okay.
- All right. Time to go, big girl.

97
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,430
- Pit stop's over.
- Okay.

98
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,979
Bye, Grandma.

99
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:22,568
Love you, baby. Thanks for stopping by.

100
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,446
Bye. I love you. Bye, Grandpa.

101
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,529
Bye.

102
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,509
The most important thing
is that you remain open-minded.

103
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,720
You know, really, open to new theories...

104
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,181
This isn't gonna be like
wife-swapping, is it?

105
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,601
No. This is a healing institute.

106
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,562
Not a swingers' convention.

107
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,731
Please have an open mind. Please?

108
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,232
I'm in the car.

109
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,027

116
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,639
I couldn't believe it.
I sat there and I didn't say anything.

117
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,059
Katie seems to think that's the right thing
to do, I'm not thinking straight.

118
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,644
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm just not.

119
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,690
This is disgusting. I mean, honestly,
I wanna sit down with Mary Louise.

120
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,317
Well, I don't think that that would help.

121
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,069
I don't know, Celeste.

122
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:53,117
Listen, don't get me wrong,
but, um, you're an attorney yourself,

123
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,537
and we gotta just say it:
lawyers fuck things up often.

124
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,165
And that's why
I wanted to ask you about Katie.

125
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,085
- Well, what about her?
- Well, I mean, is she...

126
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:08,006
- Is she as good as people say?
- She's good because of this.

127
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,718
It's a very different kind of skill set,

128
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,804
and judges in family court
don't like bulldogs.

129
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,432
And so I think given that, she's good.

130
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,643
I mean, I think the straightest line
to get this resolved

131
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:24,732
- is just to have Mary Louise call it off. Mm...
- No. She's not gonna do that. She's not.

132
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:25,858
She might.

133
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,860
I need to take a crack at her.

134
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,611
- Okay? This is what I do.
- Renata.

135
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,740
- Yeah? We're in a meeting.
- Renata. I'm so sorry.

136
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:36,827
I just got a call from Suzie Jenkins,
San Francisco Magazine,

137
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,455
and please don't shoot the messenger.

138
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:45,669
They are not going to include you
in the "Women in Power" piece.

139
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,882
I'm sorry?

140
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,260
- Did she say why?
- Um...

141
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,055
The bankruptcy thing.

142
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,058
- Listen, I can step out.
- No, no, my God, no. No.

143
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,393
No. Stay right there.

144
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:04,146
They said it's not the story
that they're telling.

145
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,733
She just said the focus is women on top.

146
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,114
- I'm so sorry. I...
- No, I mean, my God, it's not your fault.

147
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,909
- I know, I just feel terrible...
- I said it's not your fault!

148
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,328
Can you excuse us?

149
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,622
I can make you some
Africa Zimbabwe tea.

150
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,081
If you just stop talking.

151
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,584
Okay, I'm gonna go away.

152
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,835
That would be best.

153
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,963
Are you okay?

154
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,466
I am not okay, Celeste.

155
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,802
Well, I mean, it's just a magazine article.

156
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,013
It's not just a magazine.
It's Women in Power!

157
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,265
I mean, we're supposed to be
on each other's side,

158
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,267
and they're backstabbing sluts.

159
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,319
"Ziggy." That's a dumb ass name.

160
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,363
My brother knows about you.

161
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,448
He said you have a hot mom.
Is that true?

162
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,410
You know you're a mistake, right?

163
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,289
Come on, pussy boy.

164
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,373
Say something.

165
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,547
What's going on?

166
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,048
Beat it. I'm talking to someone.

167
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,716
Leave my brother alone.

168
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,427
He's your brother?
That means your dad's a rapist.

169
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,681
- Get the hell out of here!
- Make me.

170
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,323
His name is Brian McPherson.

171
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,994
He is a bit difficult,
and he has bullied others.

172
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,622
But he's the one sitting in the hospital
getting his lip stitched up.

173
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,706
Oh, my God.

174
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,377
- I'm suspending all four boys.
- What?

175
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,130
It's just three days.
While we investigate...

176
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,965
Investigate? Why didn't you do that first?

177
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,134
It was three against one.
The boy got hurt.

178
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,760
My hands are tied.

179
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,190
You need to tell me
what he said to you.

180
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,027
Hey. Uh-uh. Look at me.

181
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,320
What did he say?

182
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,697
- I told you. I can't remember.
- Ziggy.

183
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,287
He said my father's a rapist.

184
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,364
Answer me!

185
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:03,388
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

186
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,280
I'll take over.

187
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,993
Okay.

188
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,372
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

189
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,752
Be open-minded, okay?

190
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,171
- Look at the view.
- It is pretty.

191
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,298
And they have a fireplace.

192
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,135
So you're gonna wander the space.
We're not moving in a circle.

193
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,761
We're exploring the space,

194
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,848
and when you come face-to-face
with someone you'd like to hug,

195
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:13,437
give them a hug for about the length
of a nice inhale, exhale. Okay?

196
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,147
Good.

197
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,364
Thank you.

198
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,577
Thank you.

199
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,498
Oh, my God.

200
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,127
That was awful. I'm so sorry.

201
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,505
Thank you for at least agreeing to try.

202
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,136
You're a really good man.
Good husband, good father.

203
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,183
I was a sound choice.

204
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,186
What are you saying?

205
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,690
- What? What are you trying to say?
- I've said it many times, Madeline.

206
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,194
Saying it one more time
is not gonna kill you, is it?

207
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:07,032
Nathan broke your world,
which at its core is family.

208
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,160
- You've said it many times.
- I know. I've said it many, many times.

209
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,706
- Is it a fucking crime?
- I didn't say it was a fucking crime.

210
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,875
Okay, then,
what are you trying to say to me?

211
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,795
Please just tell me. I have no idea.

212
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,590
On our first dates,
it was like you were interviewing me.

213
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,305
Not so much for the soulmate position
or lover.

214
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,642
But rather, father.

215
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,519
The stable provider.

216
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:41,775
Abigail was ripped apart
and you were determined to fix that.

217
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:46,154
To not make the mistake
of going down the lust path again.

218
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:51,034
You had a certain criteria,
and I checked all the boxes.

219
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:55,455
So you made the sound, practical choice.

220
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,417
It's not something
I couldn't make peace with. I did.

221
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,381
But then you got unsound.

222
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:10,887
You decided to make impractical choices,
one being to fuck Joseph Bachman,

223
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,099
which left me
with the most difficult choice of all:

224
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:20,147
to walk out with my dignity or to stay
with a woman who I simply cannot trust.

225
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,577
You can trust me to love you.

226
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,331
More deeply
than I've ever loved anybody.

227
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,920
Can you trust me
not to fuck things up again?

228
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,004
Maybe not.

229
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,967
I don't know
if I can trust myself with that.

230
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,470
I didn't trust my parents' marriage,

231
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:57,100
and the one I had with Nathan
was not to be believed.

232
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,105
And I don't know what itis, I don't...

233
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,233
Maybe it's some unconscious,
preemptive thing

234
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,361
where I wanna be the destroyer,
not the destroyee.

235
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:13,283
I don't understand,
and I racked my brain about it, but I...

236
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,623
Because all I really want
is to be married to you.

237
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,336
Just happily married to you.

238
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:30,217
But I must have low self-esteem
or I fucking hate myself or something

239
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,927
because look what I've done.

240
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,807
If I fuck up again,
it will not be with infidelity.

241
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,184
I give you my word.

242
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,647
All my future mistakes
will be brand-new ones.

243
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:59,579
They said it was ultimately a smear on the
entire publication if I was in this article.

244
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,668
I'm sorry. That sucks.

245
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,799
You know,
it might actually be for the best.

246
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,925
What?

247
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,679
L... The article would have put a target
right on your back.

248
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,974
I've spent my entire life
with a bull's-eye on my back.

249
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,517
This is one I wanted.

250
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
That's for me.

251
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,897
Coming!

252
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,024
- Oh, Mary Louise.
- Hello.

253
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,237
- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

254
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,949
Pleasure's mine. I don't often
get invited for tea in this neck.

255
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,494
Well, please. Please. Um...

256
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,330
What kind of tea would you like?

257
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:47,210
Again, I just... I wanna say I really
appreciate you coming because, um...

258
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:52,465
I know there's a lot going on, and,
uh, it must be so unbearably difficult.

259
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,676
It is. Thank you for...

260
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,013
For understanding that.

261
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,222
Of course. My God.

262
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,434
And listen, just between you and me,
I did want us...

263
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:07,355
I was hoping
this would just be about tea.

264
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:11,151
But people don't do that anymore.
Do they?

265
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,237
Uh...

266
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,321
Do what?

267
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,866
Just enjoy each other's company.

268
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,743
Just no agenda.

269
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:24,414
It would be so nice
if people could just be together, you know.

270
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,251
But maybe somebody will invent an app
for that.

271
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,880
Well, um, can I...

272
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,091
talk to you?

273
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,385
Just mother to mother.

274
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,845
I would like that.

275
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,598
Great. And thinking about
everything that's going on...

276
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,224
What happened to your furniture?

277
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,354
I mean, it's such a big house, you would
think there would be a lot of furniture.

278
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,648
Well, we're going through
a little bankruptcy thing right now,

279
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:51,900
which is almost resolved.

280
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,444
- But, um...
- Oh, that sounds awful.

281
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,863
- Well...
- But you work, don't you, Renata?

282
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,907
- I do. Yes.
- Yeah.

283
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,828
That must be especially devastating
for a working mom

284
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,914
to lose her house, her belongings,

285
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:11,669
because just to think about the sacrifice...
You know, all the missed dinners with kids,

286
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,590
and the not being able to host
the after-school play dates,

287
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,511
there's just so many,
many moments lost.

288
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,639
And for what? A screening room.

289
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,016
Maybe a boat.

290
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,477
Sorry.

291
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,482
You were saying... Oh. Mother to mother?

292
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,485
Are you placing judgment
on my life choices?

293
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,946
I don't know your life choices.

294
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,032
I don't know you,
other than you're a friend of Celeste,

295
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:47,247
and you seem like a very nice person
who lives in a big house with no furniture.

296
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,713
This is a serious situation and the boy
needed stitches, so I need to know.

297
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,549
Who instigated the fight?

298
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,551
Was it you, Max?

299
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,970
- Was it?
- He was saying stuff about Dad.

300
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,472
And he was picking on Ziggy.

301
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,556
So, what?

302
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,853
So the three of you attacked him?
You ganged up on him?

303
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,189
You can't do that.
Violence is not the answer.

304
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,859
Look at me. You think it is?

305
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,992
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

306
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,618
Stop being such a bitch.

307
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,371
Don't talk to me like that!

308
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,790
You do not talk to me like that!

309
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,421
Come here. Stop it.
You can't talk to your mother like that.

310
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,423
You can't talk to me like that.

311
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,468
Do you understand me?

312
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,387
It's not right.

313
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:06,326
I have an appointment tonight.
Kelly's gonna be here in a minute to sit.

314
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,702
What kind of appointment?

315
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,789
Oh, um...

316
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,461
With a lawyer.

317
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:25,011
Your grandmother thinks it would be better
if you lived with her for a little while,

318
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,223
and I disagree, and it's...

319
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,517
Why does she think that?

320
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,771
Because I... I don't know.

321
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,858
- We're not gonna live here anymore?
- No, you're gonna live here.

322
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:43,112
We have to have a judge decide, and
that's what I have to go and do tonight.

323
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,740
I don't wanna live with Grandma.

324
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,785
I don't want you to live with Grandma
and you're not going to.

325
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,495
You will be living here.

326
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:57,877

You will absolutely be living here.

00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,099
Well, um...

343
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,270
Not your mother.

344
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,481
I think we need to get her out
of this hospital.

345
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,316
Aren't they moving her to rehab?

346
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,401
Which means
they're throwing their hands up.

347
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,404
- They don't think she'll get better?
- We need to do something.

348
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,783
Look at you, getting involved.

349
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,866
Wow.

350
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,327
I gotta go.

351
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:00,208
- Dad.
- You don't think I got involved?

352
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,503
That I didn't protect you?

353
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,673
- No, Dad, I don't.
- If you only goddamn knew.

354
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,550
I do goddamn know. I was there.

355
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,845
Did you diffuse things? Sure.

356
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,308
Did you stop shit from getting worse?
Sometimes. But did you protect me?

357
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:28,069
♪ We've come too far
to leave it all behind ♪

358
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,656
Well, thank you for agreeing to meet.

359
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,991
I'll get right to the point.

360
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,871
There are only losers
in procedures like these,

361
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,917
and the biggest ones, invariably,
being the children.

362
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,422
So my suggestion is that we agree
to joint custody, one where...

363
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,007
- No. No. No.
- Just hear me out, please. Hear me out.

364
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,844
One where weekdays with you...

365
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,555
- Are you kidding me? No.
- Hear me out. No, just hear me out.

366
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:59,767
Weekdays with you. Weekends
with my client, Saturdays and Sundays.

367
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,352
- What?
- You would seek treatment

368
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,647
for drug and alcohol dependency,
as well as anger management.

369
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,774
- Once you... Well, there you go.
- Fuck you.

370
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,569
Now, these things will come up,
Mrs. Wright.

371
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,945
Is that a threat?

372
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,071
That's a fact.

373
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,160
You... You're not getting my boys.

374
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:21,372
Not for a Saturday, not for a Sunday,
not for a fucking minute.

375
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,666
Did you really expect me to accept this?

376
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,919
How are the boys doing?

377
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,006
You know,
we don't want this to go to court.

378
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,927
There will be no joint custody.

379
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:39,140
I see silence continues
to be your weapon of choice.

380
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:43,102
- Exactly what am I paying you for?
- It was actually a decent offer.

381
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,313
- No.
- There are so many possibilities

382
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,273
should this go to court, Celeste.

383
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,941
A lot of them bad.

384
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,238
- You said we should win.
- We should.

385
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:58,117
But we could also lose. The offer
we just got is a win in my opinion.

386
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,827
Oh, God.

387
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,455
There's also...

388
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:04,998
What?

389
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,795
- What?
- Your husband's death.

390
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,756
It will come up.

391
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,137
Shit.

392
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,438
There's gonna be a guardianship hearing.

393
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:32,610
I'm gonna have to testify, and that means
that I'm fair game on everything.

394
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,655
- Fuck, you're right.
- And Katie is pretty much convinced

395
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,616
- that Farber is getting help from the police.
- She is?

396
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,868
- What?
- Christ.

397
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:46,123
So, basically, he's an agent for them,
and I suppose they can ask me anything.

398
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,333
- Under oath.
- Yeah.

399
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,794
- Oh, my God.
- And if I get caught in, like, a lie

400
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,796
or something, then they have a case.

401
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,758
- Can you just plead the Fifth?
- No, I'll lose my kids, Madeline.

402
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:56,842
That's true.

403
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,014
And they have this witness list with you.
You were all on the list.

404
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,642
But why would they call us?
We're on your side.

405
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,603
Madeline, please.
It's a fucking perjury trap.

406
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:11,899
That's what they would do. They'd call us to
the stand to testify to Celeste's fitness.

407
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,652
- Yeah.
- Then under oath, they say, "Oh, by the way,

408
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,863
- how did Perry Wright fall down the stairs?"
- No.

409
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:17,989
- Yes.
- Can they do that?

410
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,408
- Yes.
- Okay, but then we just stick with our story.

411
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,076
That's perjury, babe.

412
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,287
Okay, but they'd have to prove
we were lying.

413
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,997
They probably can't.

414
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,623
What if they can?

415
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,960
I'm just telling you this
because we have to be prepared.

416
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,464
Look, we have to stick together.

417
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,175
That's the only way we've gotten this far.

418
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,636
If we stick together, we'll be fine.

419
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,971
We're gonna be fine.

420
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,356
Thank you again. He really likes you.

421
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,482
You're welcome.

422
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,401
Any time. He's a pleasure.

423
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,364
Still up?

424
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,535
And on your iPad, I see,
which you're not supposed to have at night.

425
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:05,661
Can I please have that?

426
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:07,954
Thank you.

427
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,755
Listen, um,
me and you are gonna have breakfast

428
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,883
with Max and Josh in the morning.
I have to work for a few hours,

429
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,969
but I'm gonna get off early
and I'll meet you guys at Whaler's Cove,

430
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,846
I don't know, sometime in the afternoon.

431
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:29,018
And then you, me, Celeste, and the boys
are gonna go kayaking.

432
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,396
- Cool.
- It's not a reward for bad behavior.

433
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,734
I just figured since you're suspended,
I mean, we might as well get some exercise.

434
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,782
You like Corey, right?

435
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,450
Mm-hm.

436
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,702
Yeah, I do.

437
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,162
Me too.

438
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,372
That's good.

439
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,043
Am I gonna grow up to be like him?

440
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,295
- Like Corey?
- No.

441
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,922
Like my father.

442
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,258
No. God, no, baby.

443
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:08,099
And you are gonna grow up
to be the sweetest, kindest,

444
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:13,980
most handsome, funniest, loveliest,

445
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:17,525
adorablest man.

446
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,776
I promise you that.

447
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,027
Thanks, Mom.

448
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,071
I love you.

449
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,596
Baby?

450
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,896
He's at the hospital, sitting vigilantly.
He wanted us to take a break.

451
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,231
Sweet.

452
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,987
I was protecting you.

453
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:06,866
Or so I thought.

454
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,952
Best way I could, by keeping the peace.

455
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,538
It's okay, Dad.

456
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,291
I know how weak I must seem to you.

457
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,465
But I was just trying to do whatever I
could to make the rage go away. For you.

458
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:26,718
And for me.

459
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,680
- Okay.
- And for her.

460
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,860
She started to talk this afternoon.

461
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:44,903
To mumble.

462
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,078
I had no idea what she was trying to say.
Uh...

463
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,789
She tried and she tried,
and finally, I got it.

464
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:55,915
What did she say?

465
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,001
She said you're drowning.

466
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:07,009
Sometimes the things she feels and sees
turn out to be right, and now I'm worried.

467
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,093
Dad.

468
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,349
- What's going on?
- I'm just gonna go check on Skye.

469
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,605
Why is Grandma doing this?

470
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:31,617
Because I think she's worried
that I'm still sad over missing your daddy,

471
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,619
and she...

472
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:46,090
She thinks that my sadness
isn't always good for you two.

473
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:50,761
So she thinks it would be better
if you lived with her.

474
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:54,765
For a while, while I get over my sadness.

475
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,935
Do you think that?

476
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,563
No.

477
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,650
Mm-mm. I do not think that.

478
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:10,114
So I don't know what kind of questions
this doctor is gonna ask,

479
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,408
but if she asks you,

480
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,453
who you would prefer to live with,

481
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,127
then it's really important
that you say you wanna live here.

482
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,881
Because she might tell the judge?

483
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:27,840
Exactly.

484
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,675
She might tell the judge.

485
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:35,139
Well, shall we say
we don't like Grandma?

486
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,895
No, don't say that.

487
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,193
We can protect you.

488
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:49,903
Yeah.

489
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,616
We can say whatever you want us to say.

490
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:57,912
Listen to me.

491
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,333
You do not need to protect me.

492
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,834
All right?

493
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:12,009
You just have to tell the truth
that you wanna live here.

494
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,385
Okay.

495
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,469
Okay.

496
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,387
I love you.

497
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,018
Get good sleep.

498
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,394
Big day tomorrow.

499
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,688
Good night, Mom.

500
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,607
- Good night.
- Good night.

501
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,238
Hey, Sweet Pea.

502
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,865
How come I'm not at school?

503
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,869
Sweetie, I told you.

504
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:43,540
Ziggy and Max and Josh are having
their special day with their moms,

505
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:47,836
and I thought, "Well, wait a minute.
Let's us have a mother-daughter day."

506
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,548
This is because we're broke, isn't it?
And we have to move.

507
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:55,261
No, Amabella, it's because I wanted
to spend the day with you.

508
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,931
Sweetie, everything isn't about money.

509
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,185
Well, it is, but it isn't.

510
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,605
What matters is this.

511
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:09,108
Your family, your friends...

512
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:15,281
Now, when you're ready, I will
race you to that pool, we will dive in,

- Okay.

Don't worry.

516
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,255
Do you and Ed have another plan?

517
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,589
No, not yet.

518
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:35,718
You know what I was thinking?
He loves to golf, so I'll learn to golf,

519
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,221
- something we can do together.
- Why would you wanna golf? You hate golf.

520
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,306
True.

521
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,766
But I took a vow. For better or worse.

522
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,103
- All right, all over your face.
- No, it's not. It's fine.

00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,188

This is my daughter, Abigail.
This is Mary Louise Wright.

00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:57,239
- Mm...
- Can I say something?

528
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,240
Of course.

529
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,243
