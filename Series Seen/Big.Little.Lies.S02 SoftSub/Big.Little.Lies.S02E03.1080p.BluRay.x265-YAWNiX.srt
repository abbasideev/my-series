Ed?

32
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,011
I fucked up.

33
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,349
There's no other way to say it.

34
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:07,021
And I don't think that I'm gonna wrap it
in a bow and make it better,

35
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,358
but I'm desperate to fix it.

36
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,362
Have you considered why you strayed?

37
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,282
How's your husband
to trust it won't happen again?

38
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,910
- Because it won't.
- How can he trust that?

39
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,413
- Why should he?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,667
We'll turn to your betrayal in a minute.

41
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,002
My betrayal?

42
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:34,423
Adultery is one form of infidelity.
Indifference is another.

43
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:38,761
You describe yourself as a go-along,
get-along, don't-make-waves kind of guy.

44
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:43,307
That makes you either wonderfully
accommodating or profoundly disengaged.

45
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,895
Could it be Madeline was just trying
to get your attention?

46
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,148
She has always had my attention.

47
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,321
Devotion on my end
has not been a problem.

48
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,078
Why were you unfaithful?

49
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,330
- I don't know.
- If you were to guess?

50
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,291
Should I guess?

51
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,503
You don't believe in you.

52
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,505
How can you trust the relational equation

53
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,632
when you have no faith
in the sum part of you?

54
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,010
- Math's not my strong suit, so...
- Because you didn't go to college?

55
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,011
I'm sorry?

56
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,765
You spoke earlier of your daughter
not wanting to go to college.

57
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,059
Does that have something to do
with her perception...?

58
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,562
I don't see where that is relevant.

59
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:30,896
Did you go to college?

60
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,360
Again, I don't see the connection
between what's going on...

61
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:40,322
Abigail will be nothing without college
perhaps because you are?

62
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,996
Have you been feeding her this?

63
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,457
Why did your first husband leave you?

64
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,917
Because he's an asshole.

65
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,798
Tell me about your parents.
What was their marriage like?

66
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,008
- Fine.
- Fine?

67
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,637
- Married for 40 years.
- Forty years. You talk to them much?

68
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,401
You have to be able
to hold your breath, baby.

69
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,278
But I don't like it.

70
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,698
You know what?

71
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,075
I hate getting my head wet too,

72
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,244
we have to be able to hold our breath
underwater

73
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,955
so if something ever happens,
we don't drown, baby.

74
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,419
I don't want to.

75
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,221
Maybe when I was 3, 4,
I walked into my parent's bedroom,

76
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:50,351
and my dad was having sex with a woman
that wasn't my mom.

77
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,855
And they were making all kinds of noises,
and then I got scared.

78
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,315
And what happened?

79
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,109
He pulled me out.

80
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,569
- Oh.
- Um...

81
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,281
And closed the door, and he said:

82
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,910
"There are things
your mother doesn't ever need to know."

83
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,579
- And you've never talked about it?
- No.

84
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:18,754
I guess that maybe that's why
I was so devastated when Nathan left me.

85
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,175
Because it confirmed
my biggest fear about marriage.

86
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,971
It's not to be trusted.

87
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,890
I wouldn't give up on Ed.

88
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,477
All right?

89
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,521
I really fucked up.

90
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,148
He's not gonna leave you. Not Ed.

91
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,028
How are you doing?

92
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,074
Have you had
any more early morning joyrides?

93
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,160
Funny.

94
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:54,248
No, I'm not being funny.
It actually really scared me.

95
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,458
What did Madam Shrink have to say
about that?

96
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,253
She thinks it's somehow tied to me...

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,049
not being sufficiently over Perry.

98
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,970
Life just feels colorless now.

99
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,472
It just feels flat and dull.

100
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:17,688
As dead as he is,
sometimes I think maybe I'm deader.

101
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,441
I was a better mother.

102
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,193
- No. Honey...
- I was a better mother with him. I was.

103
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,654
- No. Don't say that.
- Yes. I was.

104
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,034
I need to find joy for them.

105
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,829
And he helps me with that.

106
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,551
Jane.

107
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,553
- Yeah?
- I'm Mary Louise Wright.

108
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,929
Uh, we may have met.

109
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,641
- I'm Max and Josh's grandmother.
- Yeah, hi.

110
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,478
I'm sorry to trouble you
here at work, but, um...

111
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:02,650
Celeste has shared with me
some interesting news.

112
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,861
How would you feel
about submitting to a paternity test?

113
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,740
I mean, submitting Ziggy
to a paternity test.

114
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,912
Uh, yeah,
I don't need to take a paternity test.

115
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,997
I know exactly who my son's father is.

116
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,833
- Hmm. Even so...
- I'm not asking you for anything.

117
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,710
No, I realize that.

118
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,462
I suppose I'm asking.

119
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,547
For what?

120
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:30,427
Well, I'm presented with the idea
that my son was both an adulterer and a...

121
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,595
And a rapist.

122
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,015
And I am desperate to squash that idea.

123
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,937
Mm. Well, I can tell you
that he's the only man I'd been with.

124
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,271
That you recall.

125
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,731
Excuse me?

126
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,483
Things happen these days.

127
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,778
Men put drugs in pretty girls' drinks,
things happen.

128
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,905
People don't remember sometimes.

129
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:50,988
I remember.

130
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:52,991
Perfectly.

131
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,370
Far more vividly than I care to.

132
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,998
- Just a simple blood test.
- No.

133
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:11,969
What a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive.

134
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,930
But Charlotte didn't say that.
She said, "Some Pig."

135
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,974
She didn't say anything
about a tangled web.

136
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,892
She certainly spun one.

137
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,270
I mean, she made Wilbur out
to be an outlier

138
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,356
when in truth, he was kind of ordinary.

139
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,607
So, Ziggy...

140
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,777
does that make Charlotte a liar?

141
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,949
It makes her a grownup.

142
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,077
Lying to protect someone she loves,
that's what grownups do.

143
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:40,164
I think
she was probably just rebranding Wilbur.

144
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,749
Rebranding?

145
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,916
I see.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,837
- Well, you all wanna know what I think?
- Uh-huh.

147
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,175
I think Charlotte didn't want Wilbur
to get eaten.

148
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,763
I don't think she wanted any pigs
to be eaten, and we all know why, don't we?

149
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,265
Sustainability.

150
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,309
Exactly. Exactly.

151
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,188
How many gallons of water does it take
to make a single pound of sausage?

152
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,273
A thousand.

153
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,151
A thousand gallons. And how many
showers does that add up to?

154
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,778
Over 50.

155
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,155
Over 50 showers.

156
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,867
So imagine, you would have
to take a shower every single day

157
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,328
for almost two months to...

158
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,917
ETA about 10 minutes.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,170
Amabella, your mother's gonna
meet you at the hospital, okay, sweetie?

160
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,463
I wanna go with her.

161
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,924
We've got you covered.
Let me get her backpack.

162
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,092
What the fu... What happened?

163
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:39,139
- Mrs. Klein.
- What... I'm Amabella's mom. Renata Klein.

164
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,434
- What did she do? What's...?
- Mrs. Klein. I'm Dr. Feldman.

165
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,770
Your daughter was brought in
with an anxiety attack.

166
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,853
Anxiety attack?

167
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,274
We've given her a mild sedative,
she's resting, she's not in any danger.

168
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,944
She was in a little bit of a shock
when she first came in.

169
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,654
- What?
- She's fine. She's resting.

170
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,489
- Okay.
- Yeah. Right this way.

171
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,698
What did you do?

172
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:05,541
Did somebody hurt you
or say something or...?

173
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,001
No. I'm okay, Mom.

174
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,419
Sweetheart.

175
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:13,006
You were discovered in a closet
practically unconscious.

176
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,051
- Was she checked for bite marks?
- Honey, come on.

177
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,762
She was bitten last year, right?
So...

178
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,265
Maybe somebody's bullying you again or...

179
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,058
- No.
- Hey, baby,

180
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,309
you okay there, my girl?

181
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:28,564
Don't talk to her. I got this, okay?
I think you've done enough, don't you?

182
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,608
You...
What the hell are you talking about?

183
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,028
Gordon, she's obviously
under immense stress.

184
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,281
You think, Renata?

185
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,533
- Team. Team.
- Yes.

186
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,036
Hello, doctor. I would like my daughter
transferred to Stanford, please.

187
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,166
- Because?
- Because it's Stanford. I mean, please.

188
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,836
Well, she's being released.
She's cleared for discharge.

189
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,713
- Oh, well, look at that.
- There we go.

190
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,382
- Hey.
- Counseling is certainly indicated.

191
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,094
Perhaps for the entire family.

192
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,306
You don't know anything about my family.
Okay?

193
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,726
I know your own stress,
not helping the situation.

194
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,312
"Your own stress..."

195
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,395
Please.

196
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,733
Honey, isn't that great?
We're gonna go home.

197
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,318
- You're going home.
- Don't talk.

198
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,406
Will you ever forgive me?

199
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,159
Yes, of course, honey. It's not your fault.

200
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,952
I blurted it out.

201
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,079
The blurting is not the problem.

202
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,040
My doing it is the problem.

203
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,669
- You're in therapy, so that's good. Right?
- Yeah.

204
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:38,216
I mean, the doctor's pretty much a crock.
She...

205
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,887
She thinks I feel like an empty sack
because I didn't graduate from college,

206
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,473
and that's why I'm obsessed
with your going.

207
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,976
But that is not entirely true.

208
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,605
Mom... I mean,
when we would watch The Wizard of Oz,

209
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,943
you would turn into a puddle
every time The Scarecrow got his diploma.

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,617
Well, I'm glad you're back home.
Otherwise, I might be totally alone.

211
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,662
He's not gonna leave you.

212
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,210
Hello.

213
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,336
Oh.

214
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,173
We had such wonderful fun together.

215
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,384
- Did you, honey?
- Yeah.

216
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,095
- Can Dr. Peep have a sleepover?
- Oh.

217
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:28,642
Oh, sweetheart, I would love that,
but I need to get back to my sheep.

218
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,186
I'm afraid they'd miss me.

219
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,689
Could I talk to your parents
for a second in private?

220
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,357
Maybe you wanna go play outside?

221
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,818
- Look at the sunset.
- L promise to come see you again.

222
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,112
I'll bring tea and crumpets.

223
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,195
Cool.

224
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,573
I'll be right out.

225
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,744
We arranged all her stuffies
into a petting zoo. It was wonderful.

226
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,293
Nobody's bullying her.

227
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,713
- She's worried about the end of the planet.
- What?

228
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,048
Her class is evidently talking
about climate change,

229
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,509
she's gotten the message
that we're doomed.

230
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,885
- For fuck's sake.
- Oh, my God.

231
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,472
- You gotta be kidding me.
- She's also worried about you going to jail.

232
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:08,765
Well, hello.

233
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,976
And she's worried about you.

234
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,227
Me?

235
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,605
She thinks something is going on with you
and has been for a long time.

236
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,570
So there's you, you,
mostly the end of the world.

237
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,533
- Do you know if it's wild or farmed?
- I believe it's farmed.

238
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,036
- Land-based or net-pen?
- Sorry?

239
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,456
Were they raised on land-based facilities
or in net-pens in the ocean?

240
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,710
Well, um, it's a fish,
so I'm guessing the ocean.

241
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,086
Could you check?

242
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,922
- Sure.
- Thanks.

243
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,301
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

244
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,553
You have to be careful
with some of the farm shit.

245
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,555
So you just eat wild?

246
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,224
Yeah, yeah, mostly.
There's problems there too.

247
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,935
Some wild fish have tested positive
for microplastics.

248
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,521
Some wild salmon have tested positive
for antidepressants.

249
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,941
People have to ask
where the fish come from,

250
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,736
what they ate, how they lived,
even how they died.

251
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,532
If they're processed post-rigor, the
bacteria can leech right into the flesh.

252
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,955
- Sorry.
- No, you don't have to apologize.

253
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,793
I used to work at Santa Monica Seafood,
so I was really into all this shit.

254
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,420
It's great. And you're teaching me a lot.

255
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,090
- I'm trying to come off intelligent.
- It's working.

256
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,724
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry to be such a nuisance.

257
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,309
But I was just...

258
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,146
I was just wondering if there are any
new developments in the case.

259
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,276
We told you we would call if there were.

260
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,444
Yes.

261
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,154
Mm-hm.

262
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:50,742
I have personally worked very hard
to be mindful of your unspeakable pain.

263
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,452
I know you care.

264
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,413
I, perhaps, do seek out those who do.

265
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:59,459
I know you are not allowed
to say anything about the case,

266
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,754
or what you believe, but...

267
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,801
A mother need...

268
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,680
A mother needs to know.

269
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,186
You don't believe my son just slipped.

270
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,773
Do you?

271
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:29,281
You don't think it's healthy
to cling to the good memories?

272
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,783
It can be. I don't think so here.

273
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,744
But there are so many positives.

274
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,081
So many. The way he loved me,
the way he loved the boys.

275
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,833
The boys loved him. I...

276
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:45,255
I shouldn't erase all of that
simply because you feel that...

277
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,674
He almost killed you.

278
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,176
He didn't almost kill me.

279
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,761
He nearly smothered you with a cushion.

280
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:56,266
If one of his kicks had landed on
your head, you might very well be dead.

281
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,274
I work with,
and treat, quite a few veterans.

282
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,109
Many wanna return to combat.

283
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,778
They can't handle the mundane.
Normal life is dull.

284
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,617
You miss the war, Celeste.

285
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:19,039
I miss what was good.
I don't miss what was bad.

286
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:23,752
And keeping him in my heart, the good...
The good part of him, that works for me.

287
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,589
It works for the boys.
It works for my family. That works.

288
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,677
How did you get that bruise
on your arm?

289
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,555
- I broke up a fight between the boys.
- Mm-hm.

290
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,099
Last week.
I probably got whacked or something.

291
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,895
Do you self-inflict your bruises?

292
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,939
- What?
- It's not uncommon.

293
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:49,903
Victims of abuse, sometimes they feel
some attachment to their wounds.

294
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,740
Perhaps they remind you of him.

295
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,327
I do not self-inflict any wounds.

296
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,040
And your other patients
do not inform on me. I'm not a statistic.

297
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,543
Are you an addict, Celeste?

298
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,087
Is Perry your drug?

299
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,345
I think it's really neat
how passionate you are about things.

300
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,390
Thank you.
Are you passionate about things?

301
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,018
Um, yeah, of course, I am. You know, I...

302
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,188
I used to paint a lot.
I was really into art.

303
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:31,695
Now I'm mostly passionate
about my son.

304
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,654
I have a kid.

305
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:38,034
I probably should've told you that earlier,
but it's kind of a weird thing to bring up.

306
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,622
He's great. His name is Ziggy.
He's in second grade.

307
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,832
I would love to meet him.

308
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,584
Yeah, maybe one day.

309
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:52,465
I'm sure you guys would get along great.
He knows a lot of random shit too.

310
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,386
You guys could talk
about a lot of weird facts.

311
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,265
Um...

312
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,434
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

313
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,439
No, no, it's fine. It's, uh... not you.

314
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:15,780
I just gotta idle in neutral for a little
bit. That's kind of my MO right now.

315
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,324
- Neutral.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,201
Okay. I can do that.

317
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,176
I am the greatest

318
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,511
monster.

319
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:45,310
And I come to devour
two young chickadees!

320
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,812
My heavens.

321
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,275
He was the best monster.

322
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,820
- Show her the angry beaver.
- Yeah, let me see that one.

323
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,947
Did your mom make this for you?

324
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,240
We all did.

325
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,078
He sounds like a bear.

326
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,538
- He liked to combine animals.
- Yeah.

327
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,166
Oh, here's the teacup one.

328
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,876
How we doing here?

329
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,711
We're showing Grandma
the memory book.

330
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,088
It's wonderful.

331
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,424
Here's Guess How Much I Love You.

332
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:20,178
- That one's kind of boring.
- No, no, no. Let me. I wanna see that one.

333
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,097
We loved that book.

334
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,723
Okay.

335
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,935
"He was almost too sleepy
to think anymore.

336
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:31,731
Then he looked beyond the thorn bushes,
out into the big dark night.

337
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,985
Nothing could be farther than the sky.

338
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:41,282
'l love you right up to the moon,
' he said, and closed his eyes.

339
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:46,037
‘Oh, that's far. That is very, very far.'

340
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:50,708
Big Nutbrown Hare settled Little
Nutbrown Hare into his bed of leaves.

341
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,045
He leaned over and kissed him good night.
Right on the forehead."

342
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,646
Chloe said Amabella had a stroke.

343
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,691
She didn't have a stroke.
She had a panic attack. They're different.

344
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,901
She's totally okay.

345
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,737
And Max thinks
she got possessed by Satan.

346
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,534
You can tell Max that he's wrong because
Satan can only be so many places at once.

347
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,745
Come on, get in the car.

348
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,165
Let's go. Please get in the car.

349
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,248
Ziggy.

00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,877
- That's Perry's brother, Raymond?
- Yes.

356
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,464
- Oh, my God, he looks like Ziggy.
- It's uncanny, isn't it?

357
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:22,884
Oh, my God.

358
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,302
Wait, look.

359
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,972
They have the same cheeks.
That's crazy.

360
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,641
Wow.

361
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,267
It's...

362
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,771
a bit unsettling.

363
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,398
I should like to be in Ziggy's life. I...

364
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,529
I mean, I'm... I'm his grandmother.

365
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,863
Yeah.

366
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,575
I just needed a... Some time
to wrestle with that idea, but...

367
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:48,701
Is he sweet?

368
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,997
Yeah.

369
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,457
He's the best.

370
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,501
My boys were so sweet.

371
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:04,551
I don't think there was a gentler
or more tender little boy than Perry.

372
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,390
He was so sweet and gentle.

373
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,602
Grew up to be neither.

374
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,650
This is perhaps an unfair question.

375
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:26,781
On the night of your rendezvous
with my son, who initiated the encounter?

376
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,453
Uh... Does that make a difference?

377
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:36,749
I know how devoted he was to Celeste,

378
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:41,296
and I... I just can't conceive how he...

379
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,798
Unless he was tempted.

380
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,302
As men can be in a moment of weakness.

381
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,721
Did you initiate, Jane?

382
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:51,972
No.

383
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,062
You trying to apologize on his behalf?

384
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,565
To just justify what he did?

385
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,692
Celeste has shared with me

386
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:08,031
that she and Perry had a...
A complicated sex life,

387
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,075
- one that included violence.
- She shared that with you?

388
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,786
Yes.

389
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,996
And I'm...

390
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,166
It makes me wonder
if, perhaps, he misinterpreted

391
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,918
or misread a signal from you.

392
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:28,217
Your son raped me, and as he was doing so,
I was screaming for him to get off.

393
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,848
I don't think that you misread that.

394
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,770
I don't mean to offend you, I just...

395
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:43,232
[t... I can't surrender to this notion
that he was...

396
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,655
evil. I can't...

397
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,827
I just do so wanna believe
there was good in him.

398
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,537
I can't.

399
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,414
Did you see good in him?

400
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:04,337
Before the bad...
Did you see good in him?

401
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:12,361
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

402
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,879
It's literally like it couldn't be dumber.

403
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,798
I know. I know.

404
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,800
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

405
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,594
Yeah, I'm good. Good.

406
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,430
What are you doing?

407
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,306
Just, um, chatting.

408
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,475
Having some coffee.
What's up with you?

409
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,105
- You look better. Brighter.
- Thanks.

410
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,072
Um, I should get going to the studio.

411
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,366
Yeah, I'll let you guys...

412
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,909
All right.

413
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,412
Thanks for the chat and the laugh.

414
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,080
- Totally.
- I needed that, so...

415
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,207
- Good to see you.
- You too.

416
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,375
Bye.

417
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,960
- Bye, Maddie.
- Okay, bye.

418
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,256
I should probably get going too, here.

419
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,050
So, what were you talking about?

420
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,719
Her, uh, mother.

421
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,681
It seems everyone has mother issues.

422
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,770
How long are you gonna punish me?

423
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:49,859
Well, for as long as I
need or want, I guess.

424
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,236
Wow, that was just cold and mean

425
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,199
when just a few seconds ago,
you were so warm and friendly with Bonnie.

426
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,701
Yeah, I guess that would be a twofer,
wouldn't it?

427
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,537
Could piss off both you and Nathan
at the same time.

428
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,247
That's a good idea.

429
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,418
Well, that's just cruel, Ed.

430
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:09,545
And you're not cruel.

431
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:16,636
Well, whatever I am or have been
hasn't netted the desired results,

432
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,596
so why not mix it up?

433
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,769
I don't even know who he is right now.

434
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,771
He'll play through it. He will.

435
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,189
He just...

436
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,400
He's just being so hateful.

437
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,653
How could I think
anything about my life is real?

438
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,072
My first marriage was not real.

439
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,075
My second marriage,
turns out I'm the fraud.

440
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:44,038
I can't even believe in myself anymore,
and, like, look at my friendships and...

441
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:49,794
- What about your friendships?
- I had no clue, Celeste.

442
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,089
I didn't even have the slightest idea
that you were living through that,

443
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,424
and it makes me feel
like you couldn't even tell me.

444
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,261
- I'm sorry for keeping this secret. But I am.
- Don't say sorry.

445
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,931
- It's...
- If I was in your situation, I probably...

446
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,518
Probably what? Would have done
the same thing as me? Hmm?

447
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,437
- No, Madeline, you wouldn't.
- I don't know.

448
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,233
You would have been out of that marriage
so fast.

449
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,359
I wish.

450
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,028
I wish I had told you. I do.

451
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,534
You would have jumped into that pool,
pulled me out.

452
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,000
What possesses two idiots
like yourselves

453
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,669
to teach 8-year-olds
that the planet is doomed?

454
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,506
The children are constantly bombarded with
climate change. It is all over the news.

455
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,093
It's our job to deconstruct it
so that they can process it.

456
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:42,597
Good for you. You deconstructed
my little girl into a coma.

457
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,141
Renata, look,
we scheduled an assembly for this evening.

458
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,685
Okay?
You are not the only parent complaining.

459
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,604
Just, by far, the loudest.

460
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,522
You're pitiful.

461
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,692
Okay, this is gonna come
as a shock to you.

462
00:28:54,775 --> 00:29:01,198
This school is actually here to serve
all the children, not just Amabella.

463
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,327
You think
because of this whole bankruptcy thing

464
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,746
that the school thinks I don't matter?

465
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,080
Please.

466
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,624
I will be rich again.

467
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,875
I will rise up.

468
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,503
I will buy a fucking polar bear
for every kid in this school.

469
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:18,215
And then I will squish you
like the bug that you are.

470
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,719
Pretends like he's not a smoker.
Hasn't been laid in 15 fucking years.

471
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,220
Don't you talk to me like that.

472
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:26,015
And you,
I can't be bothered to squish you.

473
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,267
You're a model citizen, Renata.

474
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:31,103
I told you, these second-grade mothers,
they are Shakespearean.

475
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:35,608
That woman,
she's the fucking Medusa of Monterey.

476
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,653
- And, yes, I smoke. Do you want one of these?
- Yes, please.

477
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,572
Yeah, I got a spot outside
where the kids can't fucking see us.

478
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,116
- Fuck them. Oh, my God, I am so livid.
- Okay, let's...

479
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,827
- I am so livid.
- Let's go get a coffee or something.

480
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:50,331
- Please. The teacher was in on it.
- He really said, "Go to hell"?

481
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,791
- Yeah, he's a shit.
- Oh, my God.

482
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,711
They practically kill my daughter,
and then he's just dismissing me like that?

483
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,714
- What a puss-fuck. And then...
- Okay.

484
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,217
Mary Louise. Did you find a place?

485
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,719
- Maybe. Just saw one.
- Good, good, good.

486
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,346
You know Renata Klein?

487
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,681
- We do...
- Don't believe I do.

488
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,100
We... We did meet. At the funeral.

489
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:12,645
I'm so sorry. I was a friend of Perry's.

490
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,106
You were there. When he fell.

491
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,276
I was. That was, uh, devastating.

492
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,238
Mm-hm.

493
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,823
So sorry to interrupt.

494
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,617
Come on. Let's get out of here.

495
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,537
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know. She's very strange.

496
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,247
Whoo!

497
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,791
Jane.

498
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,209
- Hey.
- Hi.

499
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,044
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

500
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,504
- Going for a run.
- How are you?

501
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,716
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good. Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.

502
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,051
Ziggy's learning to surf.
Corey's teaching him.

503
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,095
- This is getting kind of serious.
- No.

504
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,390
Told Ziggy about him and told him
that he was teaching me to surf,

505
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,101
- so0, of course, he wanted to learn.
- Yeah.

506
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,937
Yeah. He did try to kiss me
the other night, though.

507
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,648
- And?
- It was extremely awkward.

508
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:00,776
I don't know. My body just shut down.

509
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,946
- Does he know about your history?
- Mm-mm. Not yet.

510
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,033
- You should talk to him.
- I don't know if I'm ready for that.

511
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,204
Look, any real relationship
you're gonna have, if you wanna have one,

512
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:16,250
- he's gotta know who you are, right?
- Yeah. I guess that's true.

513
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,254
What?

514
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:25,092
I'm such a hypocrite.
Nathan has no idea who I am.

515
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,139
Oh, my God! Go, Ziggy!
Go, baby, yes! Stand up!

516
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,142
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
You're doing it!

517
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,940
Turn that shit off.

518
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,367
Three things. One, we're throwing Amabella
a birthday party, and I'm sparing no cost.

519
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,786
She's unhappy.

520
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,872
Two, I had it out with Nippal.
I've gotta go back to the school.

521
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,042
They wanna talk about climate change
and the end of the world, which,

522
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,753
- if it comes, it might be a sweet relief.
- Damn right.

523
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:04,298
- And three, sell your fucking toys.
- It's not just me, you know.

524
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,801
- Excuse me?
- Putting stress on Amabella.

525
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,386
- What I did didn't help, of course, but...
- What did I do?

526
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,470
You tell me.

527
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:16,185
I mean, when I first met you, you had
your guardrails up to your earlobes.

528
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,437
- Please.
- Penetrating you was like...

529
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,523
It was like piercing a cement wall.

530
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,818
It took some time,
but I eventually chipped through, you know.

531
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,947
Well, guess what? The last, I don't know,
12 months or so, the guardrails are back up.

532
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,074
You are here, you're there,
you're everywhere,

533
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:34,161
but you are never present, and I feel it.

534
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,080
And Amabella feels it.

535
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,500
- Did she say that?
- I'm saying it.

536
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,418
Your husband is saying it.

537
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,715
There is something going on with you.

538
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,343
Correct.

539
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,471
My husband put us in the poorhouse.

540
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,806
Sell your shit.

541
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:59,353
First off, thank you all
for coming to a special evening assembly

542
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,439
at our wonderful, wonderful Otter Bay.

543
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:07,444
And a special thanks to those parents who
took special time out of their busy lives

544
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:10,823
to reach out to me directly
about this important issue, so thank you.

545
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,700
You're welcome. Yeah.

546
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:17,079
Now, as we all know,
anxiety is an epidemic in our schools.

547
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,623
Really? It wouldn't be
if you weren't teaching them...

548
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:23,043
Let's take a breath, and let's try
and keep this constructive, shall we?

549
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:27,423
Climate change
and the toll that it takes on our students,

550
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,383
it is a complicated matter, okay?

551
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:33,053
That is why we called this ad hoc
Golden Bell Award-winning assembly

552
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,932
because not only will you hear from me,
we would love to hear from you,

553
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:39,268
the parents. Okay, hold up.

554
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,062
We've already told you
how we feel about it.

555
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:45,816
This is not how I want this to go.
Everyone, please sit down.

556
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,026
Shut up!

557
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,446
Really?
Are you seriously telling us to shut up?

558
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,530
Madeline Mackenzie.

559
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:55,618
Okay, since you've taken this opportunity
to speak up, let us first hear from you.

560
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,537
- Would you like to come up here, please?
- Why me?

561
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,998
Because you're a beacon among us,
Madeline.

562
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,250
- Please, come up here. Thank you.
- Fine. I'm fine.

563
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,502
Make sure they know
my daughter was in a coma.

564
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,670
Okay. Okay, yeah.

565
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:09,131
Madeline Mackenzie,
everyone. Please.

566
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,721
Just share your thoughts.

567
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,352
I mean, where do we even begin? Honestly?

568
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,771
About everything?

569
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,691
I mean, Principal Nippal,
you have a very good point.

570
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,444
Climate change is important.
It's important.

571
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,031
But it's also a lot to load up
on a lot of second graders. I'm sorry.

572
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,201
- Yes.
- That the whole world might go kapooey.

573
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,911
They need to know that?

574
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,915
You know, I think part of the problem is,
we lie to our kids.

575
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:47,002
We fill their heads full of Santa Claus
and stories with happy endings,

576
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:51,173
when most of us know
most endings to most stories fucking suck.

577
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,175
Right? Let's just get real.

578
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,388
There aren't a lot of happy endings
for a lot of people, you know?

579
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:00,975
Be it climate change,
be it guns in schools.

580
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,645
And our kids are afraid.
They're afraid to go to school.

581
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,647
They're afraid they're gonna get shot.

582
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,107
We don't prepare them.

583
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,778
We fill their heads full of happy endings
and happy stories and lies.

584
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:19,201
And we tell them things like, "You're fine.
You're gonna be fine," we tell ourselves...

585
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:22,663
We tell ourselves we're gonna be fine.
But we're not.

586
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:27,835
You know that song we used to sing when
we were little, "The Rainbow Connection"?

587
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,921
There's a line in it,
they talk about rainbows are illusions.

588
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:35,301
And then there's another line,
and it goes on, and it says that,

589
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:42,391
"Who said every wish would be granted
would be if you wish on a morning star."

590
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,476
Do you remember that?

591
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,895
Because this is the part that I thought...

592
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,066
is that somebody thought of that.

593
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,070
That someone believed them.

594
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,448
And look what it's done.

595
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,451
We have to tell the children
that life is an illusion

596
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,745
and things don't work out sometimes,

597
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,706
and that you can't tell them
part of the truth.

598
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,125
You have to tell them the whole truth.

599
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,888
She's not picking up.

600
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:24,767
Is this a full-blown breakdown
or something? I mean...

601
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,519
Too much to get up there
and help her, Ed?

602
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,150
- Hmm? She's your fucking wife.
- Well, thanks for the tip, Celeste.

603
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,277
Maybe we could get coffee, you and me,

604
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,614
and you could fill me in
on whatever else I've missed.

605
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,620
You don't think he knows about...?

606
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,703
No.

607
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,721
Where is he?

608
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:03,805
I don't know.

609
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,725
Is he moving out?

610
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,230
Well, he hasn't packed his things yet.

611
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,033
Well, I heard...

612
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,787
about your speech tonight.

613
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,622
Can you get me some wine?

614
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,375
He'll be back.

615
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,133
Thank you, honey.

616
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,645
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

617
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,022
You gave me such a fright.

618
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,106
Well...

619
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,734
Okay, I won't lie.

620
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,736
I have been having trouble
sleeping of late,

621
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,866
and so I thought
you might have a little helper or two.

622
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,950
You're snooping.

623
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,911
You have quite an impressive array.

624
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,876
I think it's probably best
if you find another place.

625
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,753
Celeste, I am on your side.

626
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:19,339
So you keep saying.

627
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,341
Vicodin?

628
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:24,803
You have to be so careful
of these opioids, dear.

629
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,305
Sometimes I needed it.

630
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,891
For the pain.

631
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,733
Like when after he kicked me.

632
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,453
I had a really good time again.

633
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,632
I'm not gonna try and kiss you.

634
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,095
But I would like to give you
a good-night hug.

635
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,932
How does that sound?

636
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,141
That sounds great.

637
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,190
- Okay.
- This is a weird hug.

638
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,112
We're touching.

639
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,322
I'm blushing.

640
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,405
How's it going?

641
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,661
Are we dancing?

642
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:35,207
Is that what this is? Is that your secret
scheme? To get me to dance with you?

643
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,667
It's a really good idea, yeah.

644
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,754
I'm not that smooth, but, yeah, I guess
we could dance if you want to dance, sure.

645
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,066
Hey, Sparkles.

646
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,487
I'm just calling to say good night.

647
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,699
But you've probably already gone to bed.

648
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,620
I'm having a little trouble sleeping.

649
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,999
And I was hoping you could help me.

650
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,337
But I guess I'm on my own.

651
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,967
Though not really.

652
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,052
I can just close my eyes and...

653
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,473
And pretend that you're here.

654
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,479
I love you, baby.

655
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
