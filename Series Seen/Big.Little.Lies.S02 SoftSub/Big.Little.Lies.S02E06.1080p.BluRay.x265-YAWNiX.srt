No!

20
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,450
I pushed him.

21
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,412
- No, wait! Wait!
- L did it. I did it.

22
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:03,374
Listen to me. You did not push him.
And you did not push him.

23
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,711
No one did this. Nobody.

24
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,715
Call an ambulance!

25
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,143
What the fuck!

26
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,704
- You're a cop?
- No, I'm not a cop.

27
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,998
- Well, what the fuck were you doing there?
- I was...

28
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,750
- Bonnie saw you.
- Do you wanna come in?

29
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:49,920
I can explain.

30
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,590
- Yeah, you better fucking explain.
- Okay, um...

31
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,719
I was called in for questioning.

32
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,304
More like ordered.

33
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,305
By who?

34
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,723
Um...

35
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,476
- Detective Quinlan.
- What did she say?

36
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,936
She asked me about us and you

37
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,608
and she asked whether you had talked
to me about Perry Wright's death.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,944
What did you tell her?

39
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,405
I told her the truth,
that you didn't tell me anything.

40
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,700
But, Jane, she knows
your history with this guy.

41
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,495
She knows he raped you,
she knows he's Ziggy's dad,

42
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,122
and she clearly doesn't think he slipped.

43
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,129
She said with five witnesses,
the odds are in her favor,

44
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,965
one of you will finally crack.

45
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,886
The first one who does gets a break.
The other four are fucked.

46
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,185
He went to, uh...

47
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,815
To kick me again and...

48
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:56,487
And I think that's when he... He must
have taken a step back, and he fell.

49
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,201
I don't really remember
because he stumbled back.

50
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,581
And that must have been when he fell.

51
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,048
Is there anything else
that you would like to add?

52
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,721
I feel, um...

53
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,603
I just feel like...

54
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:36,986
I don't have a proper memory
of everything,

55
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,364
so that's why it's a little inconsistent.

56
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,661
But we're not gonna break. Right?

57
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,620
- No. Right.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,415
Okay, we're gonna keep our poise
and we're gonna stay calm...

59
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,877
Jesus Christ, a meteor could hit
and you would say, "Stay calm."

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,130
Oh, fuck off, Bonnie. You know what?
I'm so tired of taking care of you

61
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,840
- and your feelings.
- Oh, my God.

62
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,968
I know your mom had a stroke,
but you're the one who pushed him.

63
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,303
What the fuck you say to me?

64
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,888
- He slipped.
- Oh, my God.

65
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,556
- No one pushed anybody.
- All right.

66
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,766
- He slipped.
- Come on. Bonnie.

67
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,895
- He slipped, right? Right?
- He slipped. Right.

68
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,563
Right. Yeah.

69
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,316
- All right, let's go home. Come on.
- It's all right.

70
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,399
Jesus.

71
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,695
And so I started to run at him.

72
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,992
And the closer I got to him,

73
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,871
the more I knew what I had to do.

74
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,841
You're still here, huh?

75
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:44,220
Yeah, I left and came back.

76
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,097
Doctor's gonna be here shortly
with an update.

77
00:05:58,651 --> 00:05:59,735
You ready?

78
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:04,990
Because I'm not.

79
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,955
She's too damn young, for God's sake.

80
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,258
You're gonna fight this.

81
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,054
You hear me, baby?
You're gonna fight this.

82
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,366
What did you say?

83
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,744
Something in the vein of "Fuck off."

84
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,913
I know it was rude.

85
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,541
I feel bad. I just...

86
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,961
Why were you all out there?

87
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,797
This secret last-minute meeting.

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,219
Were you helping Celeste
prepare for her custody battle? Like...

89
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:10,889
Um, no, we were just being there for her,
you know.

90
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,517
- And at night?
- Solidarity. Yeah.

91
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:18,856
And during all this solidarity,
is that when "fuck off" came up, or...?

92
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,399
Mm-hm.

93
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,657
You know, the other day, when you talked
about hating yourself, there was honesty.

94
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,452
I mean, it gave me hope.

95
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,913
First time in a long
time, the air felt clear.

96
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,917
But right now,
it seems like the window is fogging up,

97
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,586
like you're hiding again.

98
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,227
- Mom?
- Hey.

99
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,647
It's cold.

100
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,315
Come here.

101
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,115
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

102
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,373
He knows
that I am lying about something.

103
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,957
We made a pact.

104
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,584
He's my husband.

105
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,295
It's a fucking pact, Madeline.

106
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,547
You don't tell anybody that.

107
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,759
I mean, you're the one that says
Ed's all about truth and honesty.

108
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,469
- He is.
- Oh, great.

109
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,722
So suppose he leads with that?
Are you kidding me?

110
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,141
Then we're fucked,
and Celeste is fucked first.

111
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,559
She'll lose her kids.

112
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,147
You cannot tell him that.

113
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,987
Yeah, it's not...

114
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,573
Hey, Kristen.
Uh, we have a seafood watch question.

115
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,785
The mom with the penguin kid
with the penguin hat.

116
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,911
You got it. Yeah.

117
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,376
So you're not gonna return my calls
or texts because I talked to the police?

118
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,003
No, it has nothing to do with the police.

119
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,589
I just can't do this right now.

120
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,096
Hey, who wants to touch
something prickly?

121
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,433
- Me.
- Okay. She's just to my left.

122
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,812
I'm just kidding. No, I'm kidding.
We have slimy kelp here.

123
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,836
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

124
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,292
I just want you to know how sorry I am
that it's come to this.

125
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,421
But at the end of the day,
we are still family, you know?

126
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,632
We're not family, Mary Louise.

127
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,427
All rise.

128
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,017
- Be seated.
- Okay.

129
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,979
I have before me the psychiatric reports,

130
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,191
together with the finding
of the child psychologist.

131
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,901
I am not satisfied.

132
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,448
As I stated at the outset,
the court takes these matters seriously.

133
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,784
As both a judge and a mother,

134
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm ill-inclined to remove these children
from the only home they've ever known.

135
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,873
That said, I do have concerns.

136
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,253
Both parties will be provided
copies of the reports today,

137
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,589
which I would like to enter into evidence
by joint stipulation.

138
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,802
Given the underlying neutrality of these
recommendations, I anticipate no objection.

139
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,182
All right. We will proceed
with the evidentiary hearing tomorrow.

140
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,893
Mrs. Wright?
I wish to first hear from you.

141
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,521
You will take the stand
and entertain questions from me

142
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,648
as well as the petitioner's counsel.

143
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,150
Your Honor,
I'd like to conduct a direct first.

144
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,904
Not necessary. You can
redirect after, should you feel the need.

145
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:39,366
Okay? See you all back here tomorrow.

146
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,413
Hey. No, come on.

147
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,583
We expected this. Come on. Come on.

148
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,006
- Are the boys gonna have to be here?
- Not for tomorrow, no.

149
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,887
Celeste. There is the risk
she could get full custody.

150
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,513
I'm not settling.

151
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,348
I am not settling.

152
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,019
- Okay.
- And don't try to handle me here.

153
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,315
- All right? Don't do that.
- Handle, no.

154
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,733
Advise, yes.

155
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,988
Farber's goal
will be to make you look erratic.

156
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,867
I can protect you some, you just
can't look like you need protection.

157
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,704
- Do you understand what I'm telling you?
- Yeah, of course. I'm on my own.

158
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,081
- That's what you're saying.
- You are not on your own.

159
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,791
But we need to be careful.

160
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,293
Get some rest.

161
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,135
There's nothing more we can do.

162
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,473
I'm afraid we just have to watch and wait.

163
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,183
Do you have any questions?

164
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,813
Can we kill her?

165
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,358
- Bonnie.
- She doesn't wanna exist like this.

166
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,068
We can't kill her.

167
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,197
I know it's done.
Pain management, we give her morphine.

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,533
That isn't the kind of pain we manage.

169
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,327
Morphine is not indicated here.

170
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,455
You'd do it for a dog.

171
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,831
- Bonnie.
- What?

172
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:10,915
Enough.

173
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,215
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

174
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,384
The hearing is open to the public?

175
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,303
No, Judge Marilyn Cipriani.

176
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,722
I wish I knew somebody
who knew somebody who knew her.

177
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,353
L, uh, said goodbye to Amabella.

178
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,313
Oh, Juliette...

179
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,857
I kind of told her
that I might be coming back,

180
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,402
you know, to soften the goodbye.

181
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,196
That was such a good idea. I know, it's...

182
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,491
Um, my... My lawyer said
I need to talk to you

183
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:49,204
- about the severance again.
- Oh, honey, I know... We know we owe it.

184
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:53,500
But now, it's...
It's in the bankruptcy trustee's hands.

185
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,628
So first things first,
we need to find you a new job.

186
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:59,006
Right,
you got our letter of recommendation?

187
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,925
- Yeah, I did. Thank you.
- Yep, sure. Of course.

188
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,846
- So I guess this is goodbye.
- Mm.

189
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,180
Mm-mm.

190
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,186
Let's not. No, it's not goodbye here.

191
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,817
Because we will rise up,
and when we do, we will hire you back.

192
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,527
- Okay.
- Okay?

193
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,862
Okay.

194
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,614
Oh, I couldn't have done this
without you, Juliette.

195
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,325
Yeah!

196
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,788
Yeah, baby!

197
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,584
- Good job, buddy.
- That was awesome.

198
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,003
Good job, high-five.

199
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,463
Oh, my God.

200
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,881
That was so cool.

201
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,090
I love that.

202
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,928
- Hey.
- What are you not doing in school?

203
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,307
- You're not suspended again, I hope.
- No, it's a parent-teacher conference.

204
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,435
Oh, cool. Well, you...
I saw you catch that wave.

205
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,520
You got it down.
You don't need my help, huh?

206
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,981
No, I still need your help.
I'm not that good.

207
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,317
She's been teaching me. Again.

208
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,612
- Both of you guys are so good at this.
- Hey, baby.

209
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,906
Do you wanna just build a sandcastle
for a minute?

210
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,325
- Give us a second to talk?
- Okay.

211
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,202
- Thank you.
- You guys wanna talk private.

212
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,871
- Yeah. Will you take a board? Thank you.
- All right.

213
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,539
-Make sure you got a moat
-Over here.

214
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,663
- To keep the people out.
- Your toys are over here.

215
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,377
- Hi.
- Hey.

216
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,050
So you're gonna freeze me out forever?

217
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,388
It's gonna take me a long time
to let someone in again.

218
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,684
I'm not walking away.

219
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,354
Mom, check this out.

220
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,446
- Bonnie, I...
- Metal in the pocket.

221
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,618
Look, I wanna apologize for the other day.
I was completely out of line.

222
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,788
Thanks. It's fine. We're going through
a lot of stuff, you know.

223
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,500
No, everything your mom is going through,
I had no right to speak to you like that.

224
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,420
And I want you to know if I can be helpful,
which I...

225
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,757
- I don't know how I could, but I wanna be.
- Thank you.

226
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,592
You okay?

227
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,724
Yeah, I'm good. Like what you said,
everyone's going through stuff, and I...

228
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,854
- I'm no exception.
- It's getting to you, isn't it?

229
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:19,937
What?

230
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,816
It's getting to you.

231
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,778
Every time. Every time.
I know how you feel.

232
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,530
It's like they put us on a list.

233
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:33,326
Please raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth,

234
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,496
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

235
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,540
- I do.
- Please be seated.

236
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,711
- Mr. Farber.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

237
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,173
The whole truth...

238
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,718
and nothing but the truth.

239
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,971
Do you have any questions concerning
the oath you just took, Mrs. Wright?

240
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,848
- None.
- Excellent.

241
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,100
And first off, my sympathies.

242
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,269
Your husband died.

243
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,980
And now this. That can't be easy.

244
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,900
In fact, it's not been easy for a
long time, has it, Mrs. Wright?

245
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,444
You were in an abusive relationship
with your husband.

246
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,448
- Yes.
- Physically abusive.

247
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,617
- Yes.
- Emotionally abusive.

248
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,077
- Yes.
- He hit you.

249
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,415
- Many times.
- Did you ever hit him?

250
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,711
I mean, sometimes I would fight back.

251
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,546
Did you ever hit him first?

252
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,343
It happened, but...

253
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,180
I mean, more typically,
he attacked me.

254
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,642
That must have been terrifying.
Was it ever thrilling?

255
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,186
Thrilling?

256
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,648
Did the physical violence
ever lead to sex?

257
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,191
Objection.

258
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,525
Overruled.

259
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:53,114
Did the physical violence ever occasion
you and your late husband to have sex?

260
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,534
- Yes.
- Great sex?

261
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,333
- You were aroused by the violence.
- I was not aroused by the violence.

262
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,668
You never said that?

263
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,836
That the incendiary exchanges
with your husband,

264
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,548
including the physical violence
led to gratifying and passionate sex,

265
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,758
did you ever say that?

266
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:18,431
My relationship with my husband
was very complicated.

267
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,350
Complicated.

268
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,269
Was it sick?

269
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,521
- It was not healthy.
- Are you over your sickness?

270
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,357
- Objection.
- Sustained.

271
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,109
Did you miss the violence?

272
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,861
No, I do not.

273
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:37,993
I... I miss my husband,
but I don't miss getting beat up.

274
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,202
So...

275
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,290
- So he beat you up often?
- He did.

276
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,418
Did you ever call the police?

277
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,839
- No.
- Never?

278
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,842
- Did you ever tell anybody?
- No.

279
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:58,096
You never told anybody
that your husband was hurting you?

280
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,974
- I told my therapist.
- Are you healed now?

281
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,851
- Objection.
- Sustained.

282
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,279
Do you, uh, recognize this man?

283
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,623
- Yes.
- What's his name?

284
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,544
- I don't know.
- Oh, not even a first name?

285
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,255
Um... Jeff.

286
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,592
Uh, Joe. Joe. It was Joe. I... I think.

287
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,261
Did you have sexual relationships
with Joe?

288
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,059
Um, I'd... I'd had a bit to drink.

289
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,479
So approximately how long after
you met Joe did the two of you have sex?

290
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,647
- Objection.
- Not long enough to get his name.

291
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,399
- Objection.
- Counsel.

292
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,319
Did this also get violent?

293
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,864
It was physical.

294
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,368
And are you really over your sickness?

295
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,578
- Objection.
- Sustained.

296
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,041
Do you recognize this man?

297
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,468
Michael Something.

298
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,804
Did you have sex
with Michael Something?

299
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,348
My social life is not... I mean, this is...

300
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,433
Did you have sex
with Michael Something?

301
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,851
Yes.

302
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,478
And it also got physical?

303
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,605
Um...

304
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,609
If anything, I was the aggressor.

305
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,363
Oh, so where did this aggressive sex
take place?

306
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,991
In a bathroom.

307
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,286
- A bathroom stall? A public bathroom stall?
- Yes. Yes.

308
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,205
How long
after you met Michael Something

309
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,916
did you have aggressive sex
in a public bathroom stall?

310
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,544
- Objection.
- Sustained.

311
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,796
In the interest of time, just...

312
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,758
And...

313
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,929
No, this...

314
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,097
Please.

315
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,349
Did you have sexual relations
with all these men?

316
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:11,813
Listen, this has nothing to do with
my capacity to parent my children. This...

317
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,815
Did your children ever meet
any of these men,

318
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,192
these sexual one-offs,
your boys ever meet them?

319
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,867
They... They met Joe.

320
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,201
No others?

321
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,495
Um, no.

322
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,041
Did you ever bring any of these men
home when the boys were there?

323
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,086
No. Um...

324
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,339
Well, once.

325
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:43,219
Once, I did, but, um, he was gone.
He was gone before they woke up, so...

326
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:47,098
So if Josh were to tell his grandmother,
"I tried to get into bed with Mommy,

327
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,225
but there was a stranger there,"
he'd be lying?

328
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,730
If he said, "I tried to wake Mommy up,
but I couldn't,

329
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,484
and the stranger told me to go back to my
room," that would just be his imagination?

330
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,030
Oh.

331
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,825
I mean, sometimes I, um,
have trouble sleeping,

332
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,203
and so I take Ambien, and that...

333
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,874
Have you ever driven while on Ambien
and run off the side of a road?

334
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,836
Um...

335
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,800
Your Honor, um...

336
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,346
- Your Honor.
- Answer me, please. Answer to me.

337
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,806
No, I would...
I would like to address the court.

338
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,642
- Go ahead.
- Um...

339
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,935
I have...

340
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,190
I drove off the road once.

341
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,650
I've struggled.

342
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,653
I've had difficulty
in the wake of my husband's death,

343
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,614
and I've engaged in... In...

344
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:49,118
In self-destructive
behavior, including, um...

345
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,125
- Including sexual encounters and...
- Celeste.

346
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,877
Please, let me, I'm...

347
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,004
I'm not gonna look you in the eye

348
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,174
and say that I'm healed,
but I will say this:

349
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,969
I am in the process of healing, and...

350
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,435
And through it all,
I've always been a good mother.

351
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,355
I've always put
my children's interests first,

352
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,985
and I've always, always kept them safe,
even when...

353
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,029
Perry... Even when...

354
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,033
there was a monster in the house.

355
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,744
Have you ever been violent
with your children, Mrs. Wright?

356
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,961
I overreacted on two occasions.

357
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,048
You ever strike your mother-in-law?

358
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,886
I slapped her in the face.

359
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,514
Ever push your husband
down a flight of stairs?

360
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,182
No!

361
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,143
And how dare you?

362
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,811
How dare you?

363
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,609
This is a computer simulation
of your husband's fatal fall.

364
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,444
Objection. Relevance,

365
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,863
- not to mention unfair surprise.
- Take a de bene.

366
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,617
- This is off-the-charts prejudicial.
- This isn't a jury trial, counsel,

367
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,994
I'll give you time to impeach if you want.

368
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,371
This is where your husband
would have landed

369
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,665
from a natural fall.

370
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,167
Now, this is where he did land.

371
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,588
Oh...

372
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:24,713
This is...

373
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,634
Mm.

374
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,387
The physics say

375
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,806
that for him to have landed there,

376
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,142
he must have been pushed.

377
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,936
So I dare to ask...

378
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,814
did you push him?

379
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,858
No. I did not.

380
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,236
How did he fall?

381
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,864
He lost his balance and he slipped.

382
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,951
He lost his balance
immediately after you found out

383
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:57,872
he'd been unfaithful with another woman
who bore his child?

384
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,916
- Not relevant.
- Not relevant?

385
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,293
- She might commit a homicide, but hey.
- Objection.

386
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,922
All right, the objection
on relevance is sustained.

387
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,050
Thank you, Your Honor.
I have no further questions. Thank you.

388
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,514
Okay.

389
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:15,682
Shit.

390
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,436
God, Katie,
you couldn't have cut any of that off?

391
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,856
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God, she was having me followed.

392
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,608
- She was having me followed.
- I know.

393
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,986
- Unbelievable.
- She had Pls on me. God.

394
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,321
This is just...

395
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,283
Okay, that was rougher than we thought.

396
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,993
You think?

397
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,077
Jesus Christ.

398
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,414
I'll need to put you
back on the stand.

399
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,332
- No...
- I need to rehabilitate you.

400
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,084
Deconstruct a lot of what just happened.

401
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,837
I don't think I can get back
in that chair.

402
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,925
I'm sorry, but I think you have to.
You can't leave it like that. You can't.

403
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,637
And you've been through so much, honey,
but you have to fight for those boys.

404
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,264
You can't leave it like that.

405
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,349
I dare to ask,

406
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,853
did you ever push your husband
down a flight of stairs?

407
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,522
- I did.
- You have to fight for them.

408
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,898
They need you.

409
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,426
Well, I must say I was surprised
to hear from you.

410
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,474
I have no intention
of doing anything, okay?

411
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:41,933
Okay.

412
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:46,063
All right, part of me does want
to do something,

413
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:51,068
but I've already done it,
just by entertaining the idea even...

414
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,822
for a few minutes, I've done it.

415
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,617
Look, let me tell you
what my shrink told me.

416
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,413
It's not about inflicting payback
on your cheating spouse.

417
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:07,335
It's about getting a sense
that you didn't just take it.

418
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,212
You didn't just swallow your pride

419
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,256
and resign yourself
to being some wimpy ass victim.

420
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,342
But you are looking for payback.

421
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,428
True. I'd like both
Joseph and Madeline to pay.

422
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,764
But I'm also attracted to you.

423
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,481
I keep both a masturbation diary
and a bucket list.

424
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,150
- Lower your...
- You made both.

425
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,528
It's not just about me getting even.

426
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,322
It's about me getting you.

427
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,698
I want you.

428
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,079
Don't overthink it.

429
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,499
We have sex.

430
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,543
We'll probably love it.

431
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,045
If we don't, we move on.

432
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,465
Of course, if we do love it...

433
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,094
we do it again.

434
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,428
And again.

435
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,805

I just hope I can convince you
that I'm incapable

442
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,514
of doing something...

443

Neither can you.

449

What are you doing?

450
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,726
You know she's a good mother.
Call this off.

00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,227
Oh, I know.

452
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:35,066
I thought about doing exactly that.
I really did.

453
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,193
But then, I...

454
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,280
I considered the boys and...

455
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,367
She's not well. Clearly, you can see that.

456
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,120
No, what I see is a woman
who's struggling. Who isn't?

457
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,666
Are you struggling, Jane?

458
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,919
With your conscience, perhaps?

459
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,257
Ziggy told me you purchased a gun.

460
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,135
Did you plan to use it on my son?

461
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,263
Did you move to Monterey
to hunt him down?

462
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,476
Actually, I came to Monterey
in search of a good man.

463
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,021
A good man who happened
to have a bad night. Do you know

464
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,649
the difficulty that my son
is gonna have to face

465
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,569
being a product of rape
because of your fucking son?

466
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,780
He was not a good man!

467
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,949
Yeah, maybe I would have
fucking shot him.

468
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,034
I didn't get the fucking chance!

469
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,455
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,748

471
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,092
Sounds like somebody's having a party.

472
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,680
Uh, you go ahead
and put your mom's food on the counter.

473
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,265

I can explain.

481
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,791
I was just cleaning out my closet,

482
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:00,044
you know, and I found my wedding dress
in the back.

483
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,588
Just kind of reminded me
of a certain time

484
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,924
when I was a different person and...

485
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,344
I was so sure that I was gonna be...

486
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,596
a great wife.

487
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,973
Anyway, this is where it gets stupid,

488
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,518
- so brace yourself for this part.
- Okay.

489
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,896
I put on the veil
and then tried to put on the dress,

490
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,941
but it doesn't fit,
but we're not talking about that,

491
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,192
uh...

492
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,736
just so I could reconnect
to that person, and then...

493
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,364
I put on this song because...

494
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,869
Because you picked this song
for our wedding

495
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,746
and it always makes me dance.

496
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,626
So that's, uh, pretty much it.

497
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,336
Now you're up to speed.

498
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,589
And I'm also out of breath.

499
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:57,518
Well, like I said before,
you can't just wave a wand.

500
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,399
But that was pretty fucking close.

521
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,508
I wanna go back to yesterday,

522
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,469
when counsel asked you
about the other men.

523
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:42,266
I have to admit,
we were all a bit thrown by it.

524
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,934
- I was thrown.
- Hmm.

525
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:49,231
I mean, I'm clearly still struggling.

526
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,734
Are you getting professional help?

527
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,487
Yes. Yes, I am,
and I've stopped taking the Ambien.

528
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,697
And the other?

529
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:01,201
Are we dealing with some kind
of sexual addiction here?

530
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,121
No, there's no sexual addiction.

531
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,583
Mrs. Wright, something seems
to be going on here.

532
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,168
These encounters...

533
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,921
- Are you getting help for this?
- I will.

534
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,923
- You will?
- Yes.

535
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,216
Why haven't you?

536
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,512
I think I've been too ashamed.

537
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:22,639
To tell your therapist, even?

538
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,683
Especially my therapist.

539
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:25,809
Why is that?

540
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,187
Because she's worked so hard
on me, and...

541
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,482
I think I just...

542
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:37,071
I desperately wanted to see myself
through her eyes and see progress.

543
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:41,492
It seems like risky behavior.
How am I to trust that this will stop?

544
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:42,993
Because it will stop.

545
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,245
It will.

546
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,455
It has stopped.

547
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,960
All right, I have to be honest here.

548
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,089
It gives me pause.

549
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:58,467
I need you to explain to me,
as best you can,

550
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,386
what you think is going on here.

551
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,806
I wanted to be touched. I wanted it...

552
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,227
I wanted it to be uncomplicated,

553
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,563
and I wanted to be in control, so...

554
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:16,402
And as it was said yesterday,
um, the violence with Perry...

555
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:22,282
would sometimes lead to sex,
which would...

556
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,576
I mean, it's... It's just...

557
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,205
It's confusing, so...

558
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,041
I think that's...

559
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,210
And it... It sickens me.

560
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,047
And so that's why I was engaging
with the others, because I...

561
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:40,592
These other men, because I think
I wanted to be free of Perry,

562
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,886
and I wanna push him out.

563
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,681
- "Him" being your husband?
- Yes. Yes.

564
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,058
Were you maybe looking
to hurt yourself?

565
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:50,477
No, I really don't think
I was doing that.

566
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,604
I think I just wanted to push him out.

567
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,484
Well, I am all too familiar that...

568
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,946
many women stay with their abusers.

569
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,030
Mm-hm.

570
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,615
Tell me why you stayed.

571
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,831
Um, because...

572
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,131
I loved him, and I
thought... And... But I...

573
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,885
I just always thought
he would get better.

574
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,096
- But he didn't.
- No, he didn't.

575
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,476
And when I was happy,
I stayed because I was happy

576
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,355
and when I was depressed,
I stayed because I was depressed.

577
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,484
I mean, either way, I was afraid

578
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:42,154
if I left him of what he might do.
I was afraid how he would react.

579
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,531
I was afraid of being alone. I was...

580
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:46,950
So I stayed. I stayed to survive.

581
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,328
I stayed for my boys.

582
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,293
Yeah. I'm good.

583
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,713
Mr. Farber.

584
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:00,796
Thank you.

585
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,639
I dare to ask...

586
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,938
I'm right here, Mama.

587
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,733
Can you see me?

588
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,531
How you doing?

589
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,695
Well, it looks like it's time.

590
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,450
I have to confess something
that I'm not so proud of.

591
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,160
And as I was writing...

592
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,291
I realized I needed
to confess to you first.

593
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,254
So here it goes.

594
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,925
I resent you...

595
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,220
for the childhood I had.

596
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,514
I resent you for your impatience...

597
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,561
for being scared of doing my homework
without being yelled at...

598
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,482
for all the kitchen cabinet doors
you slammed...

599
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,736
for slapping me,

600
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,114
for all the bruises.

601
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,410
I resent you
for not feeling safe at home.

602
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,039
I resent you for being ashamed of me.

603
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,629
I resent you
for all the sex I started to have

604
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:04,712
when I was 13

605
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:07,299
to prove to myself that I could be loved.

606
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,932
I resent you for my wanting
to beat the shit out of everyone.

607
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:21,772
I resent you for making me feel
so fucking worthless

608
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,774
that I settled for a man that I don't...

609
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,741
But mainly...

610
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,078
I resent you...

611
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,581
for killing a man.

612
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,378
I killed Celeste's husband,

613
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,837
and he didn't slip.

614
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,340
I pushed him.

615
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,011
I snapped, and...

616
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,682
when I lunged at him,

617
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:59,059
I... I was pushing you.

618
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,358
And that push was a long time coming.

619
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,155
And I wanna forgive you.

620
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:33,135
There was an incident
where a little girl was being bullied,

621
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,928
bitten, choked.

622
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,430
The bully was your son.

623
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,476
My sons are good boys.

624
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,645
So given your struggles,
why not let them stay

625
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,939
with their grandmother while you heal?

626
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,649
I am their mother.

627
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,443
And they belong with me.

628
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,659
- Robert Johannsson.
- Yeah.

629
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,661
And this was for a model train?

630
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,122
A Lionel Union Pacific Car.

631
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,790
It's, uh, vintage.

632
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:07,502
Stated value is $2200.
Probably worth closer to 3000.

633
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:08,754
Duly noted.

634
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,006
Marshall Brickman.

635
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:13,800
No Marshall Brickman?

636
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,635
All right, Juliette Dubois.

637
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,391
And you're seeking severance
in the amount of $72,000?

638
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:24,060
Yes, sir.
I worked there for six years.

639
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:27,647
Okay.
And what is this "other" listed?

640
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,441
Hundred and sixty thousand dollars?

641
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,235
That's for other services rendered,

642
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,864
for which I was promised
to be taken care of.

643
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,991
And what other services?

644
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:42,037
Uh... Stress management.

645
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,164
Can you be more specific?

646
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,833
I just like to leave it at that if I could.

647
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,215
I still love you. You know that, right?

648
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,801
Shut the fuck up

649
00:43:55,884 --> 00:44:00,680
for the rest
of your fucked-up fucking life.

650
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:02,557
Do you hear me?

651
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:06,436
I don't wanna hear one fucking word

652
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,316
from your fucked-up
little fucking twerp mouth

653
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,109
on why you fucked up,

654
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:18,281
no matter what fucked-up excuse
you come up with.

655
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:21,785
You fucking... Fuck! Shit!

656
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,411
Fuckhead!

657
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,540
The fucking nanny?

658
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,258
All rise.

659
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,222
Be seated.

660
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,602
As I said, I find the psychiatric reports

661
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:49,729
and the custody evals a bit of a wash,

662
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:54,234
but I think I have a pretty good grasp
of what we're dealing with here.

663
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,028
And I'm prepared to enter my finding
at this time.

664
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,197
In the case...

665
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,118
- Mrs. Wright.
- I would like to call a witness.

666
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,414
I don't think a character witness
would carry much weight...

667
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,499
This is not a character witness.

668
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:13,336
You've been asked to decide
where my boys would be better off.

669
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,257
That puts in question
the petitioner's fitness as well.

670
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,134
I was examined. She should be too.

671
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,637
There has been no suggestion
that my client's parental capacity

672
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:25,390
- is up for review.
- I'm making that suggestion now.

673
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,225
I was fair game. So is she.

674
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:32,731
All right. We will schedule
the petitioner's testimony for Tuesday.

675
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:36,318
And with the court's permission,
I would like to question her myself.

676
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,195
I don't think that's wise.

677
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,531
I'm an attorney.
I have a current bar license.

678
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:43,658
I'm entitled to participate
in my own defense.

679
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,538
That may very well be true, but I
don't think it's in your best interest.

680
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:52,125
It's my fight, Your Honor.
I ask that you let me wage it.

681
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:55,253
Very well.

682
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:56,671
Tuesday at 1:00.

683
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,632
