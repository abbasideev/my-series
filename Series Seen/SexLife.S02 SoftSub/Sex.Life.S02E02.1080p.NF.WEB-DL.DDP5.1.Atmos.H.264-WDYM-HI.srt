After suffering emotional trauma,
we... crave stability and security.

65
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,087
And so we make choices that...
we believe will keep us safe.

66
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:20,134
And these choices are solutions
and they do work... for a while.

67
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:26,307
But, um... sometimes...
our choices can have unexpected...

68
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,853
even disastrous consequences.

00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,715

No, look, I'm...

348
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,445
I was honest with you

349
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,280
<i>about what a mess my life is,</i>

350
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:49,076
and things have...
They've just gotten worse.

351
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,287
- I know it's weird, but Brad and I...
<i>- It's not just that.</i>

352
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,081
My mother's in town.

353
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,918
And having her here

354
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,922
<i>has brought up a lot of stuff,
you know, not just about Brad,</i>

355
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,509
but about me, about the choices I've made.

356
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:10,055
I get it. I know all about evil moms
who make you question life choices.

357
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,139
Yeah.

whatever your part in it,</i>

359
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,521
that doesn't mean
you don't deserve to eventually move on.

360
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,399
- And at least try to find happiness.
- <i>I don't know.</i>

361
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,193
Maybe I'm not ready.

362
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,655
Maybe I'm just too broken.

363
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,738

365
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,369

Hi, baby! Oh...

368
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,379
- Oh!
- I missed you so much.

369
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,965
Oh, I missed you too.

370
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,807
What...? Francesca, hey.
What happened? Are you okay?

371
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,975
No, I'm not okay.

372
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,518
I'm fired.

373
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,854
What? That's impossible.

374
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,438
I have to go clear out my office,

375
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,524
they're sending up security
to escort me out.

376
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,901
No, no, no. Okay?

377
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,530
No. This can't happen. I won't let it.

378
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,575
Cooper, please.
I don't want to make this a thing.

379
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,242
It already is.

380
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,957
Hey!

381
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,209
Total bullshit move, Dave.

382
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,461
This is sexism straight up.

383
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,132
Francesca abused her power
as a senior executive.

384
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,926
It was the both of us, not just her.

385
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,470
She was your boss, Cooper.
She knew the rules.

386
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,014
So did I.

387
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:38,685
We can't have managers
who can't even manage themselves.

388
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,814
- She got a very generous package.
- No. No!

389
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,067
Don't fire her.

390
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,695
Fire me.

391
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,778
Cooper.

392
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,032
And if you won't fire me...

393
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,118
then I quit.

394
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,371
- Cooper, stop it. This is crazy.
- No. They're crazy.

395
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,876
This? This is real.

396
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,390
Do you want a snack?
Are you hungry, baby? No? You ate?

397
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,187
There he is. My big boy.

398
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,814
I have missed you so much!

399
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,775
- Hi, Grandma.
- Oh, honey.

400
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,110
You're still here.

401
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,072
You didn't think I would leave
without saying goodbye, did you?

402
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,740
A girl can dream.

403
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,823
Hi, Olga.

404
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,119
Hello, my sweet girl.

405
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,037
Mommy missed you.

406
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,208
Olga, perhaps you can take the children
upstairs for their bath.

407
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,585
I'd like to speak to my daughter. Alone.

408
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,839
I think we've said enough to each other
for another 25 years or so.

409
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:54,636
- Don't you think?
- Billie, please, I want to apologize.

410
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,974
I need you to understand...

411
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,270
I'm not the person that you think I am.

412
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,439
At least, I wasn't always.

413
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,868
Mm! Oh, my God.
I can't get over how amazing you were.

414
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,829
So commanding.

415
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,080
So forceful.

416
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,623
So hot.

417
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,918
Fuck those assholes.

418
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,338
Cooper, I don't even know
who you are right now.

419
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,799
Come on.

420
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,888
Oh, believe it or not, growing up...

421
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,225
I was a lot like you.

422
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,061
Interested in boys and sex...

423
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,816
at a time when we were all
supposed to be good girls.

424
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,901
Isn't that all the time? Even now?

425
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,696
You have no idea
what it was like back then.

426
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,948
What is that supposed to mean?

427
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:04,497
I got caught with one of those boys
that I was so crazy about.

428
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,581
A quarterback.

429
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,294
We snuck off after a game to his car,

430
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,504
thought nobody would see,

431
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,924
and my classmates branded me a slut.

432
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,636
And that never went away.

433
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,889
Not even at home.

434
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,184
My mother made sure of that.

435
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,522
Why didn't you ever tell me this?

436
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,694
Because you're not the only one
who felt shame.

437
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,284
I love you, Billie.

438
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,162
No matter what you think.

439
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,667
All I've ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

440
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,672
Then I need you to understand...

441
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,054
that trying to fix my marriage
with Cooper is not the way.

442
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,102
Right or wrong... Cooper is in my past.

443
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,646
And so is Brad.

444
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,527
And is this Majid your future?

445
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,989
I don't know. I...

446
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,412
I haven't... had the chance to find out.

447
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,872
Things are complicated.

448
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,333
Honestly, I'm scared.

449
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,255
But I wanna be happy. And I want my...

450
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,384
I want my kids to see me happy.

451
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,808
And if I can do that,
then maybe all of this will have been...

452
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,268
worth it.

453
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,607
Then go to him.

454
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,486
What?

455
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,364
You got a nanny
and a grandma in the house.

456
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,366
That's plenty of consistency.

457
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,203
Stop being afraid.

458
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,165

What else could even come close?

to Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis.

467
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,906
I got a taste of what it's like
to help people on a global scale and...

468
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,575
And I never looked back.

469
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,744

471

And you're still here.

479
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,026
What new book?

480
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:24,781
The one I just sold to Random House
for 500 grand.

481
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,618
I soft pitched them a follow-up
to <i>The Third Way.</i>

482
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,830
A follow-up?
I don't even know if there is one.

483
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,913
Oh, there is.

484

It's called <i>Unattached.</i>

486

Just saying.

488
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,347
- Everything all right?
- Perfect.

489
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,600
But I have to go.

490

- Thanks!

492
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,361
Now, all I need is an idea,

I'm sorry.

497
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,290
I'll walk you home.

- Hey, good to see you, man.

499
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,794
Hey, man.

500
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,421
- Next round's on me, okay?
- Thanks.

Need you, boss.
