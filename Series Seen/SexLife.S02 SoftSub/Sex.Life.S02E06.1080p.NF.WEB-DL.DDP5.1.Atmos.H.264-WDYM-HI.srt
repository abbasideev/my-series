00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,657
this is goodbye?

176
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,828
I guess so.

177
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,383
[Cooper] Hi, I'm Cooper.

178
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,552
I wouldn't exactly say
that I'm an alcoholic.

179
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,181
But I...
I have been 30 days without drinking.

180
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,849
[crowd chuckles]

181
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,398
This last year
has been the hardest year of my life.

182
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,031
I tried a lot of things
to deal with my pain.

183
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,911
Alcohol, drugs...

184
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,289
sex.

185
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,502
But the one thing that I didn't do
was talk about it.

186
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,755
And that's why coming here

187
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,676
and listening to everyone
be so honest, so...

188
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,056
So willing to look at themselves
and what they've done,

189
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:32,311
I really admire that because I've been
trying to do everything that I can

190
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,773
to avoid taking responsibility for...

191
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,108
For my part in, uh...

192
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,030
Uh...

193
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,116
In my marriage failing.

194
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,995
I used to be such a good guy.

195
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,043
- I haven't been a good guy lately.
- [door opens]

196
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,884
And a lot of people...

197
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,517
have spent a lot of time trying to help me
get back to the person that I was.

198
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,686
I wouldn't let them.

199
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,357
All I can do now is try and make it up.

200
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,822
Try and make amends, right?

201
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,450
Just keep moving forward.

202
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,037
- So...
- [crowd applauding]

203
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,171
Weird, right?

204
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,344
Never thought I'd be the guy giving weepy
confessionals to a room full of strangers.

205
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,388
Don't tell Mom.

206
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,683
- I sent her the video. Was that wrong?
- Bet you did.

207
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,729
Hey, I'm really proud of you.

208
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,439
Thank you.

209
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,776
For everything,
for keeping me out of jail.

210
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,781
- I mean, I probably deserve to go.
- No, you're here.

211
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,036
You paid your fine. You're doing
a boatload of community service.

212
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,165
And bonus, Piper and Bianca,
they agreed to settle the lawsuit.

213
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,708
You're kidding me.

214
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,628
Let's just say
you're not retiring any time soon.

215
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,547
But it's done, and they're okay?

216
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,008
It's enough, right?

217
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,470
It's time to put all this behind you,
focus on the future.

218
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:34,016
Yeah, because the future
seems so bright, huh?

219
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,310
It's a blank slate.

220
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,650
Well, that's the scary part.
What am I gonna fill it with?

221
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,446
Now that, I can't wait to see.

222
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,534
[announcer]
<i>It's opening day in the Big Apple.</i>

223
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,036
<i>A great day here in the Bronx</i>

224
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,791
<i>and a great day for Major League Baseball.
The Yanks will be squaring off...</i>

225
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,501
- Hi.
- [Hudson] Majid.

226
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,337
Who's more excited about this game?
You or me?

227
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,756
- Me.
- [laughs] Hi.

228
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,384
Oh, he wants a Mickey Mantle bat.
Do not get it for him.

229
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,052
I got something better.

230
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,220
[gasps]

231
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,389
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

232
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,766
Yes. Come on, come here. Oh.

233
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,725
Arms up.

234
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,730
[Majid] Uh... Whoops.

235
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,733
- Sorry.
- It's no big deal.

236
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,611
We'll get a smaller one at the game.
Let's go.

237
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,196
I'll go get the car seat.

238
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,489
- Right.
- [Billie] Yes.

239
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,201
- You can't duct tape him to the back.
- I'm gonna get this. I promise.

240
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,537
- Let's do it. Let's go.
- Come on.

241
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
Come on.

242
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,762
[Devon]
Dude, wipe that smile off your face.

243
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,756
- I'm still the reigning pickleball champ.
- Okay, but not today you're not.

244
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,634
You only beat my ass there
'cause I'm a month out of surgery.

245
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,136
Wait till I get my lob back.

246
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,221
I'm glad to know
that's your biggest problem.

247
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,307
Seriously, I had a huge realization
in that crash.

248
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:03,772
- What have we been doing with our lives?
- Right? I mean, I'm turning it all around.

249
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:09,361
Like, blank slate.
In fact, I'm thinking about calling Emily.

250
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,196
- Wait, what?
- Mm-hm.

251
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
Emily, your ex?

252
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,492
Emily stick-in-the-mud,
sweater set, vanilla latte Emily?

253
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,578
Same Emily you tried to hook me up with.

254
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,081
To make you feel better.
She had puppy dog eyes.

255
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,917
- She thought you could do no wrong.
- Yeah, exactly.

256
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,421
Maybe that's what I need now.
I don't know.

257
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,009
Maybe she was the right woman
for me all along.

258
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,011
You are a fucking snooze-o-rama.

259
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:39,433
Dude, what I realized is that I've been
wasting my life, at least my sex life.

260
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,188
- I have so many more sexual voyages ahead.
- Okay, Dev. I...

261
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,107
I didn't wanna ask,

262
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:51,278
but I thought that after the accident
that everything down there, it...

263
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,322
It might have been, uh...

264
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,867
impacted?

265
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,955
Are you kidding? They reconstructed it.
I actually gained an inch.

266
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,416
Really? Okay.

267
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,170
Look, one of the tendons was cut.
But that's a good thing.

268
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,173
- It let some of my inner penis fall out.
- I'm sorry. Inner penis?

269
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,592
We all got one, dude.
You can't tell when it's soft.

270
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,220
- Let me fire it up for you.
- What the hell are you doing?

271
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,098
Doc put a pump in.
I need a little help after the remodel.

272
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,225
- I... I don't wanna see this.
- I wanna see it.

273
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,477
Yeah, everything's fully automated.

274
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,438
I have a stylish new curve, which is cool.
Chicks dig it, right?

275
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,690
Makes it easier to hit the G-spot.

276
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,111
If you actually believe
the G-spot's a thing, am I right?

277
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,655
Who'd have thought
that Piper biting my penis off

278
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:39,701
would give me a whole new lease on life?
My man, I am just getting started.

279
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,417
- How you doing, champ?
- I'm hungry. Can I have a snack?

280
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,794
Uh...

281
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,715
- I have a mint.
- You don't have any snacks?

282
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,635
- [cell phone ringing]
- One sec. Hey, Alonso. What's up?

283
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,263
- [Alonso] <i>Eva quit.</i>
- What? Shit!

284
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,266
- You owe me a dollar.
- <i>You gotta come in.</i>

285
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,351
Um, Christophe's gotta take over.

286
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,728
<i>- On a Saturday dinner rush?</i>
- It's not a good night.

287
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,981
<i>It's not a good night for any of us.</i>

288
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,736
- Gotta make a quick pit stop, buddy.
- Okay.

289
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,198
How would you like
another Nutella lava melt, huh?

290
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,116
[gasps]

291
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,492
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

292
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,952
That's what I'm talking about.

293
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,969
What's going on?

294
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,224
You can't be nervous.

295
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,560
You're a superstar.

296
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
It's not that.

297
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,938
It's this.

298
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,195
His plane leaves
in four hours and 35 minutes.

299
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,155
Not that I set a timer on my phone.

300
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,868
- Oh, honey.
- It's for the best.

301
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,995
He can move on and so will I.

302
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,415
I can focus on my work,
maybe find a new Kam.

303
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,709
- Just like you found Majid.
- Or...

304
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,839
Or what? I'm gonna go live in Singapore?

305
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,548
You could.

306
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,013
Sash, this isn't about
the logistics of work and life.

307
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,598
This is about power.

308
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,771
Who sacrifices for whom,
and someone always has to give first.

309
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,232
You are the one who gave up your power,

310
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,986
sacrificed a huge part of yourself
for a man with disastrous results.

311
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,864
- You're telling me to do the same thing?
- It's not the same.

312
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,451
Cooper and I weren't right for each other,
but I still believe in marriage.

313
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,997
I still believe in that kind
of partnership, and honestly...

314
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,086
if I could go back
and do it all over again...

315
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,883
I might say yes to Brad's proposal
on my driveway.

316
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,262
That kind of love comes...

317
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,847
once in a lifetime.

318
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,644
Now, it's too late for us.

319
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,481
But it's not too late for you and Kam.

320
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,946
Honey, you have a second chance.
Are you sure you don't wanna take it?

321
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,741
Sasha, my star.

322
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,867
Gran.

323
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,287
- Hi, Billie.
- Hi there, Roz.

324
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,872
- I'm so glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?

325
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,709
This is your manifest destiny.

326
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,839
It is my honor to see you exactly
where you're supposed to be.

327
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:51,810
I am the master of my fate,
the captain of my soul.

328
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:59,192
For decades,
those were words reserved for men alone.

329
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:04,614
Women were expected to support,
to bend, to comply,

330
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:10,078
to derive their power
from the men to whom they were attached.

331
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:16,084
But this is a new era for women,

332
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,881
for anyone
who wants to answer only to themselves

333
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:27,179
and stand unattached
in the glory and power of doing...

334
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,890
what you want...

335
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,475
when you want...

336
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,521
with whomever you want.

337
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,782
Come with me.

338
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,453
Um... [clears throat] Sorry.

339
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,593
When you follow your own path,
find your own way,

340
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:10,472
you never have to ask yourself
what life could have been...

341
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:18,271
because you can make it
exactly what you want it to be.

342
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,484
Thank you.

343
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,319
[crowd applauding and cheering]

344
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,421
Great.

345
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,968
Thank you so much for coming.

346
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,722
I'm supposed to get home to Ellary,
but are you okay?

347
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,183
- We did it.
- Roz.

348
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,935
Yes, it is all about me.

349
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,937
Well, call me.

350
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,356
From wherever you end up.

351
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,110
Have a good night.

352
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,071
Oh, it's a shame about Billie.

353
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,824
- Gran.
- She's back at school.

354
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:15,036
You said. I know.
But she wasted so much time.

355
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,540
You stayed the course.
Didn't let yourself get distracted.

356
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,586
Now you've got everything
you could ever want.

357
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,214
Except I'm alone.

358
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,850
Gran, I will always be grateful to you

359
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,146
for insisting I not throw away my dreams
all those years ago.

360
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,818
I don't think any of this would exist if
I had run off to California when I was 22.

361
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,320
Damn straight.

362
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,406
But I'm not 22 anymore.

363
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,783
And...

364
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,748
I'm not sure this is
how I wanna spend the rest of my life.

365
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,626
Why not?

366
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758
Kam is back.

367
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,967
Oh, God.

368
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:15,055
He still loves me.
He wants me to move to Singapore with him.

369
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,431
[laughing]

370
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,934
Of course he does.

371
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,311
So after all this time,

372
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,563
you're just gonna
turn into one of those girls

373
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,192
- who chucks it all to run after some man?
- Not some man.

374
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,071
Kam.

375
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,615
And maybe I am that girl, okay?

376
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,576
Who gets swept away to Rome

377
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,330
and who says yes
to a crazy proposal at the MET and...

378
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,417
And who wants to follow the love
of her life to a tiny island in Asia

379
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,045
where the zucchinis cost
15 fucking dollars.

380
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,969
I've got the success now.

381
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,640
I want the man too.

382
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,686
I wanna at least try to have it all,

383
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,899
so I don't spend the rest of my life
wondering, "What if?"

384
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,152
You just stood on that stage.

385
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:17,993
Your entire essence is convincing women
to live life on their own terms.

386
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,912
Now, you're gonna go and do the opposite?

387
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,540
Maybe these are my terms.

388
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,004
Hey, buddy.

389
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,673
Only a few more minutes.

390
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,384
I checked the score,
Yanks are up three to nothing.

391
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,303
You need anything? More hot chocolate?

392
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,595
- Okay.
- Okay.

393
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,642
Majid, you gotta take this.
I got a lead on a replacement chef.

394
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,726
Oh.

395
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,657
[dramatic music playing]

396
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,215
[woman] Great.

397
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,969
We got five grilled prawns coming up.
Don't step back. I'm behind.

398
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,054
[woman] We gotta go!

399
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,306
- Flash the tagine for me!
- Excuse me?

400
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,975
What are you doing here?
You gotta go, man.

401
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,687
- Can I have more hot chocolate?
- What?

402
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,774
- Shit, shit!
- I'll get the extinguisher!

403
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,318
It's spreading! Oh, my God!

404
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,612
- Call 911!
- Hudson, why are you in the kitchen?

405
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,781
You're not allowed in here!
What are you doing?

406
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,703
Stay right here! Do not move!

407
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,226
[cell phone ringing]

408
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,231
Hey, how's the game?
Are the Yankees winning?

409
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,025
[Majid] <i>Billie, I'm so sorry.</i>

410
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,777
What happened?

411
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,323
[Cooper] His name's Hudson Connelly.
He's 6 years old.

412
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,407
- He's probably three feet tall.
- [Billie] Cooper.

413
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,327
- Cooper.
- Hey.

414
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:30,917
[sobbing] Oh, my God. I'm so, so sorry.

415
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,920
- [Cooper] Stop.
- I'm so sorry.

416
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:38,091
- No, no, stop. It's not your fault.
- It's my fault.

417
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,302
I know, I'm the one who's sorry.

418
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,012
Why did you even bring Hudson here?

419
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,433
- You were supposed to be at the game.
- It was supposed to be a quick stop.

420
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,809
And you didn't think to call

421
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,854
or to even text me to let me know
where you were taking my son?

422
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,440
Billie, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find him.

423
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,024
I got my staff out there looking.

424
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,360
Well, I'm not just
gonna sit around here and wait.

425
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,030
Okay, I'll head east. You go west. Yeah?

426
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,282
- Yeah.
- Okay.

427
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,118
- I'll come with you.
- No. Don't.

428
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,578
Billie.

429
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,377
- What are you doing here?
- Alonso called all the investors.

430
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,630
- How bad is it?
- I don't know, but Hudson was here,

431
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,174
and now he's missing.

432
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,259
- He ran away.
- What?

433
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,887
- I need to go find him.
- I'm coming with you.

434
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,681
I have no idea
where he would even think to go.

435
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,392
- Does he have a favorite spot?
- He doesn't know the city.

436
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,853
He's only been
to Majid's restaurant once before.

437
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,398
Um, the day that
we ran into you in the park.

438
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,818
He loved that bubble guy, remember?
The park's just up here.

439
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,529
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, come on, come on.

440
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,948
Mick is in a very important meeting
right now.

441
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,456
Nice brotox, buddy.

442
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,582
Ow, ow.

443
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,544
What's the matter with you?
My maxillofacials are very sensitive.

444
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,507
- This is who I was, but it's not who I am.
- The fuck is that supposed to mean?

445
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,468
I'm not gonna live a lie anymore
and I'm not gonna hide.

446
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,136
Do I look like I have a vagina?

447
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,931
Save it for <i>The View</i>.
You got a book tour coming up.

448
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,183
I'll do the tour for <i>Unattached,</i>

449
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:15,104
but only as a promotion
for my next book, <i>Sustained By Love.</i>

450
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,191
So schmaltzy.
<i>Shitstained By Love</i> is more like it.

451
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:22,987
And last, I checked, your 10%
was paying me to set your brand strategy.

452
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,198
Who are you to start barking orders?

453
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:29,327
I'm Sasha fucking Snow.
And I've got a plane to catch.

454
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,669
Hey, have you seen a little boy
about this tall, blond?

455
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,920
- No?
- No?

456
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,555
I don't see anyone.

457
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,932
Hey. Hey, Billie. Billie, look at me.

458
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,310
We're gonna find him, all right?
Here or somewhere else.

459
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,775
[Billie] Hudson?

460
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,905
Hudson!

461
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,074
- Mommy?
- [Billie] Huds.

462
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,661
Hi, Mama.

463
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,913
I was so worried about you.

464
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,084
There was a fire.

465
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,045
And Majid yelled at me,
and he owes me a dollar.

466
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,799
I came to see bubble man,
but bubble man's not here.

467
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,509
Yes, I know, baby. I know.

468
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,846
That was just a special treat,
not every day.

469
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,724
Those bubbles were great though, eh, mate?

470
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,144
- You're that guy. Mommy's friend.
- [Billie] Yeah.

471
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,396
Mommy's friend.

472
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,945
Hey, you can never run away again.

473
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,906
Okay? Ever.

474
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,990
I'm sorry.

475
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,242
That's okay.

476
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,787
You know, I know what it's like to be
a scared little kid in New York City.

477
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,958
So don't worry. Okay?

478
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,177
[all laughing]

479
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,680
- [Hudson] You said you wanted my sneakers.
- [Brad] Oh, I do.

480
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,351
- You said they were cool kicks.
- Wasn't that funny?

481
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,938
The way you were looking at him,
I was like...

482
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,273
- Oh!
- Daddy.

483
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,444
Oh, buddy, hey.

484
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,071
You had us worried sick.

485
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,997
Thank you for your help.

486
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,832
I didn't do anything.

487
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,167
Oh, yes, you did.

488
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,420
It was Brad's idea where to find Hudson.

489
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,675
He remembered this park
that we'd all been at last month

490
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:53,346
- where we ran into each other.
- Well, I'm very grateful.

491
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,183
We both are.

492
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,651
Well, I should get inside
and check out the damage.

493
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,193
Check on Majid.

494
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,925
I'll see you around, little man.

495
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,844
Oh, yeah. Nice.

496
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,139
Can you come home with us, Daddy?

497
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,518
- It's fine with me.
- Yeah?

498
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,022
Yeah, we can...
We can set up the guest room again.

499
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,316
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Okay, baby?

500
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,318
- Okay?
- Hey, that would be great.

501
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,823
But, hey, listen to me.
I'm gonna meet you there. Okay?

502
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,658
I just need to do one thing first.

503
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,118
- All right?
- Okay. Yeah.

504
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,416
[dramatic music playing]

505
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,436
Kam, wait.

506
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,816
- Sasha, what are you doing here?
- I'm coming with you.

507
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,862
I don't have anything.
I ran here straight from my book launch.

508
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,948
Well, that and telling Mick

in front of all of you. [chuckles]

all the things that you have to offer,

00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,271
I'm so happy for you.

680
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,065
And Emily.

681
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,816
Thank you.

682
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,652
[Billie chuckles]

683
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,196
So...

684
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,115
I gotta ask...

685
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,120
Are you happy?

686
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,165
Uh...

687
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,501
I am. Yeah.

688
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:41,548
I mean, this isn't the fairy tale
I imagined for myself, but you know,

689
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:48,055
I've got friends, work, kids I adore,
a pretty cute and responsible co-parent.

690
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,267
It's a fairy tale of its own kind.

691
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:06,782
<i>In the end, all of us will look back
on our lives and say one of two things:</i>

692
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,579
<i>"I wish I had," or "I'm glad I did."</i>

693
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,545
<i>We've had so many amazing
"I'm glad I did" moments...</i>

694
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,591
<i>even in those teary, soul-crushing days.</i>

695
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:31,014
<i>I'm glad I had those moments too,
because I had them with you.</i>

696
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,771
You're that rare person
who has no "I wish I hads,"

697
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,358
who fearlessly says yes,

698
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,571
even now to a man who is the definition...

699
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,615
of "I'm glad I did."

700
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:55,747
You are proud,
passionate, open to the world.

701
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,211
And most of all, my best friend.

702
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,549
So, Kam, enjoy her.

703
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,758
[laughter]

704
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,555
But don't forget, it's you and me.

705
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,265
Always.

706
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,060
Always.

707
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,145
To Sasha and Kam.

708
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,397
- [all] To Sasha and Kam.
- [man 1] Cheers.

709
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,567
- [man 2] Yeah.
- [man 1] Congratulations, Sasha and Kam.

710
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,576
[Billie] <i>You and me.</i>

711
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:34,785
<i>Always.</i>

712
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,270
That was beautiful, Billie.

713
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,190
You've always had a way with words.

714
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,983
What are you doing here?

715
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,780
I asked Sasha if I could
come and surprise you,

716
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,323
sweep you off your feet.

717
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,994
She made me promise
to wait until after the cake, but...

718
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:17,953
[chuckles]

719
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,715
Where's Gigi?

720
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,424
She left.

721
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:32,969
A while ago, actually.

722
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,475
She's with someone else now,
who didn't just lose his company.

723
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,315
We both knew in our hearts that I could...

724
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,652
I could never be hers completely.

725
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,074
Because I've never stopped being yours.

726
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,537
It's you, B.

727
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,290
It's always been you.

728
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,795
Please tell me this is real.

729
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,172
[chuckles] It's real.

730
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,007
We are real.

731
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,055
We are undeniable.

732
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,099
You know that.

733
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,606
- I think I'm gonna faint. I...
- Here.
