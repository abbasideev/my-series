Ed Fredlich
promoted me to Junior VP at 24,

making me the youngest exec
to lead my own team at the time.

Oh, you knew Ed Fredlich?

158

but that experience
has given me new perspective,

especially on how to appeal
to the burgeoning mommy market.

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,428
And considering 80% of your clients
cater to those consumers,

170
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,806

174
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,702
The landscape's changed
quite significantly since you worked here.

175
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,790
No one watches commercials.
It's all about Twitch and Clubhouse.

176
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,917
I pick things up very quickly.

177
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm sure you do.

178
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,881
Thank you so much for coming in.
Let me give this a thought.

179
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,262
- Would you like a list of my references?
- That's not necessary.

180
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,557
It was really nice meeting you.
A real history lesson.

so many vibrators in my life.

Can I have a few words?

186
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,165
Uh, yeah, of course!

187
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,334
Go on now, give me your coat.

188
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:39,133
I'm here with Sasha Snow, the mastermind
behind today's uber-empowering event,

189
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,594
Independent Woman 4 Life.

190
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,387
You must be thrilled by the turnout.

191
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,764
Thank you, Sangita. We are.

192
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,602
Especially because
20% of today's proceeds will go towards

193
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,855
micro-financing female entrepreneurs
in developing countries,

194
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,275
so we're hoping to sell a lot of T-shirts.

195
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,737
Fabulous! But if you don't mind,
I'd like to talk about you.

196
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,698
Oh, honey, I never mind.

197
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,241
What do you wanna know?

198
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,411
Three months ago,
you were a best-selling author,

199
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,371
but still relatively unknown.

200
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,582
Now you're practically a household name,

201
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,169
leading the charge
for smart young women everywhere.

202
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,962
What's your secret?

203
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,674
- Well, I have a really great agent.
- Of course.

204
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,429
But also...

205
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,974
I have a really great boyfriend.

206
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,144
You have a boyfriend?

207
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,565
Can you tell our viewers anything
about this lucky mystery man?

208
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,527
I'll do you one better. Kam.

209
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,153
- Oh, no, no.
- [Sasha] Come here.

210
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,198
- Come on, don't be shy.
- [Kam] Okay, all right.

211
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,117
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,578
This is Dr. Kamani Evans.

213
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,289
He provides medical disaster relief
all over the world

214
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,000
through his non-profit First Do No Harm.

215
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,211
So nice to meet you.

216
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,088
The pleasure's all mine.

217
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,217
A charming doctor that looks like that?
Hell of a secret weapon.

218
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,927
What does this mean for the future?

219
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,430
Will upcoming books
be written by Sasha Evans?

220
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,268
Girl, please.

221
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,438
If anything, he'll be treating patients
as Dr. Kamani Snow.

222
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:22,403
So tell me, are you able
to be unapologetically sexual,

223
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,780
as you call it in the book,
with Dr. Kamani?

224
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,490
Oh, absolutely.

225
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,077
You know, Kam was actually my first.

226
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,663
Talk about coming full circle.

227
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:37,167
Oh, I got your full circle.
This man knows how to work my situation.

228
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,421
Now, there's a visual
I'll be taking to bed tonight.

229
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,049
Then take this. He does this thing,
it's called the butter churner.

230
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,846
- He lifts my legs, stands in front of me...
- Okay, I think that's enough.

231
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,347
Tell me more!

232
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:55,603
No, seriously, I'm telling you,
the butter churner will change your life.

233
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,479
I'll do a post about it. Check for it.

234
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,566
Okay, maybe we should talk more
about microfinancing. Anybody?

235
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,319
You two are so adorable.
Thank you so much!

236
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,486
Thank you.

237
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,200
Merry Christmas!
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

238
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,162
So you won't even meet me indoors now?

239
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,874
Hmm. Oh, I don't know.

240
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,877
Just feels safer to have witnesses.

241
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,630
You quit Blue Sky without even telling me.

242
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,884
Whoops. Sorry, Mom. Guess I forgot
to have my permission slip signed.

243
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,638
Oh, Jesus, Cooper.
And now you're back with the evil empire?

244
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,349
Whatever happened
to working for principles?

245
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,267
You called me to talk about morality?

246
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,437
If that's the case,
it will be a short conversation.

247
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,898
Okay, all right.
I called to talk about Francesca.

248
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,110
- Are you two dating now?
- I don't think that's your business.

249
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,238
It is when you're
introducing her to our kids.

250
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,659
I assumed we would
discuss something like that first.

251
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,495
Well, you assumed wrong again.

252
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:01,752
Cooper, I have been trying so hard
to do things the right way

253
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,587
for the sake of our kids.

254
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,631
Then you have nothing to worry about.

255
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,426
Francesca's amazing
with Hudson and Ellary.

256
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,305
Does she spend the night
when she visits the house?

257
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,059
No. But I do spend the night
at her place when I'm in the city.

258
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,312
You told the lawyers
you were staying with your brother.

259
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,273
Please. As if this is any different
from your arrangement.

260
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,902
An empty apartment, which,
let's be honest, is just a PO box,

261
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,904
while you shack up with Brad.

262
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,367
Cooper, no. Brad and I are not together.

263
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,577
Oh, no. No, of course not.

264
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,539
No, he's having a baby with someone else.

265
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,874
We've both moved on.

266
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,841
Oh, Cooper.
I told you this was never about Brad.

267
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,677
Which means...

268
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,100
that this is about me.

269
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,606
Got it.

270
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,276
Cooper, wait.

271
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:15,826
You should have seen him, Sash.
It was like his whole world split open.

272
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,580
And I tried telling him all along
that this wasn't about Brad,

273
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,331
but he wouldn't listen.

274
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,959
He was just so angry.

275
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:31,258
But today I saw how much pain there was
underneath all that anger.

276
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,096
I'm worried about him, Sash.

277
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,766
Cooper's a rich, handsome white guy
in Manhattan, okay?

278
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,311
- He's gonna be fine.
- I'm not so sure he is.

279
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,563
It's not your sink, not your dishes.

280
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,151
- Cooper's not your husband anymore.
- We were together for nine years, Sasha.

281
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,778
He's the father of my children.

282
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:55,115
And he will continue
to be best dad ever to those kids.

283
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,786
But for you, he's in the past.

284
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,249
Majid is your future, and he is amazing.

285
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:09,421
I mean, not Kam amazing,
but still pretty fucking great.

286
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,673
- Pretty fucking great. Yeah.
- [laughs]

287
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,051

Trina.

289
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,153
- Cooper.
- Hey. What are you doing in the city, huh?

290
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,030
Big shopping day?

291
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,950
More like retail therapy.

292
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,870
Ugh. Sounds like you had
as crappy a day as I did.

293
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,416
I actually had a meeting
about getting my old job back.

294
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,669
Oh, no kidding? How'd that go?

295
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,629
When it was over, I ran to Bergdorf's

296
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,173
and dropped four grand
on a studded McQueen knuckle clutch,

297
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,592
so super practical.

298
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,806
All they want are 20-something influencers
with mega followers.

299
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,725
- Ugh. What a world, huh?
- Yeah.

300
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,104
Do you have a Twitch?

301
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,608
Do I...? No.

302
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,571
Does it look like I do? Because my eye
will flutter sometimes when I'm tired.

303
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,490
- It's a streaming platform.
- Oh, God.

304
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,951
At least I'm not the last person
to hear about it.

305
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,290
Well, this is me.

306
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,795
Please don't say anything to Devon.

307
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,798
I didn't even tell him
I was going for the interview.

308
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,342
I'm invisible enough at home.

309
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,720
I don't wanna give him
more excuses to dismiss me.

310
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,471
No, no, no, of course not.

311
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,684
But I think it's great
you're putting yourself out there.

312
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,688
They'd be lucky to have you.

313
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,275
I remember when we first met,

314
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,944
you were absolutely crushing it
in the ad world.

315
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,572
I'm glad someone remembers that person.

316
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,370
Well, get home safe, okay?

317
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,165
Cooper.

318
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,630
Do you ever think about that night?

319
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,757
At the party.

320
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,185
Yeah. I think about it all the time.

321
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,268
Me too.

322
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,820
- What time do your kids go to bed?
- Nine o'clock. Why?

323
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,366
Think maybe you could sneak out
without getting noticed?

00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,158
[Cooper chuckles]

343
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,787
How would you like to
take the night off tonight?

344
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,916
What are you talking about? No, I'm fine.

345
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,961
Oh, please.
You have been working non-stop lately,

346
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,173
and you deserve this,
so here, I insist, all right?

347
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:26,011
I want you to go get yourself
a nice dinner, go see a movie.

348
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,558
I suppose I could go
and see my sister's new condo.

349
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,268
She's been asking me to stay over.

350
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:38,065
Yeah, I think that's a fantastic idea,
so I'm gonna just take that, all right?

351
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,609
And why don't you go get ready?

352
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,828
All right, kiddos, who's ready for PJs?

353
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,873
Ells, yes? Hudson, yeah? Huh?

354
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,341
- Billie? Hey. Look what I have.
- Oh.

355
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,305
Who was that woman?

356
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,388
What woman?

357
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,685
The Kim Cattrall look-a-like
that was nuzzled up to your neck,

358
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,479
trying to, what, guess your cologne?

359
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,940
That's just Crystal.
She's one of our investors.

360
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,067
She seemed pretty invested in you.

361
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,278
She's just tipsy.
She acts that way with everyone.

362
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,115
Besides, I'm in the restaurant business.

363
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,535
Pretending to flirt with the ladies
is part of the gig.

364
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,622
Sorry to interrupt.
Mind if I steal Billie for a sec?

365
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,918
- You owe me a dance later. Okay?
- Okay, all right.

366
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,130
What's going on?

367
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,549
I wanted to give you a heads up.

368
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,345
I just saw Brad and Gigi, and they are...

369
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,600
[inaudible dialogue]

370
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,602
...married.

371
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,899
<i>♪ We'll be happier ♪</i>

372
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,778
<i>♪ Than we have... ♪</i>

373
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,827
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Do you wanna get out of here?

374
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,997
I don't get it. I thought I'd be fine.

375
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,666
I am in love with Majid.

376
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:23,253
I mean, I haven't even thought
about Brad in months, but...

377
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,214
He's married?

378
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,674
I know.

379
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,012
I keep trying to do what you say
and live in the future,

380
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,890
but the past just keeps
kicking me in the ass.

381
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,726
- They're headed this way.
- Okay.

382
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,811
- You want me to stay?
- I'm fine. It's okay.

383
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,813
I've got my big girl panties on.
It's okay.

384
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,648
- I'll be there if you need me.
- Okay.

385
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,732
You got this.

386
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,986
- Billie, hi! It's so good to see you.
- Hi.

387
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,572
- You remember Gigi?
- Yes, of course.

388
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,033
And I just heard the news. Congrats.

389
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,116
Thank you.

390
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,828
It was the best weekend I've ever had.

391
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,914
We snuck away to Playa del Carmen.

392
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,041
It was very intimate, family only.

393
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:05,670
Well, it was supposed to be until he flew
my best friends out to surprise me.

394
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,214
But the biggest surprise of all,

395
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:11,092
he got Enrique Iglesias
to serenade us on our first dance.

396
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,220
- How amazing is that?
- Enrique? Wow!

397
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,723
He was in Cancun on vacation
with his family, anyway, so...

398
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,516
Brad's so modest.

399
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
He really pulled out all the stops.

400
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,896
The only thing you didn't do
was get a haircut.

401
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,023
- Oh.
- But he did shave.

402
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,652
Oh, my gosh. Is that Natalia?

403
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,988
Would you excuse me? I haven't seen her
since we were Angels together.

404
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,907
We walked the show in Shanghai.

405
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,075
Excuse me.

406
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,079
Angels, as in...?

407
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,997
Victoria's Secret, yeah.

408
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,250
[chuckles] So that's...

409
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,002
your wife.

410
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,841
Yeah. I thought about reaching out
to let you know, but...

411
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,385
Oh, why would you?

412
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,390
This is a good thing, you know. Um...

413
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,057
For you.

414
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,811
For your baby.

415
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,653
I'm so sorry, Billie.

416
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,824
For what?

417
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,242
Picking her?

418
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,423
- Billie, I...
- No, don't. Don't.

419
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,553
I can't.

420
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,490
[Brad] We can have the life
we always should have had.

421
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,992
It's not too late.

422
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,786
I'm telling you, B. I've got you.

423
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,288
This can be real.

424
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,171
Billie. Hi.

425
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,965
I swear I have to pee every 30 minutes.

426
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,010
This baby is using my bladder
as a punching bag.

427
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,347
Yes, I... I remember those days. Yeah.

428
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,267
I'm glad I ran into you.
I was hoping we'd get the chance to talk.

429
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,727
About what?

430
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,396
None of my other friends have kids yet,

431
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,357
and I have been dying to get some advice

432
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,525
from someone
who's been through it all before.

433
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,778
Brad says you're an amazing mother.

434
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,155
- He told you that?
- He did.

435
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,325
Anyway, sorry to just
put it all out there,

436
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,785
but did you breastfeed?

437
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,830
Yes. Yes, I did. I did. I, um...

438
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,583
I breastfed both of my kids.

439
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,127
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

440
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,589
See, I really want to,
but my mom says it ruins your boobs

441
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,050
and that pump thing looks frightening.

442
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,845
Well, I mean,
you get used to it, you know.

443
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,641
Besides, if you want a night off,
let alone to go back to work,

444
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,603
then that thing is gonna become...
your breast friend.

445
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,686
[Gigi laughs]

446
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,438
Good to know.

447
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,192
Yeah. Brad is set on nursing.

448
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,987
- He's reading this book on the benefits...
- Of breastfeeding?

449
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,949
I know, right?
He's been reading all the parenting books.

450
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,285
Brad! Who would have thought? [laughs]

451
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,579
He wants to do this thing
called the family bed.

452
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,998
Yeah, yeah.

453
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,835
- Yeah, where he wants our son to sleep...
- Oh, um...

454
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,546
It's a boy?

455
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,798
Brad's ecstatic.

456
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,510
He said he didn't care either way,
but I know he wanted a son.

457
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,763
Anyway, he wants us
to all sleep in the big bed

458
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,558
to maximize skin-to-skin contact,
which is so sweet, really,

459
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,602
but I've just heard it's so important
to get the baby in his crib

460
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,939
as early as possible if there's any hope
of having a post-baby sex life.

461
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,733
You know what? Just stop. Um...

462
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,946
Honestly, we could debate this forever,
but I'll just tell you this,

463
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,241
co-sleeping, at least at first,
makes nighttime feedings easier,

464
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,828
but then eventually,
you'll want to get the baby into...

465
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:12,083
his own crib, because you'll want
that time for yourself...

466
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,420
and for your husband.

467
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,798
- Billie, wait.
- I'm sorry, I just, uh...

468
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,634
I need to go find Majid.

469
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,266
[knocking on door]

470
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,564
You came.

471
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,734
Well, not yet.

472
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,153
But hopefully, very soon.

473
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,082
Can I get you a glass of wine, or...?

474
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,542
Um...

475
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,044
Okay, then.

476
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,108
- [moaning]
- Shh.

477
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,777
Sorry.

478
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,118
Hey. Come with me.

479
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,201
Okay.

480
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,170
That's Billie's?

481
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,763
Billie's not here.

482
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,849
We are.

483
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,278
Mm.

484
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,989
Now that is an outfit.

485
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,742
Did you pick that up at Bergdorf's too?

486
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,122
Wait till you see what else
I've got in store for you.

487
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,085
This is your lucky night, Cooper Connelly.

488
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:11,012
- [chuckles]
- You've been a very naughty boy.

489
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,264
- I have been, haven't I?
- Mm.

490
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,100
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

491
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,321
Is this what you want?

492
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,989
Yes.

493
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,992
Beg me.

494
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,536
Oh...

495
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:41,000
Please, please, please.

496
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,377
- [Hudson] Daddy?
- [gasps]

497
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,880
Hudson, get out of here!

498
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Shit!

499
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,557
<i>♪ You're not leaving here tonight ♪</i>

500
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,227
<i>♪ We're tucked in safe and tight ♪</i>

501
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,105
<i>♪ Our fire has a little bit of life... ♪</i>

502
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,773
Hey. I'm so sorry.

503
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,192
Have you guys seen Majid?
I can't find him anywhere.

504
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,112
Are you okay? How'd it go with Brad?

505
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,577
- I can't even think about it.
- [Sasha] Uh-oh.

506
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:15,034
Do I need to kick some Aussie ass?
Slash some motorcycle tires?

507
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,911
It was fucking awful.

508
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,580
- I'll get us drinks.
- Thank you.

509
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,795
He said he was sorry,
which was humiliating.

510
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,590
And then his wife cornered me
with questions about motherhood,

511
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,759
like I'm the freaking La Leche League.

512
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,137
- I could not hate her more.
- No.

513
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,222
That's the worst part.

514
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,349
She's so nice.

515
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,309
She's way too nice to be friends with us.

516
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,438
And, apparently,
Brad has become super dad,

517
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,482
doing all the things we were
supposed to do when we were together,

518
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,360
as if I was the trial run,
then he got it all right with her.

519
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,280
I just really need
to find my fucking boyfriend.

520
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,115
Okay, we will find him.

521
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,284
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

522
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,454
No. You go find Kam, okay?

523
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,788
Enjoy your evening.

524
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,957
- I'm gonna be fine, okay?
- Oh, okay.

525
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,168
- Hi, Clare. Have you seen Majid?
- Hi.

526
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,587
I haven't. Maybe try the office?

527
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,671
Oh, yes.

528
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,302
- [Majid] Crystal.
- Oh, my God.

529
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,386
Oh, shit.

530
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,847
Is this part of the restaurant biz too?

531
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,223
Just let me explain.

532
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,308
Go to hell.

533
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,603
[Majid] Billie! Wait!

534
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,731
- No.
- Please, just hear me out.

535
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,192
I trusted you. You said you loved me.

536
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,610
I do love you.

537
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,196
This thing with Crystal, it's complicated.

538
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,615
You think my life isn't complicated?

539
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,076
I told you everything about my marriage,

540
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,369
about the mistakes that I made,

541
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,246
- about Brad.
- I know.

542
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,124
I didn't want any secrets
this time around,

543
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,877
so you need to be
honest with me right now.

544
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,048
Can we please
just go back inside and talk?

545
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,549
[cell phone ringing]

546
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,761
- Hudson.
- [Hudson] <i>Mommy!</i>

547
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,056
Hey, honey. Hey.
What's going on? Are you okay?

548
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,641
<i>Daddy yelled at me.</i>

549
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,519
Okay, what are you talking about?

550
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,146
- Why are you still awake?
<i>- Daddy was stuck on the bed,</i>

551
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,440
<i>and Trina was there,
and she wasn't wearing any...</i>

552
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,502
- Oh, my God.
- [Cooper] <i>Hudson! What are you doing?</i>

553
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,837
- [Billie] Cooper, what is going on?
- [Hudson] <i>I want Mommy!</i>

554
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,113
<i>I got it handled, Billie. Okay?</i>

555
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,656
<i>- It's my night.
- I want Mommy!</i>

556
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,700
Billie. Please.

557
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,537
I can't deal with you
or any of this right now.

558
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,746
I need to go see my son.

559
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,167
- I can drive you.
- Right. Because that's not complicated.

560
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,262
Fuck!

561
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,889
Hey, Sash.

562
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:50,940
Brad Simon. Trouble from Down Under.
Have you seen Billie?

563
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,902
No, is she okay? We talked earlier.

564
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,238
I'm sure she's fine.

565
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,616
Probably cozied up in a corner with Majid.

566
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,829
Hey, congrats on your big news.

567
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,707
Never thought I'd see the day.

568
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,543
You're finally gonna be a dad.

569
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,711
Yeah, it's, uh...

570
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,839
It's all happening really fast.

571
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,760
I just hope you know what you're doing.

572
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,222
For everyone's sake.

573
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,065
Any sign of her?

574
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,609
No, I looked everywhere.

575
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,112
Well, maybe she left with Majid.

576
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,948
I do hope she's all right.

577
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,996
You're such a good boyfriend.

578
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,207
Well...

579
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,001
I love you.

580
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,379
So I better be.

581
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,425
I love you too.

582
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,598
[cell phone buzzing]

583
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,856
Sorry, I gotta take this.

584
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,026
Let me guess. Mick?

585
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,782
Mick. Hey, what's up?

586
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,869
Not your Q score, that's for damn sure.
Have you seen Twitter?

587
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,330
Uh, no, why? What's wrong?

588
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,332
Open it the fuck right now.

589
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,131
[Sasha] Oh, fuck.

590
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,677
"Oh, fuck" is right, Miss Dependent.

591
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,346
We need to turn this shit around fast.

592
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,391
I don't know who this guy is,
but he's killing your brand.

593
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,412
Billie, you don't need to be here.
I told you, I've got this.

594
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,289
Are you kidding me right now?

595
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,957
What the hell were you thinking?

596
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,419
With Trina, in our house,
in front of our son?

597
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
[Hudson] Mommy!

598
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,256
Hudson!

599
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,299
Hi.

600
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,636
Let's go to bed. Oh, my big boy!

601
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,905
You've been staring at that thing
for two days straight.

602
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,074
You're gonna go cross-eyed, you know that?

603
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,328
I just can't believe it's real.

604
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,249
But you're right.
I should probably throw this away.

605
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,335
Ah-ah-ah. Not a chance.

606
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,046
I'm gonna get this thing framed. Yeah.

607
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,507
That's what I'm gonna do.

608
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,180
Honey. Are you okay?

609
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,808
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Just...

610
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,562
[clears throat]
Just all holiday-partied out, that's all.

611
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,147
I'm good.

612
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,568
I'm not sure that's it.

613
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,032
I think tonight was harder for Billie
than you said it would be.

614
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,577
And I think it was harder for you too.

615
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,831
No, Gigi, look, I told you.

616
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,794
What Billie and I had,

617
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,254
it's in the past.

618
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,594
You are my wife.

619
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,433
You're the mother of my son.

620
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,021
And I am so damn happy

621
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,649
I get to spend
the rest of my life with you.

622
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,152
Are you sure?

623
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,242
Because I know a way to make you sure.

624
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,289
To make sure that I am the only woman
on your mind.

625
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,091
[moans]

626
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,454
[Billie] Cooper?

627
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,045
Hudson's asleep.

628
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,972
Look, I know I messed up. I...

629
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,807
Cooper, just tell me what's going on.

630
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,730
I... I know you're hurting,
but Trina's your best friend's wife.

631
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,315
And what about Francesca?

632
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,774
I don't... I don't know.

633
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,277
Okay? I don't know what I'm doing.

634
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,198
I thought Francesca was the answer, but...

635
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,576
[sniffles]

636
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,288
It's like there's this...

637
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,208
this emptiness, there's this...

638
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,504
this void inside me
that I'm trying to fill.

639
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,131

Nothing feels right.

641
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,264
I just miss you, Billie.

642
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,682
I miss us...

643
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,062
together in this house with our family.

644
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
[sobbing] Oh, Cooper.

645
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,698
I am so sorry...

646

for so many things.

647
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,751
But I am especially sorry for hurting you.

648
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,422
I really do want us to work through this.

649
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,507
Maybe...

650
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:37,096
Maybe we could go to counseling after all?

651
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,352
Don't go home to the city.

652
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,816
Spend the night here.
We can wake up together with the kids.

653

That's not what I meant.

654

Yeah, but if you're not with Brad...

There's somebody else.

656

You need to go.

Hang on a second. We should talk.
