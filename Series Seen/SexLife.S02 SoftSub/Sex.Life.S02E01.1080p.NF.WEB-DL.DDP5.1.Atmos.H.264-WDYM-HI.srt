00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,082
I knew you'd go back to him.

186
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,959
This isn't about Brad.

187
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,210
This is about me.

188
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,462
It's about us. It's about our marriage.

189
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,839
Which is pretty much over,
don't you think?

190
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,591
I think we need to find out.

191
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,675
Oh, please.

192
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,054
I should have left you six months ago
and I was about to,

193
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,306
but your fucking boyfriend
convinced me to stay,

194
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,643
telling me that I was the one you wanted,
which is clearly not true.

195
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,354
I wanted it to be true.

196
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,315
But the only reason it's been working
at all the last six months

197
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,820
is because I took the blame for everything
right up until what happened with Trina.

198
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,197
Cooper, I wanna be honest...

199
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,159
with myself and you
about who I am and what I want.

200
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,954
And I want us to be able
to talk through it.

201
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,914
We should go to counseling.

202
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,374
Fuck counseling.

203
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,834
And fuck you.

204
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,836
Okay. Cooper.

205
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,214
Cooper, you don't mean that, okay?
I know you're upset...

206
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,382
[Cooper] I'm not.

207
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,465
I...

208
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,094
I'm just done.

209
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,771
There's no guy.

210
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,855
Lucky or otherwise.

211
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,691
Then lucky me.

212
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,774
No.

213
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,821
Okay, you know what?

214
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Screw it.

215
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,078
You don't wanna go out with me, okay?

216
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,290
I am a messy mess right now

217
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,708
who just blew up her life.

218
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,460
I mean, kind of unintentionally,

219
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,921
but if I'm really being honest,
completely intentionally.

220
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,758
I have two young kids.
I'm in the middle of a bitter divorce.

221
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,841
But even worse,

222
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,095
I'm pining away for the love of my life,
who is with somebody else now,

223
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,722
a fucking model,

224
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,015
and they're having a baby,

225
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,893
so I'm supposed to figure out
how to move on without him,

226
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,356
but the only problem is
I'm pretty sure I never, ever will.

227
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,692
You're something else.

228
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,778

I like it.

230
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,823
Usually, you have to put in three dates

231
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,701
before you get to
what's really going on with someone.

232
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,829
Is that the new three date rule?

233
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,539
At this point in my life...

234
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,000
it feels so much better
to just skip the dance.

235
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,460
Cut to the chase.

236
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,171
Not that I don't like to dance.

237
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,133
I'm very much looking forward
to doing the dance with you, Billie.

238
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,093
Okay.

239
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,761
You're insane. You realize that?

240
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,140
Well, not everything
has to make sense to make sense.

241
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,353
Besides, the time
right after you blow up your life...

242
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,398
it's usually the most exciting.

243
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,481
Trust me.

244
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,151
What does that mean?

245
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,486
Just that...

246
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,073
what seems like it was
the worst day of your life...

247
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,826
might actually have been the best.

248
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,411
Okay.

249
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,707
Thank you,
but I am a PhD candidate in psychology

250
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,337
which means I am drowning in aphorisms
about how crises build resilience.

251
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,966
Uh, "The future lies in you."
"Make your own tomorrow."

252
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,884
I mean, it's all I think about.

253
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,302
Maybe that's your problem.

254
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,263
Too much thinking.

255
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,516

[Sasha] <i>Look, marriage isn't for everyone.</i>

297
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,145
What's important
is that we question everything.

298
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,358
Test our assumptions and the institutions
which have grown from them.

299
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,611
Hmm. Would you ever
consider marriage yourself?

[chuckles] Hmm...

301
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,866
I recently received a proposal actually,

541
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,179
Considering we gave the court my address
as your part-time, temporary residence,

542
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,308
but you haven't spent the night there
in weeks. Where have you been?

543
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,978
Honestly, having the hottest sex
of my life with Francesca.

544
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,438
Oh, wow.

545
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,940
Well, that sounds healthy.

546
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,317
Isn't she your boss?

547
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,735
<i>So the fuck what?</i>

548
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,738
<i>She's also the woman
that's appreciated me since day one</i>

549
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,115
and who'd been warning me
about Billie for months.

550
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,742
Okay, okay. Hold on.

551
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,036
I know we're all supposed
to be hating on Billie,

552
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,039
but she is the mother of your children,
and she will be for life,

553
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,583
and you need to deal with that
one way or the other.

554
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,793
<i>Hopefully, that doesn't
turn you into an asshole</i>

555
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,147
with a giant chip on your shoulder
and hate in your heart,

556
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,591
because trust me, I was that guy.
That is not you.

557
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,177
Hey, you okay?

558
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,016
<i>Maybe I am that guy now. Maybe I changed.</i>

559
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,434
Maybe I smartened up.

560
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,979
[Spencer] <i>You've always been the knight
in shining armor ever since we were kids.</i>

561
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,817
<i>Do you remember senior year
when I snuck into the city</i>

562
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,361
to go to my first gay club?

563
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,904
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

564
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,824
I got so drunk flirting with that kid
who said he was in the Blue Man Group

565
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,828
that I ended up
in the East Village at 3 a.m.,

566
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:48,333
with no shirt, shoes, wallet,
just a bunch of blue handprints on my ass.

567
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,667
That's a classic.

568
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,088
<i>And who showed up?
Dependable, sober, gave me a ride home.</i>

569
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,924
Even proofread my capstone paper for me.

570
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,467
I did.

571
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,220
<i>So go on, shack up with your hottie boss
all you want.</i>

572
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,722
<i>I've seen worse post-divorce
freak-outs before, but...</i>

573
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,143
someday, I hope you remember
who you really are.

574
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,772
A nice guy.

575
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,524
<i>It's not a bad thing.</i>

576
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,901
It's what I love most about you.

577
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,906
- I'll talk to you later.
<i>- Coop...</i>

578
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,160
[pop music playing over speakers]

579
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,423
Hi.

580
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,468
You made it.

581
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,265
I wasn't 100% sure you would show.

582
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,518
Well, you put a reminder alarm
on my phone, so...

583
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,271
- Did I? That was smart.
- Mm.

584
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,858
I thought we could sit
at the chef's counter,

585
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,861
- get a sense how this place tastes.
- Yeah, sure. Great.

586
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,944
Come with me.

587
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,240
Um, shouldn't we check in
with the hostess first?

588
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,367
You're acting like you own the place.

589
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,912
Uh, well, I don't own all of it.

590
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,330
At least not yet.

591
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,999
I have investors, but...

592
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:17,547
yeah, this is mine.

593
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,218
This is what I blew up my life to come do.

594
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,137
Come on.

595
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,407
<i>Bellissima.</i>

596
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,536
What is going on?

597
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,747
I thought you said dinner.

598
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,707
Oh, there will be food.

599
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,128
Seriously, what are we doing here?

600
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,633
This is our place.

601
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,258
I know.

602
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,888
Okay, fine.

603
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,726
I wanted to do
something special to celebrate,

604
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,524
because I didn't just run into you
this morning by chance.

605
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,735
I was given a choice of dates,

606
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,863
and when I saw your name on the list,
I knew I had to go today,

607
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,158
just to see your face,
even if you were married,

608
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:32,205
even if it was nothing more
than a catch up between old friends.

609
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,251
We were never just friends.

610
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,214
You wanna come inside and have a look?

611
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,275
Oh, my God. I can't.

612
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,818
But, yes, bring it on.

613
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,862
Bring me everything.

614
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,948
I think this is actually
one of everything on our menu.

615
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,076
Mm. You did the ordering, not me.

616
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,705
Oh.

617
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,915
I like that you like to eat.

618
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,043
Well, I like that your food
is so damn good.

619
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,089
- Are all of these recipes yours?
- Oh, yeah. Well...

620
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,384
some of them were borrowed from my mom.

621
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,927
She must be so proud.

622
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,679
I think she's getting there.

623
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:35,685
But no one was happy
when I moved to New York.

624
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,273
I used to be in finance.

625
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,358
In Doha.

626
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,735
You're kidding me.

627
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,529
I did everything
the way I was supposed to.

628
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,825
I had everything I was supposed to want.

629
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,367
Except?

630
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,166
Nothing felt... right.

631
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,336
'Cause way down deep,

632
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:06,174
there was this itch for something more

633
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,511
and a sinking feeling that if I didn't
put aside all the supposed-to's

634
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,890
and at least try to go for it, for this...

635
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,353
dream I've had since I was a little boy,

636
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,023
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

637
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,984
That's really brave.

638
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,154
I need you to talk to my mom.

639
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,198
I'm not sure she saw it that way.

640
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,953
I had just enough money for a food truck
when I got here.

641
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,498
- I started at the Brooklyn Flea.
- I love that place.

642
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,834
I slept in that truck for months.

643
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,172
But now, six years later...

644
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,470
turns out, that itch was right.

645
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,808
That itch...

646
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,770
has gotten me into trouble my whole life.

647
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,188
That's good trouble.

648
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,483
Appetite, desire,

649
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,778
those are the things
that tell you you're still alive.

650
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,322
Otherwise, what's the point?

651
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,428
[Sasha] So you wanna tell me
how you pulled this off?

652
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,304
Well, I have my ways.

653
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,849
Running an NGO
with a board full of New York's richest

654
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,226
and most powerful has its perks.

655
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,309
Ah.

656
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,855
You still a Goya fan?

657
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,734
Well, the <i>Nude Maja</i> always have
a very special place in my heart.

658
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,030
- No, I'm actually into abstract art now.
- Oh.

659
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,657
I've learned that life
isn't always so straight ahead.

660
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,869
You think things are going one way,
and then...

661
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,416
Something happens,
which turns everything upside down.

662
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,339
Come here.

663
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,517
[Sasha] Oh, my God. Kam...

664
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,437
what did you do?

665
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,566
I'm just saying,
there's a hidden narrative

666
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,320
about existential freedom
that was absolutely intentional.

667
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,199
What, you don't buy it?

668
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,870
- I have something to tell you.
- Okay.

669
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,250
I got into Stanford Med School.

670
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,087
What are you talking about?

671
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,298
We made a list of where we were applying
so we could stay together,

672
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,177
- and Stanford was not on it.
- I know, I know. It was a wild shot.

673
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,971
I didn't tell you
because I didn't think I'd get in.

674
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,056
But now...

675
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
You wanna go.

676
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,560
It's Stanford.

677
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,276
I am gonna miss you so much.

678
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,362
You don't have to.

679
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,948
Come with me.

680
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:21,661
Kam, I didn't even apply to any
grad programs anywhere in California.

681
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,122
- What am I gonna do out there?
- You surf.

682
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,999
Lay on the beach, drink great wine.

683
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,211
But that's not what I want.
That's not who I am.

684
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,506
You really think I'd be happy
just watching you go off

685
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,842
and start your career
while mine dies on the vine.

686
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,844
We'll check out schools
when you get there.

687
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,264
You can enroll in spring semester
or take the year.

688
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,849
But I'm already behind,

689
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:46,352
because I took a semester off
to follow you to Rome.

690
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,064
It was Rome,

691
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,567
and this is California.

692
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,903
This is what our life is, baby,
grand adventures.

693
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,780
I just want us to take them together.

694
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,616
I do too, but...

695
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,952
You know what?

696
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,370
Come on.

697
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,499
Let's take the biggest adventure of all.

698
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,548
Kam, what are you doing?

699
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,134
What I should have done
that night in Rome.

700
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,978
Marry me, Sasha Snow.

701
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,358
I will give you a life bigger
and better than you ever dreamed.

702
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,862
When I'm through this program,
we can go anywhere you want.

703
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,532
I just... I don't wanna
wake up a single morning

704
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,660
without you in my arms.

705
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,920
Okay, fine.

706
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,379
Is that a yes?

707
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,049
- Are you gonna be my wife, Sasha Snow?
- Yes!

708
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,218
- Yes?
- Yes, yes.

709
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,386
- [Kam] Yes? Oh, my God.
- [Sasha] Yes.

710
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,972
- [crowd cheering]
- [both laughing]

711
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,981
It's been 17 years,

712
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,401
and I have never stopped
