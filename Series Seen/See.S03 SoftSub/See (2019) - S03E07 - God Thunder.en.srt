My sister hunted us for 17 years.

522
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,294
She didn't stop then,
and she won't stop now.

She will never stop hunting this family.

I'm saying that you were right all along.

00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,315

or further even,

where we can be the family we once were.

530
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:55,163
Maybe with me gone,

531
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:58,876
my sister will be less inclined
to direct her wrath at the Payans.

Are you sure?

533

I have been a mother much longer
than I've been a queen.

534
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:16,059
And if my family coming first
means I'm a bad queen...

that I... I shouldn't be one.

why we eat bison and deer, but not bear?

When you hunt bison and deer,
they run away,

better than I know myself, and so do you.

689
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:18,931
He's gone back.

690
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:21,725
- What?
- Why would he do that?

691
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,144
He can't defeat an entire army by himself.

692
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:28,315
He's gone to kill my sister.

[SNIFFS]

696
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:16,864
You really do smoke too much.

697
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,575
No such thing.

698
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:26,790
Where are you headed?

699
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,753
I'm gonna hunt down that demon queen
and cut out her heart.

700
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:34,089
Aw, sounds like a terrible idea.

701
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:35,382
Can I come?

702
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,466
Sure.

703
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,303
Beware of wolves, Baba Voss.

704
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:41,763
We are the fucking wolves.

705
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,307
All right.
