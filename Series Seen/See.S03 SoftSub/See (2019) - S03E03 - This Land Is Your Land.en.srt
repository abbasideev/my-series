What is the point in waiting

00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,298
Her delay clearly demonstrates

215
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,344
that Pennsa has no intention in honoring

We've defeated the Ganite hordes,

694
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,342
- Sibeth!
- [WOLFFE CRYING]

695
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:11,428
[SHUSHES] You've woken the baby.

696
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:13,722
Ah. There, there.

697
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:15,307
It's only Grandpa.

698
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,685
He's come to say goodbye
before Mama takes you on a trip.

699
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:25,150
- Put the boy down.
- Stay back or I will slice fast and hard.

700
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,693
My blade is at his neck.

701
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:32,991
He is your child.

702
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:37,871
Yes, he is mine.
And I will kill him before I lose him.

703
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:40,582
[BABA VOSS] You would kill your own child?

704
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:45,754
I'm going to be lectured on murder
by a Trivantian slaver.

705
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,801
How many souls did you capture,
sell, kill?

706
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,263
I'd have to drown ten Kanzuas
to compete with you.

707
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:55,597
Now, let me go.

708
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:00,894
[GASPS, BREATHING SHAKILY]

709
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:06,066
You killed your own father.

710
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,402
You killed your own brother.

711
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,780
Oh, will you kill your own grandchild too?

712
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:19,371
There is no place you can go
that I will not find you.

713
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:23,709
You couldn't find me in your own house.
Hmm.

714
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,712
What the fuck is happening?

715
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,714
- [BABA VOSS GROWLS]
- Kofun.

716
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,384
[EXHALES HEAVILY]
There's been a change of plans.

717
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,220
I'm grateful for your help,
but I can no longer hide

718
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,222
in the walls like a restless spirit.

719
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:38,515
It's time to leave.

720
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,142
- You freed her?
- Dad.

721
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,060
Wait, Sibeth. Please, just give him to me.

722
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:44,438
I can't have the same conversation twice.

723
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,398
You see my blade at his neck. Let me pass.

724
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:47,774
You're not taking my son.

725
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:50,152
He is my son. [CHUCKLES]

726
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,946
I made him. I carried him.

727
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:56,450
But don't worry, Wolffie will return

728
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,161
when I take back my kingdom
and place him on the throne.

729
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,246
You're out of your fucking mind.
That's never gonna happen.

730
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,581
He is the child of prophecy.

731
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,041
He can't see!

732
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:09,087
There's no fucking prophecy.

733
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:12,508
He doesn't have my eyes, he has yours.

734
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,513
Which means he isn't some blessed savior,
which means you aren't chosen by God.

735
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:19,473
You're lying.

736
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:24,019
[KOFUN] We promised to always
tell each other the truth.

737
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:25,103
You know I'm not.

738
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:27,981
[BREATHING SHAKILY]

739
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:35,280
[INHALES SHARPLY] Well, then you know
I will kill your blind baby.

740
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,949
- [SIBETH] Let me go.
- [KOFUN] No.

741
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:39,159
- [KOFUN SCREAMS]
- [BABA VOSS] Kofun!

742
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,995
- [BABA VOSS GRUNTS]
- [SCREAMS]

743
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,747
[BABA VOSS GRUNTING]

744
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,500
- [WOLFFE CRYING]
- [BABA VOSS] Kofun, let me feel.

745
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:48,669
You're bleeding badly.

746
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:50,963
[CRYING CONTINUES]

747
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,047
[KOFUN PANTING]

748
00:52:57,302 --> 00:52:58,303
[BABA VOSS] Kofun.
