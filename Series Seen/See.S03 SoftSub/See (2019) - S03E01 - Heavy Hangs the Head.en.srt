But maybe it was that act of God
that put you in this spot to begin with.

I assume your people know
by now where to set up camp.

You will wanna wash up,
get some rest.

Where's the queen?
Will she not be greeting me?

694
00:50:20,054 --> 00:50:24,062
The queen has entrusted me with
the resolution of this matter.

695

Has she now?

696
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:29,628
Yes, she has.

00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,597

I'll have it resolved by dinner.

Well, then, I'm very
much anticipating our dinner.

Don't worry about the nasty man.

709
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:35,590
He may make some scary noises,
but he's empty inside. Weak and hollow.

I'd be quiet, Sibeth.

What are you doing here?

712

I don't know exactly, but we
will not be handing her over today.

713
00:51:43,543 --> 00:51:45,809
You would defend her at
the cost of your own kingdom?

714
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:47,445
It's not her kingdom.

A queen who gives away her own
sister in the name of peace

716

Not this sister.

He'll have to take
his revenge some other day.

Let me take her.

I'm sorry.

Maghra, I do believe
your general is sulking.

You think I'm making a mistake?

more than a little fond of you.
