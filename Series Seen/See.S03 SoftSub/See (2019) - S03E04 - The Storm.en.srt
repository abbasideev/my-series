00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:53,785
[MAGHRA] Lord Torrance?

703
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:55,537
My queen.

704
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:57,789
Tamacti Jun.

705
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:00,667
We will need the Witchfinders as well.

706
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,170
They must be convinced to join us.

707
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,839
You executed three of them
just the other day.

708
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:09,134
But I spared the rest.
We will have to try.

709
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:16,266
[LUCIEN] Great and mighty God Flame,
warm us with your grace.

710
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,562
Grant us the strength
in these troubled times

711
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,150
to cling to our faith
and execute your will.

712
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,403
Ever since Kanzua fell,

713
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,698
it feels like
the Payan Kingdom has lost its way.

714
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:36,245
The Payan citizens are counting on us
to hold the line.

715
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:37,955
So that's what we will do.

716
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,415
And I know, like you do...

717
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:44,253
we're going to get bloody doing it.

718
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,421
They've already hung some of us,

719
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,966
and we may all swing
when this is through.

720
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:54,805
But like you, I will die a holy death
before I live an unholy life.

721
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,015
- Lucien.
- Not now, Shiloh.

722
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:58,183
The queen is here.

723
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,866
Queen Maghra. This is a surprise.

724
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:15,576
Maghra is not your queen.
