00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,132

for all the years of your reign,

00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:13,347
traveling to the farthest reaches
of the kingdom to rid the world of evil.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,975
Then you rejected the divine doctrines,

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,688
tearing us apart
and forcing us into hiding.

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,693
Now you say you want us
to serve you once more,

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,321
as if all of that never happened?

8
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,865
Yes, that's right.

9
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,118
So I ask you now,

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,789
why the fuck would we do that?

11
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:44,044
Why not just execute you as a heretic
and be done with it?

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,593
Lucien is right.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,723
I have caused you all pain and distress.

14
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:00,519
And for that,
you have my deepest apologies.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,444
My sister, long believed to be dead,
was returned to me.

16
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,282
And in my joy,

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,080
and in my gratitude to the God Flame,
I opened my heart.

18
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,209
And my sister bewitched me.

19
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,589
She and her two witch children.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,010
And I lost my way.

21
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,850
Just like you,
I have suffered dearly for it.

22
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,478
I've been in leg irons
for the last nine months.

23
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,647
They starved me. They tortured me.

24
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,733
They took my baby from me.

25
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,199
But it wasn't them.

26
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,579
No, they were merely instruments
of the God Flame herself.

27
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,664
Testing me.

28
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,419
Putting me through trials
to purify my heart once more,

29
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,466
so that I might reclaim my holy kingdom
for the righteous.

30
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,469
And why should we believe you now?

31
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,555
Why should you believe me?

32
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,936
Because I am your queen!

33
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,443

35
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:40,118
And no human will change that.
Not my sister, not the Trivantians.

36
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,203
And not you, Lucien.

37
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,293
It was I who declared war
on the Trivantians,

38
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,756
I who foretold our miraculous victory
at Greenhill Gap.

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,389
And since then, my execution
has been called for by Tamacti Jun,

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,435
by my sister and her corrupted council,
by the Trivantians.

41
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,524
And yet, somehow, none of them
could manage the simple task

42
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,359
of putting a blade to my throat,

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,946
nor could their chains hold me.

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,866
And the God Flame sent me out to find you.

45
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,703
You are soldiers with no country...

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,082
with no rightful claim to the crown.

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,877
One of two fates await you.

48
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,338
You'll either be hunted down
by my sister's army,

49
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,134
or become slaves to the Trivantians.

50
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,887
Why should you believe me?

51
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,601
Because I'm all you've got!
And I love you all!
