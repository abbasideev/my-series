made their position very clear.

529
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,297
Politicians following a script
they know nothing about.

530
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:53,717
The war over vision will be fought,

531
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,472
not between Paya and Trivantes,
but within cities.

532
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:01,350
Within families.

533
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,436
Within our own hearts.

534
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,690
Regardless, nature will have its way.

535
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,193
She always does.

536
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,031
Well...

537
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,785
you seem to have made
your own peace with it.

538
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:23,747
The single advantage
to being as horribly wrong

539
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:29,211
as I've been in my life
is that new ideas are easier to accept.

540
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:33,298
[SNIFFLING]

541
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,176
[SIGHS] Smells like death.

542
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,481
I think Baba always knew
he would die in battle.

543
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:51,900
He told me once,

544
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:56,196
death must be earned
every bit as much as life.

545
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,076
With his last breath,
he defeated an entire army.

546
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:04,454
And by doing so, saved us all.

547
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:07,541
I think his death was well earned.

548
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,836
You sound a bit envious.

549
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,255
[CHUCKLES] Maybe.

550
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:18,260
But while I'm still walking here
on this earth,

551
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,471
I'll do my best
to keep you out of trouble.

552
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:29,897
[SIGHS]

553
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,774
I would be lost without you, Tamacti.

554
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,736
How so very sad for both of us.

555
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:37,654
[CHUCKLES]

556
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:48,123
[MAGHRA] I miss him, Ranger.

557
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,794
Baba was a giant man,

558
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:56,381
so it makes sense
that there's a giant-sized hole

559
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,258
in the space he used to fill.

560
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,303
[SIGHS]

561
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,598
You know, Baba died for you.

562
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:06,767
For all of us.

563
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:12,272
But it's important
to remember not that he died for you,

564
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,900
but that he lived for you.

565
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,320
If he was here, that's what he would say.

566
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,787
I hear Lu has arrived.

567
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,205
Yes.

568
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,292
Yes, we head home tomorrow.

569
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,378
You're welcome to stay.

00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,630

571
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:41,176
Thanks, um, but, uh, Lu and I,

572
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,557
we don't like crowds or people,
you know, crowds of people.

573
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,975
- Mmm.
- [CHUCKLES]

574
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,352
Well, I could give you a horse.

575
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:54,731
- Nah. [LAUGHS]
- [CHUCKLES]

576
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:57,609
- The wolves will just eat it.
- [CHUCKLES]

00:46:57,693 --> 00:47:00,153
[CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES]

578
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,830
[CHARLOTTE] Haniwa!

579
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:12,958
Charlotte?

580
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:15,878
[GASPS]

581
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:17,629
- [CHUCKLES]
- Haniwa!

582
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,590
Charlotte! [LAUGHS]

583
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:24,094
[CHUCKLES] Hey.

584
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:27,055
[SIGHS] I didn't know
if you were coming back.

585
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:29,600
Nah, I'm not back. Not for long anyway.

586
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:32,269
I just needed to make sure you were okay.

587
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:33,604
[CHUCKLES]

588
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:36,231
I'm so sorry to hear about Baba.

589
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:37,399
Ah.

590
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,151
Then I heard that you
and Wren got married,

591
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:40,819
and I'm so happy about that.

592
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,697
And now I don't know if I should talk
about the sad thing first

593
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,575
and then the happy thing?
Or do it the other way,

594
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:48,243
or maybe you don't wanna talk
about it at all.

595
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,661
[CHUCKLING]

596
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:54,875
How did it go with the Compass?
How are Sheva and the kids?

597
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,168
Well, the little ones are great.

598
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,128
[SIGHS] I don't think Sheva
likes me very much.

599
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,672
But I don't like her either,
so, you know, that'll work out.

600
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:05,427
Oh. She asked me to give you this.

601
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:08,972
She said you'd know what it means.

602
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:15,687
[CHUCKLES]

603
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:38,126
She wishes you a safe journey.

604
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:43,757
So... I take it you're going somewhere?

605
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:48,053
Will you come with us?

606
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,099
Not this time.

607
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:56,645
- But it's nice to be asked.

608

Who will keep me safe?

00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:03,694
- [CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES]
- You have Wren for that now.

610
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,029
And she has you.

611
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:09,116
I am needed at the Compass.

612
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,703
Jerlamarel's children
will be keeping us busy and...

613
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,372
I get the feeling more will be coming.

614
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:17,708
They are lucky to have you.

00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,127
- Ugh, tell that to them.

616
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,796
- Little fuckers. [CHUCKLES]

You be careful out there.

You too.

620
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,735
[HANIWA] Thank you.

00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:48,614
[CHARLOTTE] It was my pleasure.

00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,033
I'm not crying.

You're the sighted one. [CHUCKLES]

you don't want to say goodbye?

[KOFUN] Mmm.

638
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:16,535
It's been almost a year
and still no word from Haniwa.

639
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,997
It could be a while till we hear from her.

640
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:23,041
Do you ever think about the Alkenny?

641
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,419
Every day.

642
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,297
Just the four of us, always together.

643
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:34,344
I'm sure we were sometimes cold,
but in my memories it's always warm.

644
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,222
[KOFUN SIGHS]

645
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:41,393
I thought when I became queen,

646
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,313
I would be able to give us that.

647
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,816
But once we set out
to find the Lavender road,

648
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:51,153
we were never going
to be that family again.

649
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:53,322
No.

650
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,201
But we are still a family.

00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:00,662
[SNIFFLES]

652
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:04,791
You handle yourself well with the council.

653
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,377
You've earned their trust.

654
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:13,509
Maybe... you were born to do this.

655
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:16,845
Well, Haniwa says the kingdom
would never accept a sighted king.

656
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,848
What do you say?

657
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:26,647
I know what Dad would say. He would say,

658
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:31,193
"Think like a blind man.
Your eyes betray you." [CHUCKLES]

659
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,909

And they will again.

00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,501
What are you saying?

662
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:52,130
[SIGHS] My mother is queen.

663
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:55,634
My father died trying
to save this kingdom.

If they weren't my people before,
they are now.

of the world is different from theirs.

I'm saying, I think I've seen enough.

668
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,914
I want to live in the same world
as my son.
