1
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:46,461
Sounds like the place.

2
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,723
I couldn't believe there were
two parties on this block.

3
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,162
I have no problem with Negroes.

4
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,530
I'm just worried about the car.

5
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,001
We can still go home.
This was your idea.

6
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,163
It's important that
we're here, for you.

7
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:58,672
For the people that work for you.

8
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,072
Lovely, go easy on that.

9
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,609
Some of them don't feel that way.

10
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,008
Is my nose running?

11
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,361
- How are you?
- Hi.

12
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:29,733
Sorry about that, buddy.

13
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,397
What did you do with your coats?

14
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,202
We left them in the car.

15
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:36,437
When we called to get directions
from somewhere else in New Jersey,

16
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:38,275
Paul gave Harry the idea.

17
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,076
I took my purse.

18
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,777
I can smell alcohol, but I don't see it.

19
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,182
It's him.

20
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,914
It's a party.

21
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,455
Cosgrove's doing great.

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,817
Let's go get a drink.

23
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,484
I'm going to stay here.

24
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,027
Come with me.

25
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:02,432
So you work for these stuffed shirts?

26
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:03,732
I work with them.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,035
Peggy. Glad to see a familiar face.

28
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,336
Yes. How are you?

29
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:08,774
Introduce us to your friend.

30
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,072
Eugene, whom I just met,

31
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,612
was telling me that at Princeton

32
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,046
Paul used to dress up like a girl.

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,517
According to him,
that's the way Shakespeare did it.

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,815
Looking stunning, as always.

35
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,981
Much too good for him.

36
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,650
What are you doing out here?

37
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:26,786
Not enough subterraneans
in the Village?

38
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,524
I'm here because this isn't
Greenwich Village.

39
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:30,963
This is America.

40
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,329
How do you get to the city?

41
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,199
The number 33 bus takes you
right to Port Authority.

42
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,363
Trust me, Montclair is the knees.

43
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,964
We have Globe Trotter Antiques.

44
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,543
We have the Wellmont Theater.

45
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,306
Silent movies with organ.

46
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,642
The Montclair Art Gallery.

47
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,773
George Inness. Have you heard of him?

48
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:48,976
Of course I have.

49
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,712
Come.

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,219
Enjoy.

51
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,811
Imbibe.

52
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,898
You're a button, you know that?

53
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,024
And you're drunk.

54
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:10,097
Can't get Donna here on my desk
because she keeps refusing.

55
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,231
You're not allowed to do that.

56
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:14,536
I can't feel my cheeks.

57
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,202
I can.

58
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,677
I feel them fine.

59
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,907
My mother says when you
can't feel your cheeks,

60
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,450
it's time to stop.

61
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:25,749
Well, what do I do with this?

62
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,653
There. That works.

63
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,521
Oh, my God.

64
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:33,288
Don't you and Kitty
have some place to be?

65
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,557
Apparently, when they say "on call,"

66
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:41,068
it does not mean "available by phone."

67
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,569
You have to be in the hospital.

68
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,333
I'm sorry he didn't make it.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,839
I'm looking forward to meeting him.

70
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:48,775
I've been having this pain right here.

71
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:49,936
You've met him.

72
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,570
How could I forget?

73
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,775
Big, handsome, saves people's lives.

74
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,879
Why did you get the nice glass?

75
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,424
Because I have the Rhône Gallagher.

76
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:04,753
Fine. What is it?

77
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,853
There's a ship that went down in 1871,

78
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:10,125
and the casks of Rhône were on it.

79
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,666
It was a very good year.

80
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,394
And it sank,

81
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,404
and they washed up
on shore two years ago,

82
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,736
and they sold 180 bottles,

83
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,706
and I have one.

84
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,437
But not a sofa.

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,178
Joan, I want you to meet someone.

86
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:27,874
My baby... Sheila.

87
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,281
Sheila White.

88
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,110
Joan is our senior secretary.

89
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,518
Office manager.

90
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,056
Sheila's an assistant manager.

91
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:37,091
At the Food Fair in South Orange.

92
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,285
She's saving for school.

93
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:40,862
- Kinsey!
- What?

94
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:42,954
The man upstairs is here.

95
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,362
God?

96
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,402
No. It's Mr. Hoffenberg.

97
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,403
He wants to talk to you.

98
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,564
He smells marijuana.

99
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,209
Don't talk until I get back.

100
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,007
I'm serious.

101
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,575
I don't think we have
a Food Fair in Manhattan.

102
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,516
Is it a big market with a parking lot?

103
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,814
It is.

104
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,116
Well, one day you'll drive in

105
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,690
in a station wagon
and be a customer.

106
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,554
I grew up out here.

107
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,820
I've already been a customer.

108
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:17,097
It's fun to meet the boys,
put faces with names.

109
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,099
Well, it's good to see
you and Paul together.

110
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,761
I have to say, when Paul
and I were together,

111
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:24,863
the last thing I would have
taken him for was open-minded.

112
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,340
I love your purse.

113
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,170
Thanks. I just got it.

114
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,383
What's that?

115
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,690
Marjorie. Works at the newsstand.

116
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,225
I like.

117
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,056
But behind her.

118
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,220
You stole that.

119
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,993
That's from the office.

120
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,795
That dumb girl almost got fired.

121
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,631
But she didn't.

122
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm a writer. I need it.

123
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:09,913
Hey, Brooklyn, come home with me.

124
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,387
Why not? I live alone.

125
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,322
Why should I?

126
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:20,361
Because I like you,
and we're having a good time,

127
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,260
and I'm a good kisser,

128
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,697
and you know you want to.

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,597
Eugene.

130
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:29,500
I'm in the persuasion business,

131
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:33,006
and frankly, I'm disappointed
by your presentation.

132
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,208
Come on.

133
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:22,284
Fifth Avenue's a parking lot,
in both directions.

134
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:24,757
Traffic makes the parade look bigger.

135
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,327
What parade?

136
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,953
Colonel Glenn.

137
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,695
It's incredible what passes
for heroism these days.

138
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,827
I'd like ticker tape
for pulling out of my driveway

139
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,666
and going around the block three times.

140
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:39,206
It's not like people were shooting at him.

141
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,639
I think he's a winner.

142
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,303
Square jaw, false modesty.

143
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,539
Looks like he just took off
his letterman jacket.

144
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,173
You going to go down there
with your autograph book at lunch?

145
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,462
Can I just fire everyone?

146
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,523
Excuse me!

147
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,897
Excuse me!

148
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,940
This is a place of business.

149
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,875
Colonel Glenn will be on Earth
for the rest of his life.

150
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,411
Plane went down.

151
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,344
American Airlines
Flight 1 to Los Angeles.

152
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,609
Crashed in Jamaica Bay.

153
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,481
...had suddenly become locked
in a death dive into the bay...

154
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,646
There could be
a hundred people on there.

155
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,121
Just fell out of the sky.

156
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:32,217
...turn prescribed
by Idlewild Airport rules.

157
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,923
The Federal Aviation Agency
said there is no rational basis

158
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:40,263
for grounding the Boeing 707
as a result of the crash.

159
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,497
Federal Aviation
administrator Najeeb Halaby

160
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,130
- summarizing...
- Turn it off.

161
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,436
...of the investigation
said there was no...

162
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,340
Pull all Mohawk ROP.

163
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,970
And anything in production, stop it.

164
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,810
But it wasn't a Mohawk plane.

165
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,508
We don't want people
opening their morning paper

166
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,178
and seeing a Mohawk ad
next to a picture of a floating engine.

167
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:01,246
The rest of you, stop crying

168
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,518
and figure out how we're going
to hit the ground running

169
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,651
in three weeks with new work.

170
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,887
Excuse me.

171
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,725
Well, for one thing,

172
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,925
we should probably avoid
the term "hit the ground."

173
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,764
How about "Idlewild to Rockaway
in less than eight minutes"?

174
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,335
Answer the phone, sweetheart.

175
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,114
- Some of the passengers...
- Sterling Cooper.

176
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,012
...were on their way
to a golf tournament.

177
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,142
Apparently, the minute the plane hit,

178
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,514
the bay turned plaid.

179
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,817
Get back to work.

180
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,287
Jets are made for dropping
bombs on Moscow,

181
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,693
not French cuisine.

182
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,926
Although I like those
little girls they have.

183
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:50,062
You know, they're completely captive.

184
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,338
Mr. Phillips to see you.

185
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,409
Send him in.

186
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,986
Someone should tell Draper
to pull everything from Mohawk.

187
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,248
He knows that.

188
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,917
I just had an interesting conversation
with Shel Keneally.

189
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,584
He's inside of American Airlines.

190
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,026
Is the plane still crashed?

191
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,459
Shel was a client
when I was at Y&R in London.

192
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,228
We had some times together.

193
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:24,663
It's complete chaos over there.

194
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,570
They have any idea what went wrong?

195
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:27,801
None.

196
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,641
Normal takeoff, perfect weather.

197
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,338
The thing just nose-dived, exploded.

198
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:33,938
That's not comforting.

199
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,582
Shel says they're going to
need to make a fresh start.

200
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:39,119
Did he say "fresh start"?

201
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,121
A few times.

202
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,825
That is an interesting phone call.

203
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,798
Yes.

204
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,301
Yes.

205
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,170
I can't talk right now.

206
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,773
Mr. Campbell, are you all right?

207
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,213
Mr. Campbell?

208
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,224
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

209
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,262
What's going on?

210
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,722
I just got off the phone with my brother.

211
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:02,362
It's the strangest thing.

212
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,065
Apparently, my father
was on that plane.

213
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,641
What?

214
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:14,109
My father, he was on the plane.

215
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:24,285
God, I'm sorry to hear that.

216
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:30,823
I don't know what to do.

217
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:36,802
I just saw him at the barber.

218
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:39,305
Paul Molé on Lex.

219
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,439
What does one do?

220
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,386
Make arrangements, I guess.

221
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,920
What am I supposed to do?

222
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,688
What people do.

223
00:12:58,794 --> 00:12:59,988
Go home.

224
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,956
I don't even think
I know how old he was.

225
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,729
Someone's going to ask that.

226
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,669
I don't know. I suppose.

227
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,036
You know what?

228
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,201
I don't think I'm going to tell anyone.

229
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,908
Am I going to cry?

230
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,043
You just had a shock.

231
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,983
I wouldn't...

232
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:28,181
worry about what you're feeling.

233
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,520
Go home and be with your family.

234
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,594
Why?

235
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:35,128
Because that's what people do.

236
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,822
Is that what you would do?

237
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,059
Yes.

238
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,668
Really?

239
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,002
Yes.

240
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,946
Everything's exactly the same.

241
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,316
You should go home.

242
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:06,619
What about the Stouffer's meeting?

243
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:08,923
I'll cancel it.

244
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:10,396
It's not hurting anything.

245
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:17,734
There's life, and there's work.

246
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,482
Hey, I got one.

247
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:32,713
"Mohawk Airlines...

248
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,415
when you need to make it
past Jamaica Bay."

249
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:38,322
How about "American...
pioneering vertical flight"?

250
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:43,292
Mr. Draper, Mr. Cooper
would like to see you.

251
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,271
I spoke with Hank Lamont
over at Mohawk.

252
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,105
How are they doing over there?

253
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,906
He says they can weather it out.

254
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,105
I always get the feeling

255
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,273
that man opens his front door
and money comes in.

256
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,748
Always cleaned me out.

257
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,216
Best poker player in the South Pacific.

258
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,719
Duck, tell Don here
about your phone call.

259
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,916
Well, I put in a call to check in
with Shel Keneally

260
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,617
over at American Airlines.

261
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,786
He used to run International.
We're old pals.

262
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,295
He picked up the phone?

263
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,557
What's going on over there?

264
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,030
Shel says it's bedlam.

265
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:19,794
Anyway, he was
quite clear about the fact

266
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,460
that they're going
to want to make changes

267
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,561
if they want the dust to settle fast.

268
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,969
What does that mean?

269
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:29,134
It means they'll be looking
for a new image

270
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:32,008
and thus a new agency.

271
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,845
What's it been, four, three hours

272
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:38,476
since the plane went down?

273
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,884
You'll have to forgive me

274
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,218
for not looking at a bunch
of bodies in Jamaica Bay

275
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:43,484
and seeing the opportunity.

276
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,219
Adding a few hours or a day or a week

277
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,658
doesn't make this any more
of an opportunity.

278
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:48,753
- We already have an airline.
- We don't have American.

279
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,525
That's right, we have
the one whose planes

280
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,429
didn't just fall out of the sky.

281
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,933
That's good.

282
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,526
I'm sorry. Is there an issue?

283
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,969
$1 million. $7 million.

284
00:15:58,073 --> 00:15:59,131
Am I missing something?

285
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,765
Did you sign American
during this phone call?

286
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,241
No, but Shel made it very clear

287
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:05,279
that if we can get rid of our conflict,
he'd love to hear our ideas.

288
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,506
It's a serious foothold.

289
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,049
A foothold.
I'd do anything for a foothold.

290
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,016
This is how it works.

291
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,986
We got a regional airline
so we'd have a shot at a big one.

292
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,852
I know how you had it in your head.

293
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,983
The President of American Airlines
sees a Mohawk ad,

294
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,459
falls in love, and says
"Get me that guy."

295
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,190
I'm sorry it didn't play out that way.

296
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,925
Easy.

297
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:33,505
We have a good client who trusts us,
who likes our work,

298
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,305
who pays their bills on time.

299
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,242
They don't deserve
to be thrown out the door

300
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,974
for a wink from American.

301
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,277
I can't believe this.

302
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:45,950
Anything else?

303
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,121
He'll be fine.

304
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:06,066
I'll need to cancel
my reservations to Sarasota

305
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:09,143
and, of course, Andrew's return flight.

306
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,843
But l... Well, they can't possibly expect...

307
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,177
I'm sure that's taken care of.

308
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,842
Dunham's taking care of all that.

309
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,647
Bud's on the phone
with him right now.

310
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,881
I'm sure he'll forget something.

311
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,517
There's no way that he
can remember everything.

312
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,925
Bud's very good with things like this.

313
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,830
Is he aware there is no way
to have a funeral without the remains?

314
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,298
What's the difference?

315
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,802
You're right.

316
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,897
There's just so much to do.

317
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:42,503
What is that?

318
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,206
What?

319
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,781
That.

320
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,747
That.

321
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:52,913
What is that?

322
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:55,951
Take it.

323
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,457
I want you to have it.

324
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,622
He was such a fine man,

325
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,326
so well-mannered, civic.

326
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,130
My father admired him.

327
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:10,136
What a nice thing to say.

328
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,331
I like to offer a nice
bouquet of thoughts.

329
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:26,181
Did you take care of everything?

330
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,915
They do this all the time.

331
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,117
- What?
- I took care of it.

332
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:35,288
Give me another one
of those, a big one.

333
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,728
Dunham had
some unpleasant news.

334
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:42,167
Dad was insolvent, broke.

335
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,135
Is there enough for a funeral?

336
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:47,766
As if the idea of a will
never crossed your mind?

337
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,468
We weren't going to get that.

338
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,977
You weren't.

339
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,008
What about her money?

340
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,509
The Dykeman Trust isn't
as solid as one would hope.

341
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,610
A lot of loans were taken
out by the president...

342
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,655
and recipient... Daddy.

343
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,282
Really? For what?

344
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,255
I asked Dunham
if there was a woman.

345
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:10,194
He said no.

346
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:12,698
It's all oysters, travel,
and club memberships.

347
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,430
Does she know?

348
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:18,335
You want to tell her? Go ahead.

349
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,707
Everything's been taken care of.

350
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,276
Boys.

351
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,986
Father called you salt and pepper.

352
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,222
That's beautiful, Dot.

353
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,763
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:54,809
I made you a ham sandwich.

355
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,070
What is this?

356
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,237
Carlton and Francine are
coming over for cards.

357
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:01,577
Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that?

358
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,347
We haven't done it
since before Christmas.

359
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,321
And they keep inviting us,
and we never go.

360
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:12,291
- Can I play cards?
- I want to play.

361
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,329
I'm going to lie down for a minute.

362
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,022
I have the chenille bedspread on.

363
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,032
Pull it back or they'll see
the marks on your face

364
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,295
and know you were sleeping.

365
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:24,372
You can say hello to everyone,
then it's off to bed.

366
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,413
Muddled. That means smash it.

367
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,715
He'll be nicer on the second one.

368
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,547
You did a wonderful job on mine.

369
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:39,711
Thank you.

370
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,153
Go take Mommy and Francine's orders.

371
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:45,282
Bobby, that is your last one.

372
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,486
All right. Come on, go.

373
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,188
Watch TV.

374
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,597
They're growing like weeds.

375
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,601
That's true.

376
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,228
We have the Caruthers girl
over to baby-sit already.

377
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,398
Can you believe that?

378
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,907
I don't think we know her.

379
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,601
You'd remember.

380
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,008
Goes to lmmaculate Heart.

381
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:07,047
I've been out
of high school a long time,

382
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,378
but honestly, the way these girls dress,

383
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,076
and those uniforms.

384
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,819
Carlton.

385
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,754
What?

386
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,792
I'm enjoying this story so far,

387
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:21,385
but I have a feeling
it's not going to end well.

388
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:25,398
I think that Francine
brings her in to torture me.

389
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,765
I mean, everything I do
rubs her the wrong way.

390
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,735
I got rid of the apartment in the city.

391
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,433
I'm taking her to Nassau.

392
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,204
There was a pie
cooling in the windowsill,

393
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,643
and I'm not even
supposed to smell it?

394
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,305
It's Darkness at Noon.

395
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,316
- What do you want to hear?
- Now, come on.

396
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,249
Don't be like that.

397
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:47,821
Two Tom Collins.

398
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,357
Okay, you don't smash
the cherry on that.

399
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,891
Just plop it in at the end.

400
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,086
Try to keep it in the top of the glass.

401
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:55,685
Gin.

402
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,317
Oh, good, you didn't wait.

403
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,918
We couldn't. It's late.

404
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,156
Work.

405
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,630
Your hair looks nice.

406
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:32,791
It does,

407
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,301
and she fought with Mr. Pierre
every minute of it.

408
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,064
He's got some funny ideas.

409
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:41,642
You want something to eat?

410
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,608
No, thank you. I already ate.

411
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,314
Connie Griffin was in her yard,

412
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,713
hanging laundry in Bergen Beach.

413
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,683
She saw the whole thing.

414
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,219
Can you imagine?

415
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:55,812
WOR said there were
sharks eating the victims.

416
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:57,915
That's worth reporting.

417
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,459
You want toast?

418
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,051
Mama, I already ate.

419
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,323
You say you're coming to dinner,
and you already ate?

420
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,968
I came because I wanted to see you.

421
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,535
We never see you.

422
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:13,569
I'm here. Right now.

423
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,006
Such a pretty face.

424
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:23,847
Gladys Rhine was asking for you at church.

425
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:26,011
Babe saw your brassiere ads
in the newspaper.

426
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:29,613
You should see poor Donny.
His skin is horrible.

427
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,316
Clearasil.

428
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,360
- He's beyond that.
- It's a shame.

429
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,985
He's a handsome boy.

430
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,225
Lots of people was
asking me about you.

431
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,895
Doesn't mean the same thing
to me that it means to you.

432
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:48,467
I think your father would like it
if you lit a candle for him.

433
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,683
I pray for you.

434
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,791
You know she lies and tells people
you're out of town on business.

435
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,557
She has some made-up church
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

436
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,359
where you go to mass with a friend of hers.

437
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,661
No one asked her to lie.

438
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:16,464
She's not going to be here forever.

439
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,308
Would it kill you to go?

440
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,238
I don't want to.

441
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:26,677
And I'm capable of making
my own decisions.

442
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:29,341
Really? State of New York
didn't think so.

443
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,248
The doctors didn't think so.

444
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:35,383
Did you bring the vacuum?

445
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,787
Yes.

446
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,691
Did you empty the bag?

447
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:41,159
Yes.

448
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,336
How do you let her get away
with making a bid of 150?

449
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:51,997
She usually overbids.
How was I supposed to know?

450
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,735
I do not overbid. I'm cautious.

451
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:57,812
I hear it's going to be
a row of apartments

452
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,470
all up Cedar Lane.

453
00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:01,845
No more cedars.

454
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:05,281
No parking around the school.

455
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:08,651
You know, I could've had
that property for a song?

456
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,951
A song and a half, tops.

457
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:13,084
I thought he was crazy,
but there you go.

458
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:20,591
I'm sure we have
something else to talk about.

459
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,403
Did you hear about that jetliner?

460
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,975
Terrible. It's terrible.

461
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,839
I was supposed to fly to Cleveland.

462
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:32,538
Now I can't. I have to take the train.

463
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:34,877
Nine hours.

464
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,247
You have got to be kidding.

465
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:38,819
Sorry.

466
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:43,916
I love the train. You do, too.

467
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,394
Bobby.

468
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:49,856
Go back to bed.

469
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:53,734
I'm scared. I heard something.

470
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:56,235
Everything's great. Go back to bed.

471
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,732
Bobby.

472
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:04,972
Come on.

473
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,273
Do what your mother says.

474
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,115
When I was a child,

475
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,743
I would've been way more
afraid of my father

476
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:13,980
than of going to sleep.

477
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:16,249
I hated going to sleep
when I was a kid.

478
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,848
But I bet you did when you were told.

479
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,621
With a stack of comics and a flashlight.

480
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:23,060
I don't care what they do
when they're up there.

481
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,257
I just like a few hours of quiet.

482
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,300
Ernie tests my patience.

483
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:33,167
Said he saw a ghost.

484
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,633
He was scared.

485
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:38,678
He's a little liar.

486
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:41,609
He is?

487
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:45,812
He drew the most amazing picture
of George Washington the other day.

488
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,353
His teacher was so impressed,

489
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:49,252
she put it up in the hallway.

490
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,257
It really looked like him.

491
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,122
Well, obviously.

492
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,525
Because he brought it home,

493
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,995
and I noticed the exact same
image of Washington

494
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:59,362
on the cover of one of his books.

495
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,764
He had traced it.

496
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,234
What happened?

497
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:04,601
He brought a book to school
so he could trace it?

498
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,504
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they had it there.

499
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,270
I mean, the point is it was dishonest.

500
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,938
My whole art department
is run on tracing paper.

501
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,412
Why reinvent the wheel?

502
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,282
I've got the rest.

503
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,216
I don't care about tracing.

504
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:24,120
What about all
that praise he accepted

505
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,489
for something he didn't do?

506
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:29,154
Well, the book says they
start fibbing at this age.

507
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:31,994
They want to see if they
can make it come true.

508
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,398
I don't need a book
to know what little boys do.

509
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:42,276
You have anything you want me
to take back to the library?

510
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,776
Anything you want me to pick up?

511
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:48,508
No. I have to renew
The Agony and the Ecstasy.

512
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:50,083
It's taking forever.

513
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:52,379
I should go. I have to work tomorrow.

514
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:53,977
Busy bee.

515
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:57,784
Aren't you going to say good night?

516
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:24,616
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

517
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,432
Marilyn says Helen Bishop's
trying to stop them

518
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:42,094
from putting parking meters
at Depot Plaza.

519
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:45,229
Apparently, she got chummy
with some administrator at the high school.

520
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,739
Big, fat fellow.

521
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,341
Carlton's put on a few.

522
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,913
I think it's nice he's filled out.

523
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,379
It shows he's happy.

524
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:56,913
I wouldn't say that.

525
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,812
Why not?

526
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,583
Did he say something?
What did he say?

527
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,419
He didn't say anything.

528
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,422
Well, he should be happy.

529
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,894
Okay, maybe he is.

530
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,399
He should be happy and grateful
and showering Francine with love

531
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,798
after what he put her through.

532
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:17,837
Look, Bets, I'm not going to fight.

533
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,940
I'll say whatever
you think I should say,

534
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,239
but I'm not going to fight with you.

535
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,030
What, sweetheart?

536
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:22,500
You laughed. What's funny?

537
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:24,960
I just...

538
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,003
I was just thinking that the last
conversation I had with him,

539
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:32,602
we were arguing about
whether Barney Kellogg

540
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:37,343
bred Boston terriers
or French bulldogs.

541
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,885
I'm sorry you were arguing.

542
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:43,286
Those ugly little pushed-in faces.

543
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:45,222
The labored breathing.

544
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:49,220
He said they were French bulldogs.

545
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,958
I said they were Boston terriers.

546
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,899
He was angry about it.

547
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:58,802
Oh, Peter, neither of you
knew it was the last time.

548
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:03,103
Fighting about facts, my mother calls it.

549
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,076
We do it all the time.

550
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:08,945
Argue over something
that's actually one thing or another.

551
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,349
What do Barney's dogs look like?

552
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,682
Just beige.

553
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,021
Kind of like pugs, but with big ears.

554
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,424
Those are French bulldogs.

555
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,960
Really?

556
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,904
When I woke up, I felt fine for a minute.

557
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,475
Then I remembered.

558
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,479
You should be thinking
about the good times.

559
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:44,678
Right.

560
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,279
So they go out a third time,

561
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,823
and now the restaurant's
even worse... Indian food.

562
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,688
But she really likes him.

563
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:55,023
I told you he worked
for City Hall, for the Mayor.

564
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:57,359
- So what happened?
- I need three copies.

565
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:00,093
One goes to Mr. Robinson,
one to Mr. Fairbanks,

566
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,498
and one to Mr. Smith.

567
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:02,728
The strange one.

568
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,327
That doesn't narrow it down.

569
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:06,372
Thank you.

570
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:07,771
Mr. Kinsey.

571
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,570
Is something wrong?

572
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,771
I'm avoiding you.

573
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,315
Or haven't you noticed that
after three days?

574
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:17,884
Are you worried
about the typewriter?

575
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:19,384
I'm not going to tell anyone.

576
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,478
Although you were so brazen,

577
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,352
you don't deserve clemency.

578
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,153
What did you say to Sheila?

579
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:29,456
- Who?
- Sheila.

580
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:30,861
My girlfriend.

581
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:32,694
Describe her to me.

582
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,324
Very funny.

583
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:36,562
I know what's first on the list.

584
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:40,434
Oh, my God, I knew
you were a lot of things...

585
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,099
I'm not a phony.

586
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,472
You're so proud.

587
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:46,103
It's so obvious why you're seeing her.

588
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,478
A supermarket checkout girl?

589
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,847
Conversation must be stimulating.

590
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:52,249
Lettuce costs a nickel.

591
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,651
What a relief. You're just jealous.

592
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:56,723
Because you're the one who got away?

593
00:32:56,824 --> 00:33:00,885
You, out there in your
poor-little-rich-boy apartment

594
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:03,259
in Newark or wherever.

595
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:06,697
Walking around with your pipe
and your beard,

596
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,063
falling in love with that girl

597
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,535
just to show how interesting you are.

598
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,905
Go ahead. What part is wrong?

599
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,557
Pete?

600
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:35,925
Duck. Come in.

601
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,793
Where's the girl?

602
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,334
She's supposed to tell me
if she goes anywhere.

603
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:49,638
When my old man died,
I went on a hell of a bender.

604
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,776
You heard about that.

605
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,973
I had to read about it
in the Times.

606
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:57,482
I wish you felt that you
could talk to me about it.

607
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,110
You should be able to.
We're practically family here.

608
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,050
I don't know, Duck.

609
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,592
There's not a lot to say.

610
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,595
No. Of course not.

611
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,529
Your old man was in advertising, right?

612
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,796
Boston.

613
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:19,600
Used to talk about the '20s
like we're idiots.

614
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,968
My father wasn't.

615
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,442
Of course, it turns out

616
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,274
I really didn't know
anything about him

617
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,712
except that he did not
like advertising.

618
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,081
Ah, that's his style.
I'm sure he was proud of you.

619
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,381
Some people have trouble saying it.

620
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:38,490
Yes. That was a problem for him.

621
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:40,685
What's not to be proud of?

622
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:42,524
You pay attention. You're hungry.

623
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,427
Most of the time you know
what you're doing.

624
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,726
I've noticed that.

625
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:49,861
I appreciate that.

626
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:55,805
Now, I don't want you to think
I'm being insensitive,

627
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,276
but we're going after American Airlines.

628
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:02,710
Well, it's...

629
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,580
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

630
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,619
Okay.

631
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:10,448
I'm meeting at the University Club
with Shel Keneally.

632
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:13,083
Tonight, actually.
Get everything rolling.

633
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,560
If anything, I'd like you on board.

634
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:18,154
I want you leading
the way on this thing.

635
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:24,336
I think I am uncomfortable.

636
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:29,441
I don't think I should do that.

637
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:31,773
It just happened.

638
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:39,380
I haven't even cried yet.

639
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:42,550
Of course.

640
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,584
It was inappropriate.

641
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,030
I'm sorry for your loss.

642
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:16,415
Can you come in here
with the papers I asked for?

643
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,392
Sweetheart.

644
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,329
You mind?

645
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,994
I need you to set a meeting.

646
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,698
A quiet place, but public.

647
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:37,435
Have a heart-to-heart
with Henry Lamont.

648
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:38,569
Why would I do that?

649
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,442
Because we're cutting him loose.

650
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:42,982
Duck's having a meeting
with Shel Keneally

651
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,209
from American Airlines tonight.

652
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:46,548
He's letting them know
that Mohawk is over.

653
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:47,882
And that gets us a pitch?

654
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,283
It sends a signal that we're serious.

655
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:53,223
And that we're willing
to do whatever it takes.

656
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,852
He has nothing.
And this is more of it.

657
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,294
- It's desperate.
- Come on.

658
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,798
You should be salivating to
rip these guys away from DDB.

659
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,198
And even if we don't
win this account,

660
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,464
we're going to be on a list
in the New York Times

661
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:05,869
of big boys pitching for this business.

662
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,702
We have an airline.

663
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,776
What kind of company
are we going to be?

664
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:13,408
The kind where everyone
has a summer house?

665
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:17,478
I can't believe I look like an idiot

666
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:18,779
for wanting to be loyal
to these people.

667
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,114
Take off your dress.

668
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,712
You get a chance
at American Airlines, you take it.

669
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,654
End of discussion.

670
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:45,541
Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone?

671
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:46,943
Of course.

672
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:49,873
Forget it.

673
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:09,465
Mr. Campbell.

674
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,697
Don. Do you have a minute?

675
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:14,171
What do you want, Campbell?

676
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,773
I just was... I don't know.

677
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,403
It's not a good time.

678
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,951
If you want, you can
leave him a note.

679
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,785
People do that.

680
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,085
No.

681
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,759
Thank you.

682
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:56,313
Good night, Joan.

683
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,230
Did you see who did this?

684
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,763
No.

685
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,166
I never would have guessed
you were in your 30s.

686
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,208
People should not bring
their personal problems

687
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:23,435
into the office.

688
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:25,670
I agree.

689
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:27,872
Is it so hard to just leave
everything at the door

690
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,006
and just do your job?

691
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:32,379
I look forward to it.

692
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:34,681
They can't stand it.

693
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:37,518
They'll drag you into
the garbage out there.

694
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,117
They just want you to be
as miserable as they are.

695
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:43,719
I say let them have it.

696
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:04,374
Thanks.

697
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,544
How are you, Don?

698
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:08,816
Henry.

699
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:10,150
Sit down.

700
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:12,418
Can I get you anything?

701
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:15,324
You know, I'm glad you picked this place.

702
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,420
It reminds me of Pearl Harbor.

703
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,763
For many reasons.

704
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:26,965
Do you think you're not
going to have to say it?

705
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,975
Sterling Cooper has decided

706
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,478
to end its relationship
with Mohawk Airlines.

707
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,571
Sterling Cooper.

708
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm sorry.

709
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,081
It wasn't my decision.

710
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,913
You know, when we came in there,

711
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,184
they all said Sterling Cooper
is Don Draper.

712
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,759
That's what you get.

713
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,926
That talk you gave me
about us growing together.

714
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,002
You said Sterling Cooper
didn't need a big airline.

715
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:59,163
You were going
to make us a big airline.

716
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,935
I wish things hadn't
worked out this way.

717
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,044
I'm almost embarrassed to say this.

718
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,682
You fooled me.

719
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,997
Stockholders weren't remotely impressed
with firing our head of ops.

720
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:35,508
So this agency change,
well, that's going to be a process.

721
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,176
And to be part of that process?

722
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:40,644
- Listen, we're here talking, right?
- Of course.

723
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,511
But it's hard for me
to leave here comfortable

724
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:43,947
unless I know what
your objections are.

725
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,519
Well, we're a few steps
away from objections.

726
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,315
We're just sticking a toe in the water.

727
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,152
Well, we're not. We jumped in.

728
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:56,225
Pete.

729
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:59,429
It's good to see you.

730
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:03,936
Shel, this is Pete Campbell.

731
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:05,265
I don't think he's our best.

732
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:06,862
I think he's the best.

733
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:11,174
Pleased to meet you.

734
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,540
You as well.

735
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:18,207
I was just telling my buddy Shel here

736
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:20,343
how we've really cleared
the way to be in this.

737
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,590
I was telling Duck here
we don't know where we are yet.

738
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:30,457
I don't think you're aware

739
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,464
of the level of commitment
and enthusiasm

740
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:33,863
for this project at Sterling Cooper.

741
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,093
It's true.

742
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:36,567
We've got writers bucking the gate.

743
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,638
I've already got a stack
of ideas on my desk

744
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,104
that I think you'd love to see.

745
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:47,437
We understand how delicate

746
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:50,346
the process of rebuilding
the public's confidence will be.

747
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,112
Not just the public. Our stockholders.

748
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:56,453
Well, I want you to know that,

749
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:58,616
should you decide
to bring us your business,

750
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:00,590
there will be someone
on your account

751
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:02,423
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

752
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,997
My father was on that plane.

753
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:15,168
My goodness.

754
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:18,870
Sorry to hear that.

755
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:21,174
Yes. Well...

756
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,250
it's a horrible thing.

757
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,979
Hopefully, something good
will come of it.

758
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:30,248
That is something I will pass on.

759
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:36,919
Shall we grab a bite?

760
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,292
I put our name in.

761
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:24,907
I'm not your waitress,
but are you all set here?

762
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,474
Excuse me?

763
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,178
You've been sitting alone a long time.

764
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:34,811
Can I get you a menu?

765
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,986
I don't think so.

766
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,757
I have to drop this off,

767
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:45,593
but I can swing back
around on my way out.

768
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,394
Not tonight.

769
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,036
Would you hold him for me?

770
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:41,842
Thanks.
