1
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,500
Kids, time to go!

2
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,419
Coming, Carla.

3
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,473
And I said I liked her name.

4
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,225
Cocoa's a nice name. Isn't it?

5
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,810
Yes. It is.

6
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,022
Come on, Bobby. Let's go.

7
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,655
All right. Let's go.

8
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,120
Good morning.

9
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,789
- Peggy.
- Good morning, Don.

10
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,207
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,333
Hollis.

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,005
You hear about Marilyn? Poor thing.

13
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,674
It's very upsetting.

14
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,218
I can't say I'm surprised.

15
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,887
The few things I know about her.

16
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,139
You just don't imagine her
ever being alone.

17
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,557
She was so famous.

18
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,143
Some people just hide in plain sight.

19
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:29,732
My mother and sister keep calling.

20
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,568
Suicide is disturbing.

21
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,321
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,288
We're lucky Playtex didn't go
for that Jackie/Marilyn campaign.

23
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,415
We'd have to pull everything indefinitely.

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, that's true.

25
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,013
I've never taken pills,
even when I had a headache.

26
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,188
Mr. Draper, good morning.

27
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,439
Would you like coffee?

28
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,732
I already had some.

29
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,485
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

30
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,778
Do you need to go home?

31
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,281
No. Of course not.

32
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,372
I have Warren, and I have Todd.

33
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,541
Todd is a mail boy.
Why do you have him?

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,084
I'm paying him.

35
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,253
I'm sorry.
I don't understand this stupid blood drive.

36
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,130
You just hate that Media wins every year.

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,549
Wins what? How do you win a blood drive?
What do you win?

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,635
I don't know.
You're the best or something.

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,929
I'll be lucky if Accounts
can get eight people.

40
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,472
Well, Campbell's afraid of needles,

41
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,807
Duck doesn't give two craps.

42
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,726
Good morning.

43
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,977
Good morning, fellas.

44
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,520
Is this program already in progress?

45
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,064
We're expecting our most
successful blood drive ever.

46
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,358
Yes. Tell me everything.

47
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,027
I think we're very organized.

48
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,653
Creative, our department,

49
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,573
will be at 75 to 80%  participation.

50
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,491
Of course, I'm assuming you are in.

51
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,701
I am.

52
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,121
Do Kurt and Smitty count as one person?

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,998
Why don't you bore me with the details?

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,167
We're gonna take the lockers
out of the break room,

55
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,668
put 'em in the hallway in the morning.

56
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,670
There will be two litters, three nurses,

57
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,964
at least one old lady serving refreshments,
and pIenty of chairs.

58
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,675
Kinsey, I want you to pull
every intern and Iackey--

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,636
switchboard, elevator men.

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,638
Find out who wants to be
a copywriter for the day.

61
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,722
DoIlar a head.

62
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,890
That's not fair.

63
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,268
You're in Accounts.
You should have thought of it.

64
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,728
Just to be clear,

65
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,690
do I get the dollar for each person I get,

66
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,275
or do they get it for giving blood?

67
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,777
The people giving blood.

68
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,904
This is for mankind, Kinsey.

69
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,740
That's the money they'd make
actually being in the art department.

70
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,241
So what is the prize?

71
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,993
Helping another human being.

72
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,995
Also, there will be women fainting.

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,580
I'd think you'd like that.

74
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,708
If this was a flat-out athletic competition,

75
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,919
Accounts would win,
without a doubt.

76
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,420
What an elegant surrender.

77
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,880
And put up more posters.

78
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,632
I can't believe I have to say that
to you people.

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,509
Apparently, if we get 1 00%  participation,

80
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,094
which Media will do its best to aid,

81
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,762
they're going to put us in the Times.

82
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,263
I booked a photographer, just in case.

83
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,765
Good.

84
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,934
NBC's having the Mitch Miller
concert on Thursday.

85
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,186
Any chance I could show
you and Mrs. Draper off?

86
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,354
We'd love to, but--

87
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,232
. . .my kid is sick.

88
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,150
You'll know what that means soon enough.

89
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,570
Shot down.

90
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,709
That was quick.

91
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,754
What do we have today?

92
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:24,008
The 1 0:00 with Miss Holloway
to go over traffic for new business,

93
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,719
4:00 with Ron Venincasa
from Ace Hardware,

94
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,014
and Mr. Sterling moved the meeting
with Boston Edison to 5.

95
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,475
I assume to have it bleed
into the cocktail hour.

96
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,895
May I?

97
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,239
There was a bit of confusion last night.

98
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,366
I think I made a terrible mistake.

99
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,327
What happened?

100
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,953
Your daughter called and asked

101
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,830
when you would be back
from your business trip

102
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,249
because her mother wasn't sure.

103
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,049
You don't have to tell me anything,
but I didn't know what to say.

104
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,886
I said Wednesday.
I know I should have said I don't know.

105
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,223
Mrs. Draper is working out some things.

106
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,058
I understand.

107
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,851
I'm sure it won't come up again.

108
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,104
I thought it would be over by now,

109
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,147
I guess, and there'd be no need to--

110
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,234
I'm sorry about that.

111
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,071
It goes without saying that this is personal,

112
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,115
and I'd appreciate your keeping it that way.

113
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,908
Of course.

114
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,161
I'd also avoid giving me concerned looks.

115
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,414
Mr. Draper, I hope you've noticed
I'm a discreet person.

116
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,707
I don't know you at all,

117
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,917
and this is personal,

118
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,502
and it's not up for discussion.

119
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,714
Of course.

120
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,925
If you need anything,
I'm right out there.

121
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,266
I'm at the Roosevelt
if there's an emergency.

122
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,247
In an interview just weeks before her death,

123
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,833
Miss Monroe angrily protested to a reporter

124
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,751
about attacks on stars.

125
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,421
"We're what's okay with
the movie business," she said.

126
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,840
"Management is what's
wrong with the business."

127
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,157
Mr. Campbell, Miss Olson,
and Mr. Romano are here.

128
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,658
Send them in.

129
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,539
My oldest just turned 30,

130
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,374
and she's had a string of bad beaux.

131
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,335
It's very upsetting.

132
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,878
Can I get you kids anything?

133
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,588
- I'm fine.
- I'll have something.

134
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,548
They're probably walking over.

135
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,050
Dress rehearsal, Freddie.

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,844
I'll do introductions.

137
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,512
Jeff Hartung's wife just had a baby.

138
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,348
Boy or girl?

139
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,183
That's good.

140
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,851
Then I talk about Volkswagen.

141
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,020
No. Don said we only
bring up Volkswagen

142
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,563
if they don't like what we've presented.

143
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,148
Okay. Then I throw it to you, Freddie.

144
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,608
Thank you, Freddie.

145
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,906
"I just got a brand-new
Samsonite Silhouette,

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,115
"and I hate it.

147
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,325
"Don't get me wrong.

148
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,327
"I love the shape, the size, the color,

149
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,163
"and I love the Silhouette
because it's a Samsonite,

150
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,707
so I know we're gonna go
lots of places together,"

151
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,376
see lots of things,

152
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,628
collect a lifetime of memories.

153
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,714
I hate my Silhouette because it's empty.

154
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,966
Then Sal.

155
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,220
Shouldn't the artwork come first?

156
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,264
What about unveiIing it?

157
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,057
You know how excited they get.

158
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,645
Freddie?

159
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,277
What the hell, Freddie?

160
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,736
What--

161
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,446
What were we talking about?

162
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,240
Two types of travelers.

163
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,953
Freddie, do you have
another pair of trousers here?

164
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,998
Why?

165
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:29,628
Jesus.

166
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,049
I'll fix this.

167
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,844
I'm gonna-- I need a minute.

168
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,347
I gotta think.

169
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,398
Freddie?

170
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,529
Is he dead?

171
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,450
No, he's not dead. He passed out.

172
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,244
He's fine.

173
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,997
The Hartungs are at reception.

174
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,376
We'll be right there. Thanks, Abigail.

175
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,504
He can't leave this room.

176
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,507
They're all from Colorado.

177
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,385
I guess I could push it until tomorrow,

178
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,305
book them another night at the Carlyle.

179
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,806
Should I just cancel it?

180
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,308
I should talk to Don.

181
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,517
That's not necessary.
I can handle this.

182
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,769
Fine.

183
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,104
Jesus. It's a suitcase.

184
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,357
Peggy, you can do it, right?

185
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,108
You think it's gonna be better tomorrow?

186
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,651
Shit.

187
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,362
It'll be fine.

188
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,323
We'll tell them Freddie's sick. It's true.

189
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,117
I'll go to reception.
You two go to the conference room

190
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,370
and act like you've been waiting,
but don't look mad.

191
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,163
Someone telI Freddie's girl it's cancelled.

192
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,831
I don't want him wandering in.

193
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,835
It's disgusting.

194
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,837
There's no need for that.

195
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,106
Can I speak to you for a minute?

196
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,578
Carla?

197
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,816
I forgot you were coming by.

198
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,317
Are you okay?

199
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,572
I haven't been feeling weIl.

200
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,198
Oh, no, Betty.

201
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,242
You and Don are still
coming tonight, l hope.

202
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,743
We'd love to.

203
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,704
I just don't think I'Il be up to it.

204
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,164
That ruins things.

205
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,917
Well, you wanted to borrow
the black chiffon, right?

206
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,002
Come upstairs.

207
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,211
Are you sure?

208
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,421
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to.

209
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,006
Raymond has to work these things.

210
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,555
And I got you out of bed?
I am so sorry.

211
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,432
Give me the black one, and I'll go.

212
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,516
Nonsense.

213
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,899
I think my waist is higher than yours.

214
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,776
What do you have that's generous?

215
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,236
I don't know.

216
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,532
How about this?

217
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,160
You'll look like sherbet.
Long white gloves.

218
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,579
I can't wear those after Gypsy.

219
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,707
Think you'll be better
by lunch on Thursday?

220
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,669
I'm looking forward to it.

221
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,048
This is youthful.

222
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,178
It doesn't matter. I'm invisible.

223
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,765
That's not true.

224
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,936
Raymond's sweet about it,
but he's so easy to please.

225
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,813
That's sweet.

226
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,649
It is.

227
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:23,278
I think, what did I do to deserve him?

228
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,405
Then I spend his money on Dr. Weinberg.

229
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,658
I got my diagnosis the other day.

230
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,034
I'm bored .

231
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,828
That's too bad.

232
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,498
I saw Arthur have a fight with Tara,

233
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,168
and I have been having
ridiculous dreams since.

234
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,920
I wish you'd come ride with us again.

235
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,380
It reaIly takes the pressure off.

236
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,383
Think you can carry this?

237
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,010
No, ma'am.

238
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,722
You shouldn't talk to him so much.

239
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,558
I know. It's embarrassing.

240
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,022
It's a switch you can flip
on and off, you know.

241
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,566
Really?

242
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,194
You don't even think about this, do you?

243
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,114
Don's perfect.

244
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,871
Can we talk at lunch?

245
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,832
I'm really not feeling well.

246
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,167
Take them all.

247
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,795
No. Just these two.

248
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,627
That's it for today.

249
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,403
Many's the time I've dreamed
of finding you like this.

250
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,280
What are you doing here?

251
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,074
You're right.

252
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,241
I'll just get all my beIongings,

253
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,451
- and I'lI leave.
- It's 4:30.

254
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,078
You're supposed to be
sitting in a bar somewhere

255
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,621
waiting for Boston Edison.

256
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,498
How often do you come in here?

257
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,501
Not that often.

258
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,716
What's wrong, Red?

259
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,009
Do you miss me?

260
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,222
She was so young.

261
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,767
Not you, too.

262
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,312
Yes, I'm just another frivolous secretary.

263
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,772
It's a terrible tragedy,

264
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,566
but that woman's a stranger.

265
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,318
Roosevelt--

266
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,320
I hated him, but I felt like I knew him.

267
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,656
A lot of peopIe felt like they knew her.

268
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,324
You should be sensitive to that.

269
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,411
Hey. You're not like her.

270
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,790
Physically, a little,

271
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,750
but don't tell me that makes you sad.

272
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,335
It's not a joke.

273
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,379
This worId destroyed her.

274
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,967
ReaIly? She was a movie star
who had everything and everybody,

275
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,719
and she threw it away.

276
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,558
But, hey, if you want to be sad.

277
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,687
One day you'll lose someone
who's important to you.

278
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,480
You'll see.

279
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,607
It's very painful.

280
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,543
Are you feeling better, Mommy?

281
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,588
Yes. I'll join you next time.

282
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,009
I'm surprised Daddy let you in the car.

283
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,888
You kids should go to bed .

284
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,557
Wash your face and brush your teeth.
I'll tuck you in.

285
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,311
Good night.

286
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,398
You just came back.

287
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,902
Now you're leaving again?

288
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,946
It'll go by like that.

289
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,157
Come here.

290
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,001
It won't be that long, Salamander.

291
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,670
Go.

292
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,263
Listen, she called my office.

293
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,892
She did? When?

294
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,102
Monday.

295
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,896
What do you want me to say?

296
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,440
I think she expected you
over the weekend.

297
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,611
You said you didn't want me here,
and then you do.

298
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,071
I didn't want them involved in this.

299
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,281
Obviously, that's impossible.

300
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,576
What do you want to do?

301
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,621
I mean, how Iong is this going to go on?

302
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,081
We have to tell them something.

303
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,165
Like what?

304
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,295
Okay. How about. . .

305
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,588
I'm working on an account.

306
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,006
They're putting me up in Philadelphia,

307
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,675
but I'lI be home every weekend.

308
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,677
Jesus. Did you just think that up?

309
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,263
Or I could just come home.

310
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,477
Bets, what do you want?

311
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,983
Listen, if your mind's made up,

312
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,484
I'm not gonna taIk you into it.

313
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,070
I thought you can talk
anyone into anything.

314
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,201
Good night.

315
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,219
Would you like coffee?

316
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,596
And a bear claw.

317
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,686
What's this?

318
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,981
I thought you could use
a few more shirts in your rotation.

319
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,696
Thank you. Submit your receipt.

320
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,699
Your correspondence is on your desk.

321
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,327
Let me get you breakfast.
I'lI be right back.

322
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,246
And Mr. Kinsey said
that l have to drag you,

323
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,915
if necessary, to the blood drive.

324
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,752
You're not a fainter, are you?

325
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,881
I don't faint, but I might cry after.

326
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,397
Peggy.

327
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,482
Hello, Freddie.

328
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,733
How'd it go yesterday?

329
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,610
I Ieft word with Abigail. They loved it.

330
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,236
Good. Good.

331
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,365
I was thinking about
letting you talk anyway.

332
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,371
I have to apologize
for putting you in that spot.

333
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,956
Freddie, it's over.

334
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,624
There's no reason to talk about it.

335
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,918
Of course.

336
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,836
Did they ask about me?

337
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,254
We told them you were sick.

338
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,757
That's good.

339
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,301
So on Monday,
when they get back to Colorado,

340
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,470
I'll give them a caIl and sew things up.

341
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,013
That's a great idea.

342
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,291
Bobby.

343
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,169
Mrs. Draper. I'm sorry to bother you.

344
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,921
It's okay, Carla.

345
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,591
It's a beautiful day.

346
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,386
I'm going to take the children out again.
ls that good?

347
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,180
Whatever they want.

348
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,601
Can I do anything for you?

349
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,311
If you want, I can draw a bath.

350
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,355
No, thank you.

351
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,156
I've been married
almost 20 years, you know.

352
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,701
I really don't want to talk about this.

353
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,913
I'm sorry.

354
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,500
Carla. . . .

355
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,337
I haven't been sleeping very well.

356
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,131
You know what helps?

357
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,341
Splash cold water
on your face and go outside.

358
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,844
You'lI notice things
are right where you left them.

359
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,238
I'm usually part of the meeting
before the meeting.

360
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,115
Relax, Don. Sit down.

361
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,659
This is all being done in the right way.

362
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,790
Campbell.

363
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,504
Well, Don, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

364
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,548
We were on the launch pad
yesterday for Samsonite,

365
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,967
and Freddie Rumsen pissed his pants.

366
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,345
What?

367
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,721
He's not talking about nerves here.

368
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,224
He's taIking about a wet pair of pants.

369
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,185
Really?

370
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,229
How'd the presentation go?

371
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,523
Don, it's conduct unbefitting.

372
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,108
Of Freddie Rumsen?

373
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,068
We're lucky Campbell here
grabbed the controls.

374
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,278
He locked Rumsen up
and threw Peggy OIson in.

375
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,863
We're lucky the bench is deep.

376
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,741
We have to cut him loose.

377
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,827
Is that necessary?

378
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,370
The man is a train wreck.

379
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,581
We at least need to get him
off this account.

380
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,291
They called already.
They're thrilled with Peggy.

381
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,418
No. I don't want him
on any of my accounts.

382
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,087
This could have happened in a meeting.

383
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,089
But it didn't.

384
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,885
That'll be all, boys.

385
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,054
Thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

386
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,144
We're not doing him any favors
keeping him around.

387
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,566
Duck's a teetotaler.

388
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,192
He's been gunning
for Freddie since day 1 .

389
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,652
He's got a point.

390
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,112
We can't even tell Cooper about this.

391
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,739
You know his whole thing with germs.

392
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,283
I don't think it's in my contract

393
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,118
that Duck can fire someone
in my department.

394
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,452
You don't have a contract.

395
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,205
And I can fire anyone I want to.

396
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,457
We really don't have a choice.

397
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,210
You can still get him to give blood.

398
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,296
The agencies will laugh about this,

399
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,091
but the clients,
they already think we're all like that.

400
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:16,514
We'll say it's a six-month leave of absence
so he can go for the cure.

401
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,475
He'll know what that means.

402
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,227
You don't want to throw him away.

403
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,065
Your loyalty is starting
to become a Iiability.

404
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,027
Let's do this before he finds out.

405
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,236
We don't need any more accidents.

406
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,905
Dinner tonight.

407
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,616
You need to call the missus?

408
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,075
I'll make it.

409
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,281
Mr. Case.

410
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,451
Betty.

411
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,661
How are you?

412
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,789
It's a beautiful day.

413
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,794
Have you just ridden,
or are you about to ride?

414
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,712
I can never tell whether
you're before or after.

415
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:30,880
I'm on my way out.

416
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,174
It's good to see you.

417
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,009
How are your children?

418
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,302
They're wonderful.

419
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,474
Have you seen Sara Beth lately?

420
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,101
I think so. Monday, maybe?

421
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,352
That's good news.

422
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,104
I'm glad she came.

423
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,897
Why?

424
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,774
Nothing.

425
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,609
I had noticed she seemed distracted.

426
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,153
I shouldn't have said anything.

427
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,531
Is there anything I can do?

428
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,118
No. But she'd be glad
to know you're concerned.

429
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,786
I think you make her feel better.

430
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,539
She talks about you a lot.

431
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,582
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

432
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,168
You know what?

433
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,796
The three of us should go to lunch
and have some fun.

434
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,214
It would cheer her up.

435
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,924
It's a great idea.

436
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,217
Thursday?

437
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,303
Café Soleil in Old Town.

438
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,387
1 :00.

439
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,680
I'll pick up the check.

440
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,848
See you then.

441
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,069
That was nothing.

442
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,946
I'm thinking of doing it again.

443
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,781
You should smoke a cigarette right now.

444
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,283
I know they said not to,

445
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,951
but I'm telling you,
my knees buckled.

446
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,079
I thought I was gonna perform
a full Freddie Rumsen.

447
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,831
Jesus.

448
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,418
Hello, Don. We're in the lead.

449
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,878
Turns out Hollis has a novel.

450
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,338
Good.

451
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,922
Too bad Freddie made
his donation yesterday.

452
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,300
He's a real wizz in advertising.

453
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,927
Jesus.

454
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,429
What are you doing?

455
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,972
What do you mean?

456
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,142
That's none of your business.

457
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,811
Freddie had a bad day.

458
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,521
Can't you find something else to do

459
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,066
besides dining on the drama
of other people's lives

460
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,692
like a bunch of teenage girls?

461
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,280
Sorry, Don. It's funny.

462
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,908
Sure.

463
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,868
It's just a man's name, right?

464
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,337
Could you leave us alone for a moment?

465
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,257
Truth to tell, I was a little nervous.

466
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,426
I'd never given one of those
funny speeches before

467
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,678
where you say what you don't mean.

468
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,555
Freddie, we've reached a decision.

469
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,392
You're gonna take
a six-month leave of absence.

470
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,353
Is that necessary?

471
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,313
The door wiIl be open.

472
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,357
It was a snafu.

473
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,651
Isn't the embarrassment enough?

474
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,112
Full salary. You dry out, come back,

475
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,446
we'll see where we are.

476
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,951
Clients love me. I keep up with them.

477
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,661
We have laughs.

478
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,246
Monday morning, I'll be good as new.

479
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,330
I promise.

480
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,624
There's a line, Freddie,

481
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,334
and you wet it.

482
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,212
You see? We're laughing about it.

483
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,047
What's the big deal?

484
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,842
You remember Bob Peebles?
How mean he was?

485
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,261
He fired his secretary,

486
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,430
and he threw all her things
out the window,

487
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,597
including her keys.

488
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,307
That was good for morale.

489
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,147
What is this about?

490
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,566
Duck PhiIlips?

491
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,151
He's as dry as a bone.

492
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,819
He doesn't understand this business.

493
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,113
Freddie, my father would
have fired you for this.

494
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,450
Your father drank more
than the two of you put together.

495
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,578
He used to come in
with his shirt on inside-out.

496
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,413
He admired you.

497
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,207
I , however, had different
feelings at the time.

498
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,042
When we first met,

499
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,170
Bonny Prince Sterling here
thought I was a coward

500
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,796
because I was in the Signal Corps.

501
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,674
I didn't know it was only
for his last six months.

502
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,884
I thought he was a typist.

503
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,760
Turns out before that,

504
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,554
he was in charge of killing people--

505
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,055
and by people, I mean Germans.

506
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,557
It was a long time ago.

507
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,892
Come on. Be proud.

508
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,393
What was it? Like 1 5 of them.

509
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,604
That's impressive.

510
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:20,401
Look, l can be completely in control.

511
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,236
My podiatrist went to Hazleton.

512
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,655
Came back a new man with great stories.

513
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,282
Only drinks beer now.

514
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,706
It's the best thing, Freddie.

515
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:40,963
Well, I guess you get dealt
the hand you get dealt, right?

516
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,676
I can pull myself together.

517
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,346
I got a great book.

518
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,392
Maybe l'll head to PhilIy or Boston.

519
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,603
They're all dying to do what we do here.

520
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,939
You know l'll recommend you.

521
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,066
Fantastic. So this couId be good.

522
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,318
There's a lot of great towns.

523
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,113
My father sold greeting cards.

524
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,949
He used to come into the kitchen,

525
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,825
unroll this map on the table,

526
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,245
and put a finger on a spot
and say something like,

527
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:15,248
"Memphis. Who wants
to live in Memphis?"

528
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,707
I'd say, "Not me."

529
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,001
We had only been in Springfield
for nine months.

530
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,714
Meanwhile, here we are.

531
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,132
To New York.

532
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,552
Come on. Let's make a night of it.

533
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,179
Really?

534
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,764
AbsoluteIy.

535
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,977
To Monday morning.

536
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,229
It'll be here faster than you think.

537
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,399
Hold off on the menus.

538
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,192
We're going to take another lap first.

539
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,777
Bring some bread.

540
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,243
Give me 5 bucks.

541
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,953
No. Sorry. Don.

542
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,834
Can I help you gentlemen?

543
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,544
Swordfish.

544
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,338
And who are you here to see?

545
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,048
You can't do that now.

546
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,592
I just gave you the money.

547
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,802
Come on. Do we look like cops?

548
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,596
Sir?

549
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,308
I have a very good friend--

550
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,059
I can't remember the guy's name.

551
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,312
How about if I give you our names?

552
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,563
I'm Dick Dollars,

553
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,273
this is Mike Moneybags,

554
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,858
and this--

555
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,067
Tilden Katz.

556
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,948
Fine.

557
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,700
Here.

558
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,826
That's a 20.

559
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,788
Gentlemen.

560
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,350
Is it Milwaukee?

561
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,434
Yes, it is.

562
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,894
Son of a bitch.

563
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,830
The Chuck-a-luck.

564
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,383
Going to need some cocktails.

565
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,637
Hey, isn't that the champ back there?

566
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,306
For another couple of months.

567
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,391
You're crazy.

568
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,476
Nobody's gonna beat him.

569
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,021
Hey, loosen up.

570
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,856
Everything's gonna be okay.

571
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,443
Just in time.

572
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,280
Canadian Club neat,
Wolfschmidt Gibson,

573
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,990
Granddad rocks.

574
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,828
Pete Campbell.

575
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,372
I would have never thought
I was in his way.

576
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,795
You know, you bet badly.

577
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,046
Obviously.

578
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,506
No. I mean you win a few times,

579
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,174
you got to start really putting it out there.

580
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,592
You kept betting the same thing.

581
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,803
You're so good at this,
why don't you quit your job?

582
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,851
See? He's having a great time.

583
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,856
Hello, there.

584
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,692
Are we winners or losers?

585
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,238
Losers tonight,
but winners in general.

586
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,616
You know, BBDO hired a colored kid.

587
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,702
What do you think of that?

588
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,620
I think I'm glad I'm not that kid.

589
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,253
I'm sorry.
Can we get you a drink or something?

590
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,379
No.

591
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,220
I'm sorry. Were you interested?

592
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,055
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

593
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,391
I know what's going on.

594
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,351
You come in too early.

595
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,061
You got dry cleaning
moving in and out.

596
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,772
I can't remember the Iast time it was

597
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,064
you went out spur of the moment.

598
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,567
Send off Freddie,
I had to send off Freddie.

599
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,818
Come on.

600
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,738
I've been in your particular situation.

601
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,656
I heard you chaired the blood drive.

602
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,116
Where are you, the Stanhope?

603
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,284
The Biltmore?

604
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,369
- Roger.
- Did she kick you out? You leave?

605
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,579
There's nothing to talk about.

606
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,539
Look, people make mistakes.

607
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,750
You feel bad about it.
You think things over,

608
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,253
and in the end,
you do the grand gesture for her.

609
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,464
It'll be easy for you . You're creative.

610
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,924
Roger, will you stop?

611
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,092
All I'm gonna say is
do you want to be right,

612
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,427
or do you want to be married?

613
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,971
I know marriage isn't a natural state,
but you do it.

614
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,097
Why?

615
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,849
I don't know.

616
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,144
The kids.

617
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,562
Again!

618
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,274
And don't fool yourself.
There are other things.

619
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,193
Think about when you met her.

620
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,781
Okay. I'm sorry.

621
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,825
You're so secretive.

622
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,952
Hey, Don.

623
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,038
Look who's here.

624
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,165
If it isn't the man
in the gray flannel suit.

625
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,549
What the hell was that for?

626
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,969
We're gonna go.

627
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,303
Don't worry about it.

628
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,306
I'm sure it's not the first time
he's been punched in the face.

629
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,019
Hey, Floyd.

630
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,981
How'd I do?

631
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,156
I'm sure there are 20 people
who want to thank you for that.

632
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,158
It wasn't exactly a fair match-up.

633
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,744
I think that's gonna do it for me.

634
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,496
Yeah. Me, too.

635
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,915
It's getting late.

636
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,209
- This was a nice evening.
- Hold on.

637
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,879
Don and I are going to the East Side.
You take it.

638
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,214
AbsoluteIy.

639
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,391
l'd like to stay and get
all sentimental with you,

640
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,353
but l got to go and give
a Chinaman a music lesson.

641
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,481
Want to watch how I do it,
unzipping the fly and everything?

642
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,233
Yeah. Go to heIl.

643
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,277
Take him to McCann.

644
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,868
This was fun.

645
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,952
Good.

646
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,705
I'm gonna miss you.

647
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,956
You're talented.

648
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,960
I don't know.

649
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,046
Thank you, Freddie.

650
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,006
It means a lot.

651
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,926
What am l gonna do?

652
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,761
What am l going to tell Violet?

653
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,182
I don't know.
It sounded like you had a plan.

654
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,353
I'm not kidding, Don.

655
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,104
What am l gonna do?

656
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,399
It's not an ending.

657
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,776
It's a fresh start.

658
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,740
If I don't go into that office every day,

659
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,325
who am I?

660
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,998
Where do you live, Freddie?

661
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,919
1 52 Riverside Drive.

662
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,296
Apartment 604.

663
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,551
No matter what he says,
take him there.

664
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,725
Good night, Freddie.

665
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,062
Good-bye, Don.

666
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,164
See, I find if I stick
with the clear liquors--

667
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,542
vodka, gin-- I know where I stand.

668
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,712
I'm the opposite.

669
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,382
So what do you think,
because you gave blood,

670
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,342
the whiskey made you a little angry?

671
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,221
That was a real
Archibald Whitman maneuver.

672
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,431
Who's that?

673
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,474
This hothead drunk I used to know.

674
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,352
Jimmy Barrett's a weaseI. Enjoy.

675
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,193
So what's going on with you?

676
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,741
I'm at the Roosevelt.

677
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,326
See? That wasn't so hard.

678
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,328
I really don't want to discuss it, Roger.

679
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,998
Why? Because you feel so bad?
l've been there.

680
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,086
No, I don't feel bad at all.

681
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,382
I mean, sometimes.

682
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,387
Mostly, I'm just relieved.

683
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,597
Really?

684
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,684
Did you falI in love?

685
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,604
No.

686
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,857
That'd be easier.

687
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,484
Then I'd know what to do.

688
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,360
Easier--

689
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,863
There's some incredible woman,

690
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,033
and someone's gonna end up with her,
but it can't be you.

691
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,326
Why not?

692
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,538
'Cause we're married.

693
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,007
I don't know.

694
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,217
It's your life.

695
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,553
You don't know how long it's gonna be,

696
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,305
but you know it's got a bad ending.

697
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,934
You have to move forward.

698
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,687
As soon as you can
figure out what that is.

699
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,440
Two coronaries.

700
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,327
Gotta move forward.

701
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,289
It's your life.

702
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,044
I mean, this can't be it, right?

703
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,133
We're in it together.

704
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,644
That's true.

705
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,277
You wanted to see me?

706
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,195
Close the door.

707
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,042
That was quite a presentation you gave.

708
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,670
The Samsonite people are thrilled.

709
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,755
That's good to hear.

710
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,510
They've requested that you be reassigned
as the copywriter on their account.

711
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,346
What about Freddie?

712
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,807
Freddie's decided
to take a few months off.

713
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:01,310
He did? When's he coming back?

714
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,145
It doesn't matter.

715
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,647
You'll be taking over all of his business.

716
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,485
Are you sure?

717
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,112
You know, I really don't like

718
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,240
walking into an ambush
from Duck and Pete Campbell.

719
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,076
I don't know why anyone
had to know about that.

720
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,329
Even me?

721
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,413
No, of course you,

722
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,081
but. . .

723
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,374
I just thought that--

724
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,502
I Iove Freddie.

725
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,963
What's your point?

726
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,799
Don't feel bad about
being good at your job.

727
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,055
I wish it hadn't happened this way.

728
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,934
That's the way it happened.

729
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,604
Congratulations.

730
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,383
- Miss Olson--
- In a minute.

731
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,468
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

732
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,636
Mr. Campbell.

733
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,805
Do you know what you did
to Freddie Rumsen?

734
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:20,973
For just cause.

735
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,391
You didn't have to tell Don.

736
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,600
You told on Mr. Rumsen?

737
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:24,810
Do you mind?

738
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,524
It would have gotten out anyway.

739
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,485
Right, and he'd be some legend
in one of those stupid stories.

740
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,238
Remember the guy who wet his pants
before the big meeting?

741
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,406
Instead, he's finished.

742
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,157
Why do you feel bad for him?

743
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,119
Those people always blame
their problems on society.

744
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,746
He did it to himself.
Those people have no self-control.

745
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,748
lf it wasn't for him,
I'd stilI be a secretary.

746
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,668
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a junior copywriter.

747
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,840
I refuse to feel bad .
We're going to get raises.

748
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,216
You could get his office.

749
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,804
Now, I'll go first.

750
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,973
Congratulations, Peggy.

751
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,811
Congratulations, Pete.

752
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,405
Good to see you.

753
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,782
This is me.

754
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,118
It's nice to see you.

755
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,619
What are you doing here?

756
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,163
Betty invited me for lunch,

757
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,373
but we're gonna need
another place setting.

758
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,669
We're gonna be three.

759
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,133
Betty didn't say you'd be joining us.

760
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,135
I hope I'm not intruding.

761
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,595
She thought it'd be fun.

762
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,805
It will be.

763
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,017
It's just gotten infinitely more fun.

764
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,979
I think I need whatever you're having.

765
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,732
It's a gin and tonic.

766
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,484
Nothing speciaI.

767
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,152
It's perfect.

768
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,702
Keep stirring.

769
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,459
Bobby, go get two spoons.

770
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,185
So with Indian Point open now,

771
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,146
we should be able to use
even a modest safety record.

772
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,899
We were spitballing about a cartoon turtle.

773
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,195
Kids. Keeps it friendly and nature-loving,

774
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,905
and then we just hammer
the Ravenswood area

775
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,532
until they're ready for the next plant.

776
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:45,992
You on board with that?

777
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,372
Yes.

778
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,417
I want to see schedules,

779
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,627
and I want to see this turtle.

780
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,304
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

781
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,600
Hello, Don.

782
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,686
Hello, Mona. Jane, it's okay.

783
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,734
Just stop.

784
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,902
What?

785
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,531
I don't even know what to say to you.

786
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,032
About what?

787
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,702
Don't act innocent.

788
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,955
He's leaving me for his secretary.

789
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,206
Roger?

790
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,460
He's in love,
and you said it was great.

791
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,086
Mona, I didn't say anything.

792
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:42,632
"It's your life.
You have to move forward."

793
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,887
Mona, I didn't mean it that way.

794
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,847
25 years of marriage.

795
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,395
I want you to calm down.

796
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,814
Don't make me make a scene.

797
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,691
We should talk about this.

798
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,693
You can talk to Margaret.

799
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,553
Listen, Don, I can explain.

800
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,597
I want her off my desk.

801
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,689
