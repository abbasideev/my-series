1
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,010
When did you get up?

2
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,889
I don't know.

3
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,475
Is it still Saturday?

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,729
I need you to fix
the outlet in the dining room.

5
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,606
I thought you were going
to call an electrician.

6
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,402
All you need to do is unscrew the fuse
and replace the plug, Don.

7
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,280
Sounds like you could do it.

8
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,242
I need to be able to plug in the hot pIate.

9
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,788
Okay.

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,332
Bets, come here.

11
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,965
Look, you've got a week before this party,

12
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,635
and it doesn't have to be a big deal.

13
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,553
Carla will help you.

14
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,472
We're going to have a house full of people.

15
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,350
I'd appreciate it if you'd take care
of the things on the list.

16
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,311
Birdie, I'Il fix it.

17
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,438
Thank you.

18
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,278
Hello.

19
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,989
Perfect timing. Ma just left.

20
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,574
You two are on
your honeymoon, Mr. Seeger?

21
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,992
Yes.

22
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,328
And how did you meet
this lovely young lady?

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,996
At a New Year's Eve party.

24
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,999
I brought colored pencils for the boys.

25
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,460
They're out back throwing rocks
at my laundry.

26
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,004
How is he?

27
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,422
I don't know.

28
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,132
I told you about the chiropractor.

29
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,009
They're not doctors.

30
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,011
Did I tell you he cried?

31
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,096
Anita--

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,348
Sometimes I think about Mike Ryan.
Remember him?

33
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,559
Stop it. Gerry has a job.

34
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,018
He hates it.

35
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,812
He told me he hated it,

36
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,730
and then a week later his back started.

37
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,650
His buddies from work
don't even come by anymore.

38
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,986
They think he's a malingerer.

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,990
And Ma, all she can talk
about are her bunions.

40
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,118
I checked out the next
Horatio Hornblower for him.

41
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,037
I was right. There is only
one book about Moby Dick.

42
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,956
Him with the books.

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,125
Who is it?

44
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,543
I don't know.

45
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,048
Oh, Lord.

46
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,927
Hello, Father.
What a pleasant surprise.

47
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,053
WelI, I'm sorry for dropping in.

48
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,055
I just thought that he could use a visit.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,056
Bless you.

50
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,057
How is he?

51
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,350
Much better, thanks.

52
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,435
Good, good. I'm glad.

53
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,730
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Father.

54
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,898
Let me see if he's awake.

55
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,441
No, please don't disturb him.

56
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,693
Nonsense. He'll be thrilled.

57
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,531
It means a lot that you're visiting.

58
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,700
You as well, I'm sure.

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,327
Are you hungry?

60
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,871
I've already been fed a few times today.

61
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,497
It's a wonderful community, you know?

62
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,374
It is.

63
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,422
l see you at church,
but you don't seem very comfortable.

64
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,175
No. That's not true.

65
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,428
You don't participate.
You keep to yourself.

66
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,643
You know, there are
many ways to be involved.

67
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,104
There's a committee for the CYO dance.

68
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,356
And for selfish reasons,

69
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,150
I would love to take advantage
of your professional services again.

70
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,860
What do you mean?

71
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,111
Publicity.

72
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:43,407
Last year's poster was girls in garlands
dancing around a maypole.

73
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,618
I don't think that's what the kids want.

74
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,120
No. They don't.

75
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,623
I'm so busy right now, Father.

76
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,500
Think of it as pro bono.

77
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,960
Talk to your boss.

78
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,504
I really would like the kids to show up.

79
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,673
He's ready to see you, Father.

80
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,716
I'll get you the specifics.

81
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,642
As of today, you are costing this company
more than you are making it.

82
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,143
Excuse me?

83
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,145
Tim Dunst called from Maytag.

84
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,148
ApparentIy, last night, their switchboard
lit up like a Christmas tree.

85
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,317
- I didn't hear--
- You're head of the teleνision department,

86
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,152
so I know you can't watch everything.

87
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,862
But who exactly oversaw the placement

88
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,240
of Maytag in The ABC Sunday Night Movie?

89
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,662
WelI, I take full responsibility.

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,914
There was a scene
with a murderous Russian spy

91
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,166
who was referred to
as an agitator repeatedly,

92
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,960
and this led into a Maytag spot,

93
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,921
the title of which is "The Amazing Agitator."

94
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,549
Really?

95
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,342
Is this all a big joke to you?

96
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,177
The Russians are still our enemy, you know.

97
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,179
This wilI not happen again.

98
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,181
Crane, we're eating this one.

99
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,975
Politics aside, you need to be aware

100
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,602
that a client will take
any excuse not to pay us.

101
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,272
You need to get
your department in line, or l'll gut it.

102
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,440
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,275
I'll get to the bottom of this.

104
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,203
Hey, Harry, what's the name
of that place we went to

105
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,747
with the wallpaper and the kebabs?

106
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,873
I don't remember.

107
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,374
Can one of you help me read TV scripts?

108
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,584
For money?

109
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,918
I don't think so.

110
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,920
There's too much to read,
and I have nobody.

111
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,214
There are things to do
that I didn't know were my job.

112
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,300
How could that be?
You made that job up.

113
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,596
I thought I would be a liaison
between the networks and the agency

114
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,097
and, I don't know, buy time.

115
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,308
That's what your job was before.

116
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,560
So now what? It's a whole 'nother job.

117
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,103
That's why we have juniors.

118
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,229
Someone to blame.

119
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,231
You need someone to lay down
on the barbed wire

120
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,983
so you can run over them.

121
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,243
Heineken was pleased but confused.

122
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,037
By the fact that you don't use their product?

123
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,247
That's why l brought Campbell.

124
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,249
So what's the problem?

125
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,001
They're set on competing at the tap.

126
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,213
We just have to find a way
to excite your average tavern inhabitant,

127
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,380
and they'll be happy.

128
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,008
Did you explain to them that there's a market

129
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,344
that's actually excited
about Heineken being imported?

130
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,348
For women entertaining in the home,
Holland is Paris.

131
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,558
They can buy this sophisticated beer

132
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,353
and proudly walk it into the kitchen
instead of hiding it in the garage.

133
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,271
I'm just telling you I sensed resistance.

134
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,606
If you want to get some research,

135
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,316
I'll get them into a room with you again.

136
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,318
Okay.

137
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,153
We'll go up and down the Hudson,

138
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,697
northern New Jersey,
Connecticut, the cash belt--

139
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,033
set up a few end-aisle
displays at the A&Ps,

140
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,535
away from the other beer,

141
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,288
surrounded by cheese and crackers
and toothpicks with ceIlophane tips.

142
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,623
We can try that.

143
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,291
Maybe short, uneven stacks.

144
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,543
Make it look popular.

145
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,294
Plus, housewives love green.

146
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,754
We'll go make some calls.

147
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,091
You're still going to have to sit down
and sell this to them.

148
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,303
By the way,
I hate to disappoint your wife,

149
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,472
but l don't know about Sunday night.

150
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,015
I'd worry more about disappointing Roger.

151
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,310
He seemed to think it was important
that we sit down with Crab Colson.

152
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,480
And believe me, I'm sure my wife
would rather go see a movie.

153
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,649
Who's Crab Colson?

154
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,651
Rogers & Cowan.

155
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,028
I'll get the time from your girl again.

156
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,602
Mr. Sterling is here to see you.

157
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,147
Send him in, please.

158
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,484
- Roger.
- Crane.

159
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,906
Mitch says you want
to expand your department.

160
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,783
Looks pretty big already.

161
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,953
Well, the way other television departments
have this set up--

162
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,204
and l've checked on this--

163
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,082
there should be a dedicated man
for Broadcast Operations.

164
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,667
And what is he dedicated to?

165
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,419
Reading scripts, meetings to discuss.

166
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,464
I'm really the face of the television
department for the clients.

167
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,632
Have you noticed we're full up?

168
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,092
Who's going to pay this person, you?

169
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,844
The money we save avoiding surprises
will make it worthwhile.

170
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,429
You smoke, Crane?

171
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,722
Sometimes.

172
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,476
How do I know you're not just goIdbricking?

173
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,769
Because that's what Mitch thinks.

174
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,690
I don't want to speak out of turn--

175
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,984
Warren, do you mind?

176
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,781
I don't think Mitch has been very happy
with my recent promotion.

177
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,865
Are you?

178
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,534
Yes, of course.

179
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,870
Figure out a way to do the job yourself.

180
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,627
You better not repeat any of that to Mitch.

181
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,013
Peggy Olson's office.

182
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,681
May l speak with Miss Olson?

183
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,558
This is Father John Gill calling.

184
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,188
Peggy Olson speaking.

185
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,524
Hello, Peggy.
This is Father John Gill.

186
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,900
Do you have a minute?

187
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,819
Yes. Did you get the flyer?

188
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,070
Yes.

189
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,490
It's good, but can you take
whatever this is

190
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,368
and make it into a poster?

191
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,579
What do you mean, whatever this is?

192
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,457
Well, there's been some discussion.

193
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,709
Don't you like it?

194
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,505
The CYO committee is curious
about "A Night to Remember."

195
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,966
What's the problem?

196
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,887
Well, they feel it sends
the wrong message to the girls.

197
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,515
It's wholesome and romantic.

198
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,933
And you have to get the girls.

199
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,518
It's the only way the boys will come.

200
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,020
Well--

201
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,022
Tell them that this is the way it works,

202
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,440
and l know better than them.

203
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,527
Peggy, couldn't you just speak with them?

204
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,031
They just want to feel involved.

205
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,741
Of course.

206
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,202
I'd love to hear their thoughts.

207
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,536
Good-bye, Father.

208
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,996
Good-bye.

209
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,877
Unlike some deodorants,

210
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,588
Fresh doesn't promise you
eternal romance.

211
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,800
Mr. Crane, may l be of some assistance?

212
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,843
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,220
What?

214
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,931
I received a memo
from Mr. Sterling's office,

215
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,892
saying that you needed a girl
to help you with your workload.

216
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,562
No, that's not exactly what I asked for.

217
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,649
WelI, I don't know what you had in mind,
but we are spread very thin.

218
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,026
Hello, Joan.

219
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,569
Hello, Warren.

220
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,656
You. . .

221
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,616
You look great today.

222
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,743
Thank you, Warren.

223
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,662
I need someone to run
our commercial scripts

224
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,581
past the networks for approval.

225
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,624
Can't you just use a messenger?

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,669
No. That person also has to read
the network scripts for me

227
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,838
and really make sure
our clients aren't misrepresented.

228
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,966
I don't feeI comfortable
sending my girls out of the building,

229
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,926
but l will find someone to read the scripts.

230
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,719
My wife is pregnant.

231
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,180
I just want to get out of here
at a reasonable hour.

232
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,224
How many are there?

233
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,477
And what are they looking for?

234
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,729
We just want to nip
any problems in the bud.

235
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,607
For example, if a kid's pushing away
his dinner in disgust,

236
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,110
just make sure it's not Gorton's fish sticks.

237
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,612
You know, people can't be
coughing and dying

238
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,738
right before a Lucky ad.

239
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,323
Things Iike that.
It's common sense, really.

240
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,616
It sounds interesting.

241
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,619
It is. For the first few.

242
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,621
And there's Maytag in there.

243
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,290
They're very sensitive to Communism.

244
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,338
Why can't I do that?

245
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,965
Because you already have a job.

246
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,634
No. I mean talk to her like that.

247
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,678
She's so much woman.

248
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,884
You are so graceful.

249
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,677
She is adorable.

250
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,387
They're doing Winnie the Pooh this year.

251
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,932
She's going to be Piglet.

252
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,475
It's all very professional-looking.

253
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,686
CheryI's 1 4. She won't even waltz
on my feet anymore.

254
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,605
Ours is engaged.

255
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,690
Enjoy it while you can.

256
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,276
Crab, can I get you another one of those?

257
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,154
Like the song says, I'd be a fool to say no.

258
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,908
- Roger?
- Ladies first.

259
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,993
All right, the evening show is over.

260
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,704
Bedtime. Say good-bye to everybody.

261
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,041
Good night.

262
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,627
- Good night, slugger.
- Good night.

263
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,712
Hello.

264
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,714
Hello, Mrs. Draper.

265
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,424
Betty.

266
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,926
These are beautiful.

267
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,428
I'm sorry l'm late. My date cancelled.

268
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,097
You should have called.

269
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,807
I might have been able to replace her.

270
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,602
Carla, would you please
put these in water?

271
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,272
And our head count is now seven.

272
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,732
What a lovely home.

273
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,609
Hello, Duck.

274
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,528
I remember you, SalIy.

275
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,654
Hello.

276
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,239
And who do we have here?

277
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,323
This is Bobby.

278
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,783
Bobby, shake Mr. Phillips' hand.

279
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,744
Do you like baseball, Bobby?

280
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,747
Come on. Let's go to bed.

281
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,752
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't want to come stag.

282
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,753
Nobody cares.

283
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,798
l don't know.
My wife hated odd numbers.

284
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
Well, hello, there.

285
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,846
Duck Phillips, you know Mona.

286
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
Of course.

287
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,682
Hello.

288
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,435
Of course this is Petra and Crab Colson.

289
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,772
Crab, Duck. Duck, Crab.

290
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,649
Can l get you something?

291
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,942
Tomato juice, if you have it.

292
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,485
Come on.

293
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,362
I'll have something with dinner.

294
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,114
Beautiful drive.

295
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,574
- Did you take the Sawmill?
- l did.

296
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,826
Found myself heading
to New Rochelle by accident.

297
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,411
I used to live there.

298
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,537
It's lovely there.

299
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,122
I'll tell you the way to go.

300
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,833
We're taking our sloop
from my folks' place in Old Lyme

301
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,793
all the way down to Larchmont
for Race Week.

302
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,961
We should get a boat.

303
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,464
My father had a boat. Almost kiIled him.

304
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,799
You might as well
cut a hole in your pocket.

305
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,135
The slip and the dry dock
and the yacht club.

306
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,887
Speaking of which, Don,

307
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,348
are you and Bets joining
Willow Oaks or not?

308
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,891
We're lonely.

309
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,810
lf you wish, you can
leave your drinks here

310
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,395
and join us in the dining room.

311
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,439
Terrific.

312
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,732
So, Rogers & Cowan.

313
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,651
It's a good place to be right now.

314
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,823
He does everything
you need him to do, you know?

315
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,825
WelI, we took the road that goes to--

316
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,913
How did that get there?

317
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,543
We're going to take a little trip
around the world,

318
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,921
starting in Spain with gazpacho,

319
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,423
followed by Japan-- rumaki--

320
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,384
and then we'll stop by Duchess County

321
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,636
for a leg of lamb, mint jelly,

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,845
accompanied by egg noodIes,

323
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,889
the way my grandmother
made them from Germany.

324
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,892
And we have a choice
of burgundy from France

325
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,937
or a frosted glass of beer from Holland.

326
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,357
Did you bring a case from work?

327
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,858
No.

328
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,859
Oh, please, Draper.

329
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,361
You'll do anything to win an argument.

330
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,987
I don't understand.

331
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,324
You went out and bought that?
At the store?

332
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,909
Carla did some of the marketing,

333
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,954
but no, I did. Why?

334
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,957
I'm not even allowed to pick where I sit.

335
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,753
What's so funny?

336
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,630
Crab, if you want to be in business

337
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,048
with someone who knows their stuff--

338
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,883
Heineken is one of our clients.

339
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,261
He said you were the market, and you are.

340
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,890
- That is funny.
- Incredible.

341
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,768
What an interesting experiment.

342
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,730
I have to sit down.

343
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,022
Please do.

344
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,649
Now who wants wine?

345
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,485
Please start.

346
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,830
The soup is delicious.

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,250
To our hosts.

348
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,503
And their idyllic country home,

349
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,422
and to new friends.

350
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,007
Hear, hear.

351
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,435
"A Night to Remember"
is every girl's dream.

352
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,271
It holds the wholesome promise
of the kind of hand-holding

353
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,023
that eventually leads to marriage.

354
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,694
I think it's exactly what we talked about.

355
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,988
I don't like the way they're dancing.

356
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,115
They're too cIose together.

357
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,452
Maybe leave some room
for the Holy Ghost.

358
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,455
Uh, maybe they're doing a box step.

359
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,708
Fine.

360
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,253
You're not worried about
having a dance full of girls only?

361
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,297
When the boys hear
that the girls are going--

362
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,840
The boys aren't going to hear nothing.

363
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,509
They don't go to school together.

364
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,552
They go to church together.

365
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,055
And this isn't the first CYO event.

366
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,890
That's true.

367
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,975
I'd never thought about that,
but you're right.

368
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,978
I'm just saying I'm not an expert,

369
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,897
but there might be another slogan.

370
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,859
What do you want, two flyers?

371
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,946
No. We don't have to
throw this one away,

372
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,949
but maybe we can, um--

373
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:23,078
I think she's saying
maybe we should try something else.

374
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,670
Thank you very much.
I'll see what I can do.

375
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,296
You're such a doll.

376
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,843
Could I speak to you a minute?

377
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,054
Father, I wanted to talk to you, too.

378
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,974
We can speak tomorrow.

379
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,936
Thank you all for your
generosity and your time.

380
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,032
Father, I don't mind working,

381
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,827
but this is completely unnecessary.

382
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,037
Well, I don't understand.

383
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,039
Did you agree with them?

384
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,041
The dancers could be farther apart,

385
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,043
but you were very persuasive.

386
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,879
You don't have to agree with them.

387
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,630
In fact, you're not supposed to.

388
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,967
You asked me to do this
based on my expertise.

389
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,428
WelI, I'm not really on the committee.

390
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,971
I'm more of a liaison.

391
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,307
You're supposed to teIl them
that they shouId trust me.

392
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,058
That's your job.

393
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,643
They'll listen to you.

394
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,062
You're right.

395
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,231
I'm sorry this is so much work.

396
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,817
No, l can turn it around.

397
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,068
And the copy machine?

398
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,070
Yes, I cleared it.

399
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,196
I'm sorry, Father.

400
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,115
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

401
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,034
I'm very tired.

402
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,994
We'll both be prepared next time.

403
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,162
Come on.

404
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,918
Good night, Peggy.

405
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,377
I really am glad you're here.

406
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,962
Me, too.

407
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,100
You didn't set the table?

408
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,812
I'm sorry. You came back so fast.

409
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,439
I'll get plates.

410
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,736
You're not going to believe what happens
on As the World Turns.

411
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,112
You're right about that.

412
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,031
Let me ask you something.

413
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,533
Is it possible for someone
to come out of a coma

414
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,119
and have no recollection of who they are?

415
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,622
Honestly, people don't
come out of comas much.

416
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,748
Really?

417
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,416
So it's also probably ridiculous

418
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,710
they would have an accent
they didn't have beforehand?

419
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,087
Yes.

420
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,672
WelI, it must have happened to somebody.

421
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,465
I mean, they wouldn't
make it up completely, right?

422
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,176
Probably once. Makes a good story.

423
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,679
I'm going to get my drink.
Do you want something?

424
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,846
Water.

425
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,395
I didn't know you were such a reader.

426
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,146
It's part of my job.

427
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,149
I thought you just walked around
with people staring at you.

428
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,318
You.

429
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,865
What are you bothering with that for?

430
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,159
You should be looking for a house.

431
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,162
What happened to your fascination
with Glen Cove?

432
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,039
You told me to stop looking.

433
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:17,043
WelI, I just need to finish my training.

434
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,255
Joanie, you should be watching
those shows, not reading them,

435
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,175
with a box of bonbons on your lap
to soothe your cravings.

436
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,635
It's a hoot.

437
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,512
I guess that's okay.

438
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,098
I'm glad you approve.

439
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,061
Were you going to get me
a glass of water, hon?

440
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,272
Of course.

441
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,996
Hey, Chuck, you're gonna have to
wear a tag on your shirt.

442
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,205
I won't know you--

443
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,707
Carla, why don't you go home?

444
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,001
We can do all this in the morning.

445
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,335
That jam will set.

446
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,130
Let me at least put the dishes in the basin.

447
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,631
That's a good idea.

448
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,678
If you want, you can go to bed.

449
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,222
I'll show myself out,
call Louis to pick me up.

450
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,767
It's okay. We had a long day.

451
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,727
Thank you for all your help.

452
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,900
Good night, Mr. Draper.

453
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,152
Good night, Carla.

454
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,321
It was a great success.

455
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,414
Molly Horton is a paying customer
on this one.

456
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,458
I'm with you, Major.
Running a wagon train is a--

457
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,959
Hey.

458
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,755
You embarrassed me.

459
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,341
What are you talking about?

460
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,343
You embarrassed me.

461
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,137
What did I do?

462
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,848
You knew I would buy that beer.

463
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,767
So what?

464
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,019
Because you know me so well.

465
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,813
You know everything about me.

466
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,399
Bets, I use our life alI the time in my work.

467
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,818
They pay me for that.

468
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,569
And then you laughed.

469
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,197
You all laughed.

470
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,866
Must be so funny being in on it.

471
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,910
Come on.

472
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,288
You're taking this the wrong way.

473
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,582
You embarrassed me.

474
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,043
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,419
I didn't mean it.

476
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,963
You never mean it.

477
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,423
You just do whatever you want,

478
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,342
and l put up with it because nobody knows.

479
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,177
No one is going to remember that.

480
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,720
You know what they're
going to remember?

481
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,348
Petra Colson missing her chair.

482
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,643
Come on. Leave this. You're tired.

483
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,687
Let's go upstairs.

484
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,605
I'm not going to bed.

485
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,526
Not until you tell me
why you insist on humiliating me.

486
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,820
Betty, I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

487
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,030
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

488
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,410
I know about you and that woman.

489
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,453
What?

490
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,956
Damn it, Don, I know you're having an affair.

491
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,712
You and Bobbie Barrett.

492
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,130
What?

493
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,717
How could you? She's so old.

494
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,219
Betty, that's ridiculous.

495
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,264
I'm just telling you I know.

496
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,979
Fine, Bets.

497
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,106
What do you know?

498
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,111
Go ahead. Tell me.

499
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,863
Jimmy told me everything.

500
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,158
Jimmy. He hates me.

501
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,659
He toId me everything.

502
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,369
Please. What the hell did he say?

503
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,372
So you can pick it apart?
Twist all my words?

504
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,042
l'm not going to dignify
Jimmy Barrett with a response.

505
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,960
He's a big mouth.

506
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,879
And don't pretend I don't
know how he Iooks at you.

507
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,091
I saw you two together.

508
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,385
You think you know me?

509
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,721
WelI, I know what kind of a man you are.

510
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,390
You think I would sleep with that woman?

511
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,184
You can't heIp yourself.

512
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,479
Admit it.

513
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,648
There's nothing to admit.

514
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,483
You're lying.

515
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,611
I'm going to bed.

516
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,970
Good morning.

517
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,388
Good morning, Daddy.

518
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,934
Mommy said the party was fun.

519
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,270
Did she?

520
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,985
Okay.

521
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,237
Bye-bye.

522
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,822
Bye, Daddy.

523
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,165
Aren't you going to be a daddy soon?

524
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,500
I've done my part. The rest is up to her.

525
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,252
Don't pay attention to that due date.

526
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,253
It'll drive you nuts.

527
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,255
- D Day.
- Hello.

528
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,383
This is Mr. Pastern
and Mr. Kostis from Maytag.

529
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,302
- Are we all better now?
- Yes.

530
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,554
Process seems to be streamlined.

531
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,516
Wait a minute. Is she the one
we spoke to on the phone?

532
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,519
Yes. Joan is handling
Broadcast Operations.

533
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,772
I had no idea.

534
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,107
I would have combed my hair
before I caIled you.

535
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,234
I've got next week's scripts.

536
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,611
Don't hold anything back now.

537
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,904
She won't.

538
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,199
WelI, it was nice to meet
both of you in person.

539
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,367
Indeed.

540
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,120
Hell of an operation you've got here, Crane.

541
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,747
I think so.

542
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,000
Gentlemen.

543
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,210
Phil. Good to see you, as always.

544
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,046
Francis. Can we get you something?

545
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,424
We've got a fridge
full of Heineken out there.

546
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,051
No. lt's 1 1 a.m. , for Pete's sake.

547
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,636
WelI, thanks for coming by.

548
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,096
We were just so excited,

549
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,348
I thought you should hear it
from the horse's mouth.

550
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,725
What exactly happened?

551
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,686
Well. . .

552
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,732
We explained to you before
that research shows

553
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,275
that with the rise in commuters

554
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,652
and the relative scarcity
of suburban bars,

555
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,821
people are drinking more in the home.

556
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,198
Yes, we heard you.

557
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:28,367
Entertaining housewives, et cetera.

558
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,702
We're not against it.

559
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,539
We just think our money would
be spent better elsewhere.

560
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,666
And honestly, l agree with you,

561
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,628
but, well, we ran a little test,

562
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,672
and the results were very enlightening.

563
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,007
Don?

564
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,885
We targeted
a few wealthy suburban markets

565
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,888
with woman-friendly end-aisle displays.

566
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,556
Was there a spike?

567
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,683
The sample was very small,

568
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,685
but what we put out sold weIl.

569
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,064
More important was who it sold to.

570
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:02,360
This is an untapped market
where you dictate the competition.

571
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,155
I think l can say this
because Don's being modest.

572
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,699
Don's wife, she's a peach of a girl.

573
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,368
They had a dinner party.

574
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,702
We're talking days after placement,

575
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,956
and she had this elaborate, elegant setup--

576
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,499
foods from around the globe.

577
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,709
And sure enough,
there was your Heineken,

578
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,212
right next to the bone china
and the polished sterling.

579
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,713
It was incredible.

580
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,216
Not exactly scientific.

581
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,344
Although it sounds like
you do know your wife.

582
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,179
She's exactly who we're after--

583
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,516
well-off, educated,
with plenty of time to shop.

584
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,268
And it's important for her

585
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,729
that she's the perfect hostess,
the perfect wife.

586
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,107
We even talked about
using her menu verbatim

587
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,650
in selected ladies' magazines.

588
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,901
Really?

589
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,903
We haven't been there yet.

590
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,739
No, but it's what I've been pushing for.

591
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,075
And so I take your word on this?

592
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,577
Why would l lie?

593
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,662
We're the ones who are
going to have to deliver.

594
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,751
I guess we could throw it in the mix.

595
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,753
Let's start regional.

596
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,840
See how some strangers' wives feel.

597
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,429
I would recommend
buying air time during Love of Life.

598
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,556
Women watching TV during the day

599
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,766
like to fantasize
about having active lifestyles.

600
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,519
They like where they could
be going with Sea & Ski.

601
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,021
And they watch every day.

602
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,523
I know my daughter missed
a lot of classes in college

603
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,774
for her stories.

604
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,735
My wife brought the TV home.

605
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:26,777
There you go.

606
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,114
Mr. Hansen, I don't know
how Mr. Crane feels about this,

607
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,408
but l've been reading the scripts,

608
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,868
and l just have to say

609
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,287
As the World Turns
is about to become unmissable.

610
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,788
I don't want to give it away,

611
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,876
but someone people think is dead is not.

612
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,546
I'm glad you like it, but they all do
the same things, don't they?

613
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,756
No. Not at all.

614
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,383
This is what they call
a special summer storyline,

615
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,594
and l've spoken
to Logan Reynolds over at CBS,

616
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,804
and it's going to receive a lot of promotion.

617
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:54,889
Is it the same price?

618
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,599
WelI, they're all close.

619
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,059
This sounds better.

620
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:02,021
WelI, if you lock them in at this rating
and then they exceed it,

621
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,814
there's a bang
for your buck factor, isn't there?

622
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,232
I would say so.

623
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,901
Then you should do that.

624
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,322
I think you'll be pleased.

625
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,824
That's why I didn't want
to do this on the phone.

626
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,495
I love what she says,
and l love the way she says it.

627
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,538
Let me walk you out.

628
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,053
Are you okay, Mommy?

629
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,059
I'm okay, sweetheart.

630
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,853
I'm just not feeling very well.

631
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,272
Do you want some aspirin?

632
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,525
No, Sally.

633
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,152
I'm just going to rest a little bit, okay?

634
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,197
Go play with your brother.

635
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,907
Okay.

636
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,089
Shit.

637
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,446
Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.

638
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,865
You said 4:30.

639
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,825
Hell, is it only 4:30?

640
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,368
Sorry about that.

641
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,828
Listen, I'll be brief,

642
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,913
since it appears I'm on my way out.

643
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,082
I've received a lot
of unsolicited phone calls.

644
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,917
Simply put, the customers are satisfied,

645
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,252
and so is the accounting department.

646
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,462
Keep up the good work.

647
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,172
WelI, I'm not doing it on my own.

648
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,549
Right. That's true, isn't it?

649
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,177
Why don't we get those secretaries
back to their regular jobs?

650
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,928
It's just Joan Holloway, actually.

651
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,556
So her attentions are divided at best.

652
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,560
Make it a full-time position, 1 50 a week,
and he has to share an office.

653
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,895
Sounds perfect.

654
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,373
Hello.

655
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,972
Where are the kids?

656
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,475
Bed.

657
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,647
What happened here?

658
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,982
Nothing.

659
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,984
Nothing happened here.

660
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:58,239
I went through every pocket
and every drawer,

661
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,573
and there's nothing.

662
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,492
Would you stop?

663
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,077
How much have you had to drink?

664
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,287
I don't even know why I bother looking.

665
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:11,460
All I found were stacks of cocktail napkins
with stupid advertising on them.

666
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,212
What are you doing, Bets?

667
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,176
I would never do this to you.

668
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,764
How could you do this to me?

669
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,518
I didn't do anything.

670
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,260
Don.

671
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,017
What time is it?

672
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,732
I don't want it to be like this.

673
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,239
Me, either.

674
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,493
I don't know what to do.

675
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,165
Don't.

676
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,839
Nothing happened.

677
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,426
Now you look me in the eye.

678
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,887
You never do that.

679
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,057
Yes, I do.

680
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,185
You never say you love me.

681
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,106
Yes, I do.

682
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,109
You know I do.

683
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,195
I say it all the time.

684
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,197
No, you don't.

685
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,121
Do you hate me?

686
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,707
God, no.

687
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,836
I love you, Bets.

688
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,006
I do.

689
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,716
And I love the children.

690
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,222
I don't want to lose all this.

691
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,579
This is a very impressive operation.

692
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,456
It's Madison Avenue.

693
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,960
Look at this.

694
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,087
Did we get Miracle Whip?

695
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,089
I don't know.

696
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,507
Makes a lot of sense.

697
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,259
She's an undercover nun.

698
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,470
So, Turk doesn't know which way to turn,

699
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,889
he's so drunk, so finally he stops.

700
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,182
We get out of the car,

701
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,269
and the sign says "Bridge Out."

702
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,939
- Hello, Joan.
- You wanted to see me?

703
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,524
Joan, this is Danny Lindstrom.

704
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,900
Dan.

705
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,946
He's going to be in charge
of Broadcast Operations.

706
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,948
Excuse me?

707
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,616
I've really appreciated you filling in.

708
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,160
I couldn't have asked for more.

709
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,453
Joan knows everything about this.

710
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,621
Well, that makes one of us.

711
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,875
I've already given him next week's scripts.

712
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,502
It would be great if you
could fill him in on how it works.

713
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,337
Right now?

714
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,048
Why not? Are you busy?

715
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,427
No. Not at all.

716
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,308
It's really just reading
the scripts, all of them,

717
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,226
and Iooking through the storylines

718
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,980
to see if there's any. . .

719
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,233
possible benefits to our clients,

720
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,153
how their products
may be portrayed to their advantage,

721
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,531
and, of course,
getting the cooperation of the networks.

722
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,325
That's pretty much what I said.

723
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,494
Not exactly.

724
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,331
Listen, you're going to be around
to help with the details, right?

725
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,251
Yes, of course.

726
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,252
Anything else?

727
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,421
No, Joan. And thank you again.

728
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,268
This is wonderfuI.
It's completely automatic.

729
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,603
I just leave it.

730
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,480
If you set the number.

731
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,568
You know, don't think we don't know

732
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,071
how lucky we are having
you do this for us.

733
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,865
Thank you. lt's nice to be included.

734
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,584
Peggy, do you have something
you need to talk about?

735
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,586
Excuse me?

736
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,922
Well, I've noticed that you
don't take Communion.

737
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,924
And I don't think it's too much of a leap

738
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,761
to ask if there's something
you need to talk about.

739
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,264
No.

740
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,350
God already knows whatever it is, Peggy.

741
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,311
Well, then l don't need to talk.

742
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,398
WelI, I'm here right now.

743
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,320
Father, don't take this the wrong way,

744
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:34,241
but l don't think you'd understand.

745
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,829
God is bigger than what we were raised on.

746
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:45,294
Father, you don't have to live life
like the rest of us.

747
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,336
Maybe you're lucky.

748
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,297
I've lived life.

749
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,048
I wasn't born a priest.

750
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,425
Of course not.

751
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,180
You know, when you distance
yourself from the church,

752
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,850
you are distancing
yourself from everything.

753
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,352
That's why it's called Communion,
you know.

754
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,104
It's not just being with God.

755
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,023
It's being with people.

756
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,358
I know that.

757
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,196
Well, then, why are you
pushing everyone away?

758
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm not.

759
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,620
There is no sin too great to bring to God.

760
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,708
You can reconcile yourself with him
and have a whole new start.

761
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,754
You're a smart, beautiful young girl.

762
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,923
You have so much to offer.

763
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,721
Do you feel you don't deserve his Iove?

764
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,317
Your copies are done.

765
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,905
I'll put them in a box for you.

766
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,293
There you go.

767
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,420
Thank you very much, Peggy.

768
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,713
I'll see you on Sunday?

769
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,590
Yes, of course.

770
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,977
Welcome to the club.

771
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:32,317
So I pulled Sylvia's hair
and treated her mean.

772
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,902
She ran after me all the time,

773
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,446
and every day she took me
down to the malt shop

774
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,990
to split a soda with her.

775
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,493
And just like that, l lose her.

776
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,245
How do you know you lost her?

777
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,122
Today I walked into the malt shop,

778
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,749
and there was another guy
at the end of my straw.

779
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,465
Imagine my horror when
a night on the town turned ugly.

780
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,467
This is a nice place for nice people.

781
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,470
And the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

782
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,555
What am I , a squirrel?

783
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,516
Lucky for him,

784
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,935
I carry my own wherever I go.

785
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,813
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

786
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,774
Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.

787
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,736
Take it from a nut.

788
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,571
Utz are better than nuts.

789
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,413
We have chains in almost
every suburban market

790
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,249
on the East Coast,
plus Chicago, Cleveland .

791
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,917
It's a vote of confidence.

792
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,587
Mrs. Draper is on the line.

793
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,214
I got to take this.

794
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,716
Thank her again for me.

795
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,266
Hello.

796
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,518
Don't come home.

797
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,145
What?

798
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,521
I don't care what you do.

799
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,607
I just don't want you here.

800
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:59,571
- Betty.
- Don, l don't want to see you.

801
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,086
WelI, early in the morning

802
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,547
About the break of day

803
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,632
I asked the Lord

804
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:47,220
Help me find the way

805
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,514
To the Promised Land

806
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,685
This lonely body needs a helping hand

807
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,523
I asked the Lord to help me, pIease

808
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:02,819
Find the way

809
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,779
When a new day's a-dawning

810
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,948
I bow my head in prayer

811
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,742
I pray to the Lord

812
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,411
Won't you lead me there?

813
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:15,707
Won't you guide me safely
to the golden stair?

814
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:20,170
Won't you let this body Your burden share?

815
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,422
I pray to the Lord

816
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,674
Won't you lead me, please?

817
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,762
Lead me there.

818
