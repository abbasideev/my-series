00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,624
General Motors, General Electric,

2
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,126
Ion Physics Corporation,

3
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,795
Bell Telephone Laboratories,
Cosmic Inc. ,

4
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,047
Electro-Optical Systems, Incorporated,

5
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:50,758
Texas lnstruments, Inc. ,
General Dynamics Corporation,

00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,927
Hughes Aircraft, Martin Marietta,

7
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,971
Westinghouse, Aerojet,

8
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,431
Radio Corporation of America,

9
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,599
semi-conductors and materials division.

10
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,476
Sounds like a hell of a stock portfolio.

11
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,145
It's everyone who's building a rocket.

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,897
Do you know, if we stay in Beverly Hills,

13
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,566
even though the convention's
in Santa Monica,

14
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,900
we'll be halfway to Pasadena.

15
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,610
Pasadena?

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,154
Isn't it just people with T.B.?

17
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,657
Jet Propulsion Laboratories
and Ray Bradbury.

18
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,159
As much as I'd like to induIge

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,911
your Twilight Zone fantasy
of being shot into space--

20
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,998
Believe me, it's our fantasy, too.

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,541
This is a business trip.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,251
I don't want either of you coming back tan.

23
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,711
What if I have to play golf?

24
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,546
As long as you lose.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,466
Crab Colson guarantees there will be
some astronauts there.

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,385
Really? My nephews
would love an autograph.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,264
Astronauts love golf.
I'll see what I can do.

28
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,391
You're there to sell,
but you're also there to listen.

29
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,894
Every scientist, engineer,
and general is trying

30
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,812
to figure out a way
to put a man on the moon

31
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,191
or blow up Moscow,
whichever one costs more.

32
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,527
We have to explain to them
how we can help them spend that money.

33
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,155
Well, it certainly would
behoove us to find out--

34
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,783
Campbell, you do the talking.
Kinsey, you do the listening.

35
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,120
Don, you wanted me to remind them
about the congressmen.

36
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,748
We know.
They control the purse strings.

37
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,001
No. They are the customer.

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,506
They want aerospace in their districts.

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,843
Let them know that we can help them
bring these contracts home.

40
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,641
Did you read anything that she prepared?

41
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,395
Maybe I should send her.

42
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,493
You know I'll stay out of your way.

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,994
Of course.

44
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,747
Lounging at the pool.

45
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,208
They'll think you're
a young Barbara Stanwyck.

46
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,627
Doesn't that sound like fun?

47
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,048
If you're there, it will make me look
less serious in the office.

48
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,050
Next time.

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,094
It's a week, Tweety.

50
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,346
l suppose I can go to
my parents' place in Rehoboth.

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,099
Now you're making me feel bad.

52
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,600
Is that the only alternative?

53
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,103
They keep asking to spend time with me.

54
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,980
Well, us.

55
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,441
They're concerned.

56
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,402
About what?

57
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,280
Nothing's happening.

58
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,742
Why do you insist on making me
angry before I go to bed?

59
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,121
There are some very reputable agencies.

60
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,664
We can't even talk about this?

61
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,332
Do l have to put my foot down?

62
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,084
What's wrong with it?

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,253
It's someone else's child.

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,135
Once you see a beautiful little baby,
you'll fall in love.

65
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,261
You know you will.

66
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,846
It's not natural.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,639
I felt that way.

68
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,850
But it changed.

69
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,645
We would have our pick.

70
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,355
We are ideal candidates.

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,649
We have means,
and we've been to doctors,

72
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,903
so it's on the record that it's something
we've been wanting for a long time.

73
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,412
Do your parents just think
I say no to everything?

74
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,751
We're not related by blood,
and you love me.

75
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,139
Hello.

76
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,891
It's me.

77
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,894
What time is it?

78
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,854
It's 1 0:00. Are you sleeping?

79
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,731
No.

80
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,317
William called.

81
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,027
My father had a stroke.

82
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,448
Jesus.

83
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,951
Three days ago.

84
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,870
Gloria didn't even call me.
She had William call.

85
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,121
Is it bad?

86
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,417
She said he's up and around, talking,

87
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,294
but she wouldn't put him on the phone.

88
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,755
I'm coming to get you .

89
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,256
No.

90
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,508
Bets, it's not up for discussion.

91
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,884
Take the kids to Francine.

92
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,679
I don't want to wake them.

93
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,555
Fine.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,057
I'll be by in the morning.

95
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,934
God.

96
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,229
You know, I've been
dreaming about a suitcase?

97
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,815
Everything's gonna be okay.

98
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,151
Sure.

99
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,569
Everything's perfect.

100
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,864
I'll be by at 8.

101
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,201
Bye-bye.

102
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,583
Hello, Betty.

103
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,252
Hello, Gloria.

104
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,336
Hello, Don.

105
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,173
Look at the two of you.

106
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,637
I swear to you,
the doctors say it's not serious.

107
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,932
We can get a room down the road
at the William Penn.

108
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,518
Nonsense.

109
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,520
Where is he? Can I see him?

110
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,105
He's getting dressed.

111
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,858
They said he should do things on his own.

112
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,026
Come sit.

113
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,906
Don't do that.

114
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,992
We're supposed to keep it dim.

115
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,702
I don't know why.

116
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,913
Let me check on him.

117
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,625
William. I wasn't expecting you.

118
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,878
- Good morning.
- Look who's here.

119
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,717
He doesn't seem that bad.

120
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,844
Don, good to see you.

121
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,345
Sorry about your dad.

122
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,930
We'll get by, right?

123
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,182
Judy's coming later.

124
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,600
She's dropping the girls off at her mother's.

125
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,395
Gloria, everything is copasetic.

126
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,730
It'll be nice to see her.

127
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,405
It's an angel.

128
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,157
Hi, Daddy.

129
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,035
That's what I needed.

130
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,119
Hello, Don.

131
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,081
Get that look off your face.

132
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,665
Good to see you, Gene.

133
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,543
I'll take a visit from you two
any way I can get it.

134
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,922
Where are the munchkins?

135
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,216
With a neighbor.

136
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,385
Pop, did you see Don's car?

137
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,096
You finally step up to a Lincoln?

138
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,639
Coupe De Ville.

139
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,974
Ice-blue, white top.

140
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,060
Very nice.

141
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,937
How you feeling, Daddy?

142
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,731
It's a tempest in a teapot.

143
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,650
You should've seen her in the ambulance.

144
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:28,072
WelI, we were halfway to the hospital
before l noticed I was in my nightie.

145
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,783
A woman my age should not travel that way.

146
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,910
I wish you'd called earlier.

147
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,663
The other partners at Don's firm
know all kinds of doctors.

148
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,958
In New York, right,
where everything's better.

149
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,547
Always with her brow in a knit,
my Ruthie here.

150
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,883
Ruthie, my love, have you offered
everybody coffee?

151
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,428
I'm Betty.

152
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,889
Of course you are.

153
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,724
Gene, this is Betty, your daughter.

154
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,477
It's not Ruth. Ruth is dead.

155
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,982
Nobody wants coffee, Daddy.

156
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,781
Don, you were able to get off work?

157
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,575
I'm here.

158
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,036
- You want a drink?
- I'll get some ice.

159
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,457
What did the doctors say?

160
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,918
It's just like last time.

161
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,670
What?

162
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,922
Last time? This happened before?

163
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,093
Don't get mad at her.
It's a couple little strokes.

164
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,511
Runs in the family.

165
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,138
You know Gene.

166
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,640
Always has to be the one
taking care of things.

167
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,022
So, Don, how did you come?

168
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,773
Did you take the Turnpike?

169
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,860
Yes.

170
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,208
Look at this. It's my lunch date.

171
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,837
Hello, baby. You're early.

172
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,089
You remember Ken and Pete?

173
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,050
Hello, Sheila.

174
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,094
Want to get in a few more meals
before you lose him to the Golden West?

175
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,347
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,806
We're going to Los Angeles together.

177
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,767
It's horrible, but somebody has to go.

178
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,269
Where?

179
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,437
Californ-I-A.

180
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,314
Thank you, Pete.

181
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,233
Come on, Campbell.

182
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,485
Time to put something else in that mouth.

183
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,611
Nice to see you.

184
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,865
I was going to tell you at lunch.

185
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,910
Why are you going to Los AngeIes?

186
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,828
Come on. Not here.

187
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,169
It just came up.

188
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,712
The election's not for months.

189
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,047
We can register voters in October.

190
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,674
It has nothing to do with the election.

191
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,758
You know that.

192
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,593
If you don't mind,

193
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,097
I'd rather face Mississippi
and those people screaming at me

194
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,058
and maybe getting shot
after I go to California.

195
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,601
Are you scared?

196
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,271
Don't pretend like it's not scary.

197
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,440
Look, I have to go.

198
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,234
Why? What is so important?

199
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,945
It's a convention.

200
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,114
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

201
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,541
Hello, Mr. Kinsey.

202
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,668
Please, Hollis. lt's Paul.

203
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,837
This is Sheila, my girlfriend.

204
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,255
Nice to meet you.

205
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,723
Did you ever really plan
on going down South?

206
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,225
How could you ask that?

207
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,185
This just came up.

208
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,358
You can always get another
job at a grocery store.

209
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,695
I can't just walk into an ad agency.

210
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,031
I can't believe you.

211
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,743
AIl you do is complain about
that place and those people.

212
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,994
That's not true.

213
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,412
WelI, I'm going.

214
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,082
I guess I'll just hop in Billy Kaplan's bus
with ten strangers.

215
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,418
Why can't it wait?

216
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,423
1 9th Street.

217
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,677
This was all supposed to be ours.

218
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,055
I keep thinking what would haνe
happened if Dad had lived.

219
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,682
He'd be on his knees to us.

220
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,144
What about all that money
Dad gave to Lincoln Center?

221
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,604
Get that back.

222
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,065
You can't take a donation back.

223
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,193
Listen, I'm as upset as you are.

224
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,528
We're about to finally buy in Millbrook.

225
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,365
How long can she afford to live?

226
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,493
By golly, Pete, maybe we can
get rid of her tonight.

227
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,703
Remember Rope?

228
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,625
Well, look, all we have to do

229
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,794
is go over there, get her signature,

230
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,546
mourn over the loss
of our birthright, and move on.

231
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,632
I hate going there.

232
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,008
The smell.

233
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,427
To the end of the line.

234
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,268
Does Judy want kids?

235
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,229
We have a five-year plan.

236
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,855
Although secretly I think Judy hopes

237
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,108
we're that childless coupIe
people invite over.

238
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,778
Trudy?

239
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,155
We've tried.

240
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,075
That must be disappointing.

241
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,789
Adoption.

242
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
People do that.

243
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,586
They do.

244
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,927
So, the Yankees are having a hell of a year.

245
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,054
Do you take Bobby?

246
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,472
All the time.

247
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,350
We realIy thought you were going
to make it to Cape May.

248
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,645
Although without Betty there,
everyone had a turn at winning.

249
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,981
Elizabeth's got a mind for cards.

250
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,495
Where were you?

251
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,124
I was hiding in the tree house.

252
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,042
It's like a tomb in there.

253
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,836
I don't know how Don's standing it.

254
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,006
Is this the last picture of her in the house?

255
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,382
I don't know.

256
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,343
And where's the ottoman with the birds?

257
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,138
I don't know, Betty.

258
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,848
I mean, can you blame her?

259
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,766
I wouldn't want to live with Mom's ghost.

260
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,561
She's a silly woman.

261
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,313
All that talk about her underthings.

262
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,650
Daddy used to fine us
for smaIl talk, remember?

263
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,695
Conversation is an art.

264
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,156
Well, it is.

265
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,496
How long has he been like this?

266
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,458
He was acting queer
on the golf course last month.

267
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,835
Let one of the colored caddies
reaIly have it.

268
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,339
Look, Gloria's helping us.

269
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,007
Okay? I don't want to get stuck with him

270
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,259
just because l cared enough
not to move away.

271
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,929
Don works in Manhattan.

272
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,723
You know I wish I could be here.

273
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,016
You only have two kids.

274
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,935
Lord knows Don could afford
to build him a house

275
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,603
in his backyard if he wanted to.

276
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,022
Stop counting other people's money.

277
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,777
And the jardinière.

278
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,695
The what?

279
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,405
It used to be right there.

280
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,533
The ceramic thing?

281
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,538
I think we have that.

282
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,999
Do l have to go around and write my name
on all the things that I want?

283
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,544
Bets, you're drunk.

284
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,421
WelI, I hope everybody's hungry.

285
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,549
We're minutes away.

286
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,551
Why is that window open?

287
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,477
Well, look at that. You found a corner.

288
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,646
You're pulling your end.

289
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,274
Can't say the same about him.

290
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,733
Don's helping.

291
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,070
Who know what he does, why he does it?

292
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,031
I know more about the kid
who fixes my damn car.

293
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,659
Dad, you're hurting Don's feelings.

294
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,120
It's okay.

295
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,873
Nobody has what you have.

296
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,209
You act like it's nothing.

297
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,295
My daughter's a princess.
You know that?

298
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,298
Dinnertime.

299
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,969
What's going on?

300
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,346
He has no people!

301
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,181
You can't trust a person like that!

302
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,433
Daddy.

303
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,983
Fine. Let's go eat.

304
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,288
Come on.

305
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,665
I have no appetite.

306
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,208
Birdie, you should eat.

307
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,752
Stop it, Don.

308
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,629
Nobody's watching.

309
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,434
And here, Mother.

310
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,561
How many of these are there?

311
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,022
Hello, all.

312
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
l brought my pen.
Hope I didn't miss anything.

313
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,402
Other than dinner, no.

314
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,987
Hello, Mother.

315
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,744
I think it's nice that even though
you let Bud do all the work,

316
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,205
you found time to grace us
with your signature.

317
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,916
Yes, well, anything I can do.

318
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,670
I just hope you don't get too used to this.

319
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,380
To what?

320
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,715
This family.

321
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,926
It has come to my attention
that you and Trudy

322
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,220
are considering a child that's not your own.

323
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,930
Is this true?

324
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,350
It just came up.

325
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,268
How is that possible?

326
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,980
Peter, I would hate
to have to exclude you

327
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,066
from what is rightfully yours.

328
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,651
You have to keep at it.

329
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,904
You know what, Mother?

330
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,532
This is not a topic of conversation.

331
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,743
I think you know how your father felt
about the whole idea.

332
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,163
It's suitable for some.

333
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,874
But really, you're pulling from the discards.

334
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,627
My father?

335
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,546
- Yes.
- Pete.

336
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,467
Your husband spent everything you had.

337
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,139
Spent it with strangers.

338
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,682
All of it.

339
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,809
What are you talking about?

340
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,437
I'll messenger these
to your office tomorrow.

341
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,647
That's a swell idea.

342
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,442
The tone of your voice-- I don't like it.

343
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,986
That, too?

344
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,572
Stop being dramatic.

345
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,701
Bud, what is my fiduciary state?

346
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,828
Tell her.

347
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,958
Well. . .

348
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,336
We had to liquidate your holdings
to ensure your future comfort.

349
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,713
Why?

350
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,339
Who asked you to do that?

351
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,009
The market took a turn for the worse.

352
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,678
Real estate?

353
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,430
I think I would have heard about that.

354
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,602
Yes, well, don't forget
to send those by my office.

355
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,120
Do you want me to
lay everything out for you?

356
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,831
lt's been a day.
I just want to go to sleep.

357
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,736
You're smoking like a chimney.

358
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,446
It gives you wrinkles, you know.

359
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,909
Good morning, everyone.

360
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,160
Gene.

361
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
Morning, Don.

362
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,333
I have some batter left.
Would you like some waffles?

363
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,669
No. This will be fine.

364
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,046
And coffee.

365
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,881
- Morning, everybody.
- Do you want breakfast?

366
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:40,924
No.

367
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,927
I had no idea.

368
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,388
Please, Judy, it's okay.

369
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,223
No, it's yours. I feel terrible.

370
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,393
I didn't know your mother promised it to you.

371
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,644
Really, Judy, it's okay.

372
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,312
I wish he hadn't brought it up with you.

373
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,647
I'm putting it over here.

374
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,985
Isn't Viola coming today?

375
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,194
Later.

376
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,072
There's no chance she'll miss you.

377
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,157
- Leave the dishes.
- Nonsense.

378
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,576
You look beautiful.

379
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,619
Thank you.

380
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,414
Now that you've fed me,
why don't we go upstairs?

381
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,124
Gene!

382
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,751
I'm fine.

383
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,212
I don't know what to say.
He's so mixed up.

384
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,338
Gene, you are mixed up.

385
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,840
You're mixed up.

386
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,678
He's tired. He didn't sleep last night.

387
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,471
Of course.

388
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,353
Dad, you have to go back to the doctor.

389
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,522
I already have an appointment for Monday.

390
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,907
So. . .Daddy, what would you
like to do today?

391
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,492
Finish that puzzle?

392
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,745
Sure.

393
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,122
And maybe drive into town.

394
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,957
Get you a milkshake.

395
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,376
That's a grand idea.

396
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,603
Come in.

397
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,315
Finally.

398
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,859
I told her to call you.

399
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,611
You should have called me.

400
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,737
Hello, Viola.

401
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,326
And you two look good, considering.

402
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,535
How are the children?

403
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,787
They're good.

404
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,499
I'm gonna make some calls.

405
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,754
You should be here every day.

406
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,631
That's not up to me.

407
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,343
Why not?
You've been here longer than her.

408
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,011
He needs you.

409
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,596
I don't know about that.

410
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,308
And you let Gloria and Judy
ransack the house.

411
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,769
You want to give me your temper?

412
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,198
He doesn't know who I am.

413
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,534
He's very, very sick.

414
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,041
You don't know how nice it is
to hear someone say that.

415
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,387
Is he dying?

416
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,933
I was at Elkins Park Hospital on Sunday
when they talked to her.

417
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,687
It's just gonna get worse.

418
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,025
I don't know how much more I can take.

419
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,320
Well, this day comes eventually,
like it or not.

420
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,784
I'm an orphan.

421
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,330
You are supposed
to take care of your husband

422
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,041
and your beautiful children now.

423
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,377
They are yours.

424
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,547
You'll see.

425
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,050
The minute you leave,
you'll remember him

426
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,761
exactly the way he used to be.

427
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,725
It's all good outside that door.

428
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,194
Want these upstairs?

429
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,363
No. l haνe to put it all in the wash.

430
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,991
I'll go get the kids.

431
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,452
Francine promised them
the pool tomorrow.

432
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,579
Carla will bring them home later.

433
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,875
I'm gonna take a shower.

434
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,043
Don.

435
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,795
What?

436
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,590
I think you should leave.

437
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,468
Really?

438
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,136
Yes.

439
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,974
Bets, you're upset.

440
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,809
I am.

441
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,395
And I know how you feel about grieving.

442
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,691
I think I should be here for you.

443
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,861
That's your reason.

444
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,989
What do you want me to say?

445
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,494
I want to be here.

446
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,205
You need me here.

447
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,332
Why?

448
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,584
Nothing's changed.

449
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,128
We were just pretending.

450
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,070
Good afternoon, Mr. Draper.

451
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,780
Hello, Donna.

452
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,864
Allison.

453
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,075
Of course.

454
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,686
Surprise!

455
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,533
And this beautiful layette.

456
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,286
We've also attempted
to fortify your castle.

457
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,955
Lucky Strike, Martinson Coffee,

458
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,459
Pampers, and some Clearasil,
for when it gets bigger.

459
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,794
You raided the storeroom for me.

460
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,756
Now, Daddy-o, we've given
this a lot of thought.

461
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,426
You are going to be blessed
with a stinking miracle.

462
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,761
Stop it!

463
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,222
So, in assessing the damage
to your private life,

464
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,600
we've gotten you some reading material.

465
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,061
What do you get for the man
who's about to have nothing?

466
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,605
- No, no, no, no.
- Speech, speech.

467
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,443
I'm very touched by this party.

468
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,486
That's the whole point.

469
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,029
You're not going to be touched.

470
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,699
I got it, Paul. Knock it off.

471
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,869
I want to toast all of you.

472
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,331
And let's hope when this baby comes
that he likes Luckys.

473
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,334
Here's to the little one,
whatever it may be.

474
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,586
- Cheers.
- Salut.

475
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,759
I just wanted to say Happy Birthday.

476
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,601
What's this?

477
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,561
Tiffany's?

478
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,772
Who's it from?

479
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,148
From Jane.

480
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,275
And Roger, I'm sure.

481
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,072
Will you cut the cake, dear?

482
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,410
Mr. Draper.

483
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,744
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

484
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,829
How is everything?

485
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,748
About how those things are.

486
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,668
Joan, if you don't mind,
can I borrow you for a moment?

487
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,336
- Of course.
- Thank you.

488
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,763
Thank you.

489
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,184
And you have your meeting
with Mr. Odino at 1 0 tomorrow.

490
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,563
And then Lee Garner, Jr.
and the TV department at 3.

491
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,981
Cancel everything.

492
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,858
Yes, of course.

493
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,192
Reschedule for Friday?

494
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,028
No. Clear the week.

495
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:45,825
So. How was your family emergency?

496
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,077
Memorable. Thank you.

497
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,371
I assume that means everything's okay?

498
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,876
I'm leaving for California tomorrow
for the Rocket Fair.

499
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,711
Good for you.

500
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,880
Sunshine, bikinis.

501
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,217
But didn't we already send a couple men?

502
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,386
Campbell and Kinsey?

503
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,054
Not yet.

504
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,726
WelI, Campbell has got to go.

505
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,020
I've held his hand through 30 phone calls.

506
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,899
Very good, Don.
Bring me a bag of oranges.

507
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,027
I'm sure Joan here can hold down the fort.

508
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,029
She's been doing it so far.

509
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:26,324
Told you you'd be in good hands
with Miss Holloway.

510
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:38,336
I'll need you to send a memo to Mr. Kinsey
explaining this change in plans.

511
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,422
I'll take care of it.

512
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,008
You look like you didn't
get any sleep last night.

513
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,969
I did.

514
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,763
Go ahead. Lay down.

515
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,765
I'll keep the drunks away.

516
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,732
l heard it's very hard
to get anything done there

517
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,067
because of the weather, you know?

518
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,109
People don't work.

519
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,653
Sounds good to me.

520
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,364
I'm sure l'll be going sometime
in the next few months.

521
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,532
All the networks keep saying

522
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,117
how l need to come out
and shave my face.

523
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,286
I mean show.

524
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,996
What's in this?

525
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,041
You're just gonna fly off
and Ieave your wife and newborn?

526
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,300
I just want to say
that I am so happy for you

527
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,303
and that you're gonna be the best father

528
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,597
and that I'm really happy for you.

529
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,599
Thank you.

530
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,571
- Mr. Kinsey?
- Yes, Joan.

531
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,699
Mr. Draper wanted you to be informed
that he will be going to Los Angeles

532
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,033
for the convention.

533
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,494
Great. We won't have to fly tourist.

534
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,289
No. It's just he and Mr. Campbell going.

535
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,832
What?

536
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,458
Don's going with Pete?

537
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,919
He can't do that.

538
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,172
I'm sure it must be disappointing.

539
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,632
I'll need your tickets and your badges.

540
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,552
That's not right. Why can't we all go?

541
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,762
I really need everything right away.

542
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,514
Or are they at home?

543
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,648
Is there any cake left?

544
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,276
Hey, Sheila. It's me.

545
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,362
No, l know that.

546
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,948
And I want you to know
I've thought about it--

547
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,117
Let me finish.

548
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,911
I'm going to stand there
arm-in-arm with you

549
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,747
and make a stand.

550
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,792
It's not just about you and me.

551
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,421
I know that.

552
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,177
No one's been shot lately. Okay?

553
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,514
I love you, too, baby.

554
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,819
Peggy.

555
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,906
May l speak with you?

556
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,913
Heck of a party.

557
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,082
Yes.

558
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,833
I'm going away, you know.

559
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,585
Of course.

560
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,213
On a plane.

561
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,547
What do you want me to say?

562
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,007
That I wish I was going?

563
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,218
Everybody does.

564
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,303
I've never even been on a plane.

565
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,931
Well, I have.

566
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,933
But not since my father died.

567
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,271
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm not scared.

569
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,359
It just seems significant, is all.

570
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,319
Statistically speaking,

571
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,196
it's very unlikely that it will happen

572
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,657
to two people in one family.

573
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,285
That's true.

574
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,455
Besides, it wouldn't be the worst thing.

575
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,374
Excuse me?

576
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,001
I hate my mother.

577
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,795
What do you think of that?

578
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,881
Come on, you must have an opinion.

579
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,592
I don't know the circumstances.

580
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,095
I don't know what l should expect from her.

581
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,138
I don't know her.

582
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,056
Like Bud and I turned out so great.

583
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,769
Who's to say it wouldn't be better?

584
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,896
So it's not yours. That could be good.

585
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:29,316
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,902
But I think your flight will be fine.

587
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,573
You should go home.

588
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,327
Everything's so easy for you.

589
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,956
It's not easy for anyone, Pete.

590
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,255
Have a great trip.

591
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,557
What's there?

592
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,982
Glen?

593
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,528
What are you doing?

594
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,405
Nothing.

595
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,951
How long have you been out here?

596
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,036
I don't know.

597
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,746
A few days.

598
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,085
What happened?

599
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,800
I didn't know if l was
going to see you again.

600
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,386
And then you weren't even home.

601
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,014
Did you run away?

602
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,269
So?

603
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,407
I think you should tell me what happened.

604
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,618
My dad wants Charlotte
and me to live with him.

605
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,828
My mom doesn't care.

606
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,163
I'm sure that's not true.

607
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,625
She just wants to be with her boyfriends.

608
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,712
Does she have a lot of boyfriends?

609
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,131
I guess.

610
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,216
They give me things.

611
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,389
I haven't seen you in so long,
except driving down the street.

612
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,060
I know. I know.

613
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,647
Can l use the bathroom?

614
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,901
Do you want me to wash your clothes?

615
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,593
Is that shirt okay?

616
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,720
That almost fits you.

617
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,690
Go ahead.

618
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,741
Why are you alone here?

619
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,243
It's the middle of the day.

620
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,621
It's lousy.

621
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,168
You understand why your mother
was mad at me, I hope.

622
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,379
Yeah.

623
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,798
Because she doesn't understand.

624
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,177
That's true.

625
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,475
I'm not going home.

626
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,644
Because l know l'm a problem for them.

627
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,229
Glen.

628
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,065
I know I am because
they keep saying I'm not.

629
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,275
Did you do something?

630
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,735
No.

631
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,822
But my mom is never home.

632
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,157
My dad has another baby.

633
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,034
His wife is pretty mean.

634
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,371
Where's your mother?

635
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,873
I don't know.

636
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,917
Writing pamphlets and handing them out.

637
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,046
I'm pretty responsible.

638
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,924
I brush my sister's teeth
and put us both to bed.

639
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,677
That's very sweet of you.

640
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,392
Aren't you going to eat?

641
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,627
Can l tell you something?

642
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,671
Of course.

643
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,256
I don't like ham.

644
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,634
I don't like meat at all, actually.

645
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,305
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,600
Do you want me to make you
some macaroni and cheese?

647
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,253
I came to rescue you.

648
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,924
Did you bring your cape?

649
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,676
I'm not joking.

650
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,970
We can go anywhere. I have money.

651
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,643
Glen. . .

652
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,695
- Mommy! I missed you!
- Mommy!

653
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,615
I missed you, too.

654
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,534
How is he?

655
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,369
- Who?
- Your father.

656
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,038
He's not good.

657
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,957
Carla, this is Glen Bishop.

658
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,877
Sally, Bobby, you remember
Glen from down the street.

659
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,379
Hi, Glen.

660
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,463
Hi.

661
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:10,300
Why don't you take Glen upstairs
and show him the trains Daddy got you?

662
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,553
You can use the controls.

663
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,473
Go ahead. lt's okay.

664
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,150
What's he doing here?

665
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,411
You're really bad.

666
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,079
You think you can do any better?

667
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,832
If l couldn't, I'd give up trying.

668
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,546
What don't you like
about the speed shear?

669
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,513
Glen, can you come in here?

670
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,105
Glen, get over here now.

671
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,149
I was worried sick.

672
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,568
Glen, you have to go home.

673
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,707
You can't do things like this.

674
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,711
Let's go. Your father's on his way.

675
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,214
I hate you.

676
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,673
Apologize right this minute.

677
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,592
No, it's true.

678
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,636
I hate you.

679
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,430
I know.

680
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,561
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,249
Come on. Let's wash up for dinner.

682
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,546
Advertising, if anything,
helps bring on change.

683
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,883
The market-- and l'm talking
in a purely Marxist sense--

684
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,970
dictates that we must include everyone.

685
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,806
The consumer has no color.

686
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:38,615
Betty, I'm sorry, but we really need to talk.

687
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,746
There's nothing to talk about.

688
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,709
I don't know why he was oνer here,
but this has to stop.

689
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,049
Nothing's going on.

690
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,554
Except that Glen feels alone.

691
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,056
Honestly, I don't blame him.

692
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,309
What did he say?

693
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,145
Nothing.

694
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,440
But it's obvious.

695
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,650
He depends on you for everything.

696
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,195
You're supposed to be taking care of him.

697
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,989
You're his mother.

698
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,699
And he gets nothing.

699
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,872
I thought with Dan out of our lives,
it would be different.

700
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,918
Glen's right.

701
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,463
I'm not a very good mother anymore.

702
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,768
Don isn't living here.

703
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,525
I'm sorry.

704
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:00,072
We haven't told the children.

705
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,241
Is it over?

706
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,788
I don't even know.

707
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,957
That's the worst.

708
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,751
Do they see him?

709
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,545
He takes them to dinner.

710
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:21,760
They don't know what made them
so speciaI all of the sudden.

711
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,137
I don't know.

712
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:28,141
For me, it wasn't that different
without him there.

713
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,649
Sometimes I feel like I'll float away

714
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,527
if Don isn't holding me down.

715
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:49,329
The hardest part
is realizing you're in charge.

716
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,178
As you can see, the pilot has turned off
the "No Smoking" sign.

717
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:09,307
We're expecting clear skies
en route to Los Angeles today.

718
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,809
It should be a pleasant day,

719
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:15,063
82 degrees and clear,
with a light Santa Ana wind.

720
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:18,191
Trans World Airlines. . .
