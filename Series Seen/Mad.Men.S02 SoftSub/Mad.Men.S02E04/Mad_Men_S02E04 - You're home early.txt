You're home early.

It's Good Friday.

How did it go?

It didn't.

Bobby, stop playing with the robot.

Do you want to talk about it?

No.

How was your day?

My father called. He's doing better.

He and William played golf yesterday.

William made a show of paying for it.

Bobby, what did I just say?

It was a accident.

You don't listen. Don, do something.

Is that what you wanted?

You take no responsibility
for anything that goes on in this house.

I pay the bills,
put clothes on your back,

your damn stables.

Don't you dare.

I'm here all day.

Alone with them, outnumbered.

What about Carla?
Doesn't she count?

It's not her job to raise our children!

I'm here, and then you come home
and get to be the hero.

You want me to bring home

what I got at the office today?

I'll put you through that window.

Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.

Bobby, it's not a good time.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

Dads get mad sometimes.

Did your daddy get mad?

He did.

What did your daddy look like?

Like me.

But bigger.

What did he like to eat?

Ham.

And this candy.

It tasted like violets.

Had a beautiful purple
and silver package.

What did he do?

I told you. He was a farmer.

But he died.

A long time ago.

We have to get you a new daddy.

Come here.

You have nothing to say?

What do you want to hear?

Something.

Anything.

How about you're going
to help raise these children,

not be one?

Bets,

you do whatever you want.

It's not about what I do.

He's a little kid.

My father beat
the hell out of me.

All it did was
make me fantasize

about the day
I could murder him.

I didn't know that.

And I wasn't half
as good as Bobby.
