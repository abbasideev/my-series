1
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,062
Afraid you'Il fall in love?

2
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,107
Something like that.

3
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,151
WelI, I can see you have good taste.

4
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,736
This is the one.

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,196
1 962 Coupe de Ville.

6
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,115
Does everything but make breakfast.

7
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,950
What are you in now?

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,952
I had a Dodge.

9
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,122
Those are wonderful
if you want to get somewhere.

10
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,166
This is for when you've already arrived.

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,959
Is that right?

12
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,502
Of course, someone like you,

13
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,963
you don't need to see yourself in a Cadillac.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,923
You're walking about in one every day.

15
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,052
How'd you like your car to look like that?

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,513
Look at you.

17
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,599
I bet you'd be as comfortable in one of these

18
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,559
as you would in your own skin.

19
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,063
Wayne Kirkby. Do you have a card?

20
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,277
Sterling Cooper.

21
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,987
Did Roger Sterling send you?

22
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,989
Yes.

23
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,867
Let me go and get the keys, Mr. Draper.

24
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,765
Don't you want to hold onto these?

25
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,309
I don't know. The '49 rattled.

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,436
This is the 1 950 model.

27
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,021
It's quite different under the hood.

28
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,397
Don't talk to me.

29
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,024
Talk to him. It's his money.

30
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,275
I'm just here to make sure

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,110
you don't shake his hand
and take his fingers.

32
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,950
Charlie, this car is two years old
with only 25,000 miles on it.

33
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,785
It's what you want.

34
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,956
This must be Mrs. Wheatley.

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,375
No.

36
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,884
Why don't you sit in it again?

37
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,344
You two talk.

38
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,764
May l help you, ma'am?

39
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,725
Are you Donald Draper?

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,853
Yes, I am.

41
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,564
If it's about my circular,
many of the models are gone,

42
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,400
but l'm sure we can find you something.

43
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:16,028
I'm not here to buy a car.

44
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,364
You're a hard man to find.

45
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,782
Excuse me?

46
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,911
You're not Don Draper.

47
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,956
Mr. Draper?

48
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,085
Everything okay?

49
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,545
Yes.

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,381
Let me take you for a ride.

51
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,632
No.

52
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,385
Thank you.

53
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,220
I don't hear that a lot.

54
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,097
Well.

55
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,599
Have a good day.

56
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,406
Good afternoon, Miss Siegal.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,658
Mr. Sterling.

58
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,243
Is your boss in?

59
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,329
No, but he will be.

60
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,122
Where'd you get that sweater?

61
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,666
l want to make sure
my daughter never buys it.

62
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,127
Klein's.

63
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,337
I doubt your daughter shops there.

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,131
Union Square, right?
Is that where you live?

65
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,884
I've told you, all you have to do
is look at my file.

66
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,719
That's cheating.

67
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,140
How was your lunch, Mr. Draper?

68
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,141
Good.

69
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,267
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

70
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,145
Get Mr. Phillips.

71
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,065
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett called again.

72
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,149
Did she leave a message?

73
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,150
No.

74
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,320
ShalI I tell Mr. Phillips you returned?

75
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,238
Yes.

76
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,703
I'll bet she suffers in silence out there,
hoping you'll notice her.

77
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,165
I don't think she cries at night
from lack of attention.

78
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,875
Wait till she finds out about your Cadillac.

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,336
She'll be waiting naked
right in front of this window.

80
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,382
Now you're thinking about her.

81
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,175
Didn't you go see Wayne?

82
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,637
I'm going to eliminate
your objections right away.

83
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,263
First of all, you can afford it.

84
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,809
Do you know how invigorating it is

85
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,521
to go in and write a check for $6,500
and not care?

86
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,189
Secondly,

87
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,692
not to get too deep
before the cocktail hour,

88
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:22,196
but do I need to remind you
of the finite nature of life?

89
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,865
Mr. Phillips.

90
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,410
Send him in.

91
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,203
Like the song says, enjoy yourself.

92
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,454
It's later than you think.

93
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,207
Martinson Coffee.

94
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,709
Martinson's.

95
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,918
They changed it.

96
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,211
Change it back.

97
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,256
Jim Van Dyke told the people at Grey
they're under review.

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,008
So Grey must be scrambling.

99
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,718
It's hard for them to do a lot of new work.

100
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,346
They just redesigned labels,
displays, and dropped the S,

101
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,598
but they have some kids
working on print and TV.

102
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,225
Are they better than our kids?

103
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,977
We'll find out.

104
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,228
WelI, you're welcome.

105
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,938
I spent Saturday birding with that man,

106
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,690
and by birding l mean sitting on a stump

107
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,358
with a pair of binoculars, whispering.

108
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,236
Did you see anything unusual?

109
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,947
A refrigerator floating in a pond.

110
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,242
Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith are here.

111
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,493
Just a minute.

112
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,078
Did you let them stay up late?

113
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,248
- I'd love to hear this.
- l don't know.

114
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,001
If l fill you full of any more
confidence, you'll burst.

115
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,258
You don't dance,
or you don't dance with me?

116
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,260
Leave her alone. Let's go.

117
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,720
Heard you're gonna knock 'em dead.

118
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,023
Look, Don, it's pretty clear
why we're here.

119
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,941
You want to know
how our generation feels.

120
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,985
Okay.

121
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,863
So, I get this letter
from my friend back in Michigan.

122
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,823
He's still in school, man,

123
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,366
and it's got this, I don't know,

124
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,910
60-page rant in it.

125
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,829
So dig it.

126
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,707
"We would replace power

127
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,752
"rooted in possession,
privilege, or circumstance

128
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,670
"by power and uniqueness

129
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,839
"rooted in Iove, reflectiveness,

130
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,217
reason, and creativity."

131
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,302
That's a beautiful sentiment.

132
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,262
Does your friend know
what you do for a living?

133
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,057
Yeah, there was a shitty note with it,

134
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:17,269
but this whole concept is deep.

135
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,860
"Students for a Democratic Society."

136
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,570
That's a hell of a focus group.

137
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,323
It's how our generation feels.

138
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,783
It is what it is.

139
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,080
It's idealistic.

140
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,331
That's nice.

141
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,333
Your generation wants to talk

142
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,336
about that newly designed can
and the premium beans,

143
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,380
but we don't want to be told
what we should do

144
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,756
or how we should act.

145
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,842
We just want to be.

146
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,887
You just want to be
selling Martinson's Coffee?

147
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,764
Just listen to this.

148
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,735
So, the thought is,

149
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,072
every maternity ward will get a visit
from a registered nurse

150
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,658
with a doll and a crate of Pampers,

151
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,036
and she will extol their virtues,
which are many.

152
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,538
What did Draper say?

153
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,956
He liked it,

154
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,500
but he said the same thing
he keeps saying.

155
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,627
I can't get them to lower the price.

156
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,839
Do you know the years of R&D
P&G put into this?

157
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,174
Besides, they're worth it.

158
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,426
No boiIing, no diaper service,
no plastic pants.

159
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,887
And the greatest benefit of all,
you can throw them away.

160
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,054
1 0 cents apiece,

161
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,681
you kind of think you should reuse them.

162
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,310
Mr. Draper went over these ideas

163
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,353
and had thoughts he would
like you all to discuss.

164
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,692
WelI, it's 5:00. Are we going out?

165
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,818
I don't know, sweetheart.

166
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:48,903
Maybe.

167
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,279
I'll take those papers.

168
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,405
Good night, Miss Olson.

169
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,491
Jane, would you mind
helping us clean this up?

170
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,412
I'm meeting with Cooper tomorrow.

171
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,706
He said he wants to see me and only me.

172
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,291
Isn't that from West Side Story?

173
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,419
You know he's going
to ask you about the picture.

174
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,879
What picture?

175
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,422
Some new painting.

176
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,966
He calls people in to see what they think.

177
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,387
No, I think we're going to discuss
expanding the television department.

178
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,431
I heard it cost $1 0,000.

179
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,225
How does everybody know about this?

180
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,976
Are you making it up?

181
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,687
Last year, Harry went up to the roof
looking for cosmonauts.

182
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:26,982
Has anyone seen it?

183
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,525
Dale.

184
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,946
It's abstract expressionist.

185
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,530
What the hell does that mean?

186
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,116
Thank you all for ruining this.

187
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,661
You're the one who walked
to the opposite end of the office

188
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,371
to tell us you had a meeting.

189
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,249
Well, if you're lucky,
you'Il have a meeting.

190
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,043
And I'm not going to telI you anything
about the damn picture.

191
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,545
Why don't you just go look at it?

192
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,009
I'm sorry, Jane,

193
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,011
but you just don't walk
into his office like that.

194
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,429
But he's gone for the day.

195
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,014
That doesn't matter.

196
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,517
Miss Blankenship won't mind .

197
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,979
I'm going to go up and see it.

198
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,860
I'll go anywhere you go.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,750
WelI, she's gone.

200
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,502
What are you doing?

201
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,088
It's open.

202
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,924
Are you suicidal? Let's go.

203
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,010
I can't believe you all.

204
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,597
Take off your shoes.

205
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,351
I feel like we're skinny dipping.

206
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,811
Call me from jail.

207
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,605
You're gonna keep a lookout?

208
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,034
Just don't touch anything.

209
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,493
It's a Rothko.

210
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,120
Why the hell didn't Dale say that?

211
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,499
$1 0,000.

212
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,546
So it's smudgy squares?

213
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,548
That's interesting.

214
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,675
Two possibilities--

215
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,552
either Cooper loves it,

216
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,679
and you have to love it,

217
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,558
like in an "Emperor's New Clothes" situation,

218
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,018
or he thinks it's a joke

219
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,228
and you'll look like a fool
if you pretend to dig it.

220
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,565
People like him pretend
they understand this.

221
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,069
Maybe he has a brochure in here,
something that explains it.

222
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,570
I don't think it's supposed to be explained .

223
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm an artist, okay?

224
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,158
It must mean something.

225
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,701
Maybe it doesn't.

226
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,787
Maybe you're just supposed
to experience it.

227
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,665
Because when you look at it,
you do feel something, right?

228
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,754
It's like looking into something very deep.

229
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,674
You could fall in.

230
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,387
That's true.

231
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,514
Did someone tell you that?

232
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,932
How could someone tell you that?

233
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,600
This is pointless. Let's go.

234
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,976
I'm ready.

235
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,743
Harry actually took the stairs.

236
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,497
We could have stolen it, couldn't we?

237
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,624
Who are you?

238
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,293
I was thinking I could write
a great short story about this--

239
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,879
you know, "The Day We Looked
at the Painting."

240
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,714
I'm a writer.

241
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,009
I thought you were an accountant.

242
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,636
Accounts.

243
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,430
I've been published.

244
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,557
The Atlantic Monthly, Parabolas.

245
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,226
That's right.
The story about the maple tree.

246
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,645
It was beautiful and sad.

247
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,689
Really? You read it?

248
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,023
Everybody read it.

249
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,733
People were jealous.

250
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,654
Where are you headed?
Are you hungry?

251
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,364
No. Good night.

252
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,172
So you're stilI working here.

253
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,507
You missed something,
my yellow-bellied friend.

254
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,260
Jane Siegal is a genuine thrill.

255
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,553
Breaking and entering.

256
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,555
I don't care about Jane.

257
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,599
Tell me about Coop's painting.

258
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,851
What about Mr. Cooper's painting?

259
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,110
Enjoy that.

260
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,778
Can l get another coffee here, please?

261
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,240
I'll tell you what I heard.

262
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,075
You, Mr. Cosgrove, and Jane

263
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,203
were in Mr. Cooper's office
looking at his painting.

264
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,705
Anything you'd like to correct?

265
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,874
Mind your own business.

266
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,465
I had nothing to do with it.

267
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,800
Thank you.

268
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,178
Nothing happened.

269
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,730
Look, if Kurt says we don't need artwork,
we don't need artwork.

270
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,106
Is that what Kurt said?

271
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,483
Is that what you said?

272
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,735
Don has his signature.

273
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,029
It's nice down here.

274
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,072
Hey.

275
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,573
Kenneth.

276
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,826
3:00, and he doesn't talk in the meeting.

277
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,040
How about last night?

278
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,833
Quite an adventure.

279
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,838
Listen, I was thinking about
what you said about my story,

280
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,550
about it being sad and beautiful?

281
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,512
You're not Iike everyone else around here.

282
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,557
I don't know if that's true.

283
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,436
Okay. Here goes.

284
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,855
Would you mind taking a look at this?

285
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,818
Are you kidding?

286
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,820
I don't want you to pull any punches.

287
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,113
Unless you hate it,

288
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,532
in which case, don't tell me.

289
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,866
I'm kind of fragile.

290
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,786
I'd be honored.

291
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,539
WelI, great, then.

292
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,374
Take your time.

293
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,543
Ken.

294
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,169
Yeah.

295
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,172
You know, I can probably
read it by Sunday,

296
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,799
and you can come over for dinner,

297
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,134
you know, with Kitty and I .

298
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,970
I know you need a home-cooked meal.

299
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,513
You have plans?

300
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,765
No.

301
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,309
Are you sure it's okay?

302
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,436
You want me to give this back?

303
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,612
Young people do not drink coffee,

304
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,488
and that can become a lifetime habit.

305
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,741
Now, we're aware

306
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,827
that unsuccessful attempts
have been made--

307
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,495
puppets and so forth--

308
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,123
to capture the attention of youth.

309
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,501
That's why we're here.

310
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,170
There's an old saying.

311
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,922
When one is in Indian country,

312
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,509
one needs a man who knows Indians.

313
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,636
Mr. Smith?

314
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,515
So.

315
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,601
Where do we start?

316
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,769
Joe Martinson.

317
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,895
Old cup of Joe.

318
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,271
They named it after him, right?

319
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,442
That's just ancient history now.

320
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,861
There have been a million ways
that the folks on this avenue

321
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,946
have tried to telI our generation what to do.

322
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,532
Except we don't want to be told what to do.

323
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,617
That's over.

324
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,623
We want to find things for ourselves.

325
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,625
We want to feel.

326
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,378
Okay.

327
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,005
Martinson's is a great coffee.

328
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,384
It's delicious, and it's hot, and it's brown.

329
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,886
That's all you need to say.

330
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,722
We don't need more than that.

331
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,265
Peggy. Sweetheart?

332
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,714
I don't know if I understand this.

333
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,924
It's a jingle, right?

334
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,052
It's a song, and it's a mood,

335
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,470
and it's a feeling.

336
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,889
It's definitely more than a jingle.

337
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,267
What do you think?

338
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,853
It stays with you.

339
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,190
What are the pictures that go with this?

340
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,276
If you sign, we'll tell you.

341
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,583
So Media Purchases.

342
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,044
Starting in March,
I'm looking at column 5,

343
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,922
under Regional Affiliates.

344
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,095
Mr. Crane, focus, please.

345
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,308
We didn't make you head of television
just to shorten your attention span.

346
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,559
I'm sorry, sir.

347
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,562
I was admiring your painting.

348
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,983
The eye is drawn to it.

349
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,111
It's very modern.

350
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,530
Mark Rothko. I've read about him.

351
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,073
And?

352
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,160
What do you think about it?

353
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,916
Nobody has ever asked me that.

354
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,797
Probably because it's none of their business.

355
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,049
Right.

356
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,303
How does it strike you?

357
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,266
Sir, I know nothing about art.

358
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,895
Mr. Crane, you're here because of numbers.

359
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,021
Stick to that.

360
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,233
Don't concern yourseIf with aesthetics.

361
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,027
You'll get a headache.

362
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,487
Of course.

363
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,913
People buy things
to realize their aspirations.

364
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,582
It's the foundation of our business.

365
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,795
But between you and me
and the lamppost,

366
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,383
that thing shouId double
in value by next Christmas.

367
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,055
Where were we?

368
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,225
Column 5 here--
Regional Newspaper Affiliates.

369
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,648
Your hair is turning green.

370
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,358
You have to wear the bathing cap.

371
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,151
It squeezes my head .

372
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,077
Don't leave your wet suit on the floor.

373
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,370
Draper residence.

374
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,747
Is this the belle of the Hudson River Valley?

375
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,083
Who is this?

376
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,168
It's Jimmy Barrett, sweetheart.

377
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,171
Mr. Barrett.

378
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,800
Are you Iooking for Don?

379
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,427
Because he's at the office.

380
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,847
I know exactly what I'm doing.

381
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,768
ABC picked up Grin and Barrett,
my TV show, 39 episodes.

382
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,230
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

383
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,190
We're having a shindig at the Stork Club.

384
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,567
Donnie didn't get back to me,

385
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,193
so I figured if you're anything like my wife,

386
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,612
you book the dance card.

387
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,948
Monday night,
so the celebrities can come.

388
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,533
That sounds like fun,

389
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,119
but celebrities make me shy.

390
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,704
Keep playing that, gorgeous.

391
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,247
It works wonders.

392
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,792
I'll talk to Don about it.

393
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,544
Don't you want to go?

394
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,130
You can't leave me alone
with those people.

395
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,466
Ride the horse in, like Lady Godiva.

396
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,428
I think I should hang up now.

397
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,846
Betty,

398
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,516
it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

399
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,562
We wiIl try. Have a nice day, Jimmy.

400
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,778
Mr. Phillips.

401
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,866
Right now there's a little boy

402
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,409
running over here from Martinson Coffee

403
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,161
with a check in his hand.

404
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,456
It's done. Congratulations.

405
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,876
Thanks.

406
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,503
You want me to send
for something for you?

407
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,171
No, but don't let me
dampen your spirits.

408
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,090
Unfurl the sails, please.

409
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,637
That was good advance work.

410
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,098
That's my job.

411
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,266
Maybe we'll get a shot at LifeSavers.

412
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,355
Mr. Cooper wants to speak with you.

413
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,233
We'll be right there.

414
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,319
He just asked for you, Mr. Draper.

415
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,540
Thanks again.

416
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,637
CongratuIations, Don.

417
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,305
Sit with us.

418
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,642
Thank you.

419
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,477
But I didn't do it alone.

420
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,813
Fascinating.

421
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,066
Jim Van Dyke of Martinson Coffee
was thoroughly impressed.

422
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,526
He's inviting you to join the board

423
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,070
of the Museum of Early American Folk Arts.

424
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,572
That's nice.

425
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,865
What is it?

426
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,324
Doesn't exist yet.

427
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,244
But I've seen the opening exhibit.

428
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,329
Whirligigs.

429
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,373
Do they need a campaign?

430
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,127
No. Philanthropy is the gateway to power.

431
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,546
If you say so.

432
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,257
We need you to continue
your excellence in advertising,

433
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,135
but also to start treating this
like part of a bigger business,

434
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,511
which it is.

435
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,389
I will.

436
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,225
Do you understand what this means?

437
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,398
You're going to be wearing
your tuxedo a lot more.

438
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,361
It's time for the horse to catch the carrot.

439
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,410
Roger, would you mind?

440
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:47,008
Would you agree that l know
a little bit about you?

441
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,303
A little.

442
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:56,476
There are few people who get to decide
what will happen in our world .

443
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:01,314
You have been invited to join them.

444
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:06,402
Pull back the curtain
and take your seat.

445
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,913
You're back.

446
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,040
I had a feeling.

447
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,376
You want to take it for a drive?

448
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,754
Wayne, I would like to buy this car.

449
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,011
Jane, would you come with me, pIease?

450
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,055
Is something wrong?

451
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,348
Just tell me.

452
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,433
You want to have this conversation here?

453
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,685
Fine.

454
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:43,148
You broke into Mr. Cooper's office
with some executives after hours.

455
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,483
That's not true.

456
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,154
I'm not in the habit
of making empty accusations.

457
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,408
They made me. l had no choice.

458
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,869
Please. They'll do anything you say.

459
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,453
You work for Mr. Draper.

460
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,456
What's wrong with you?

461
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,500
With me?

462
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,043
Yes.

463
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,963
Are you the only one who's allowed
to have fun around here?

464
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,256
What?

465
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,925
Please. I don't need a mother.

466
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,303
I'm 20 years old .

467
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,471
Collect your things.

468
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:16,848
What?

469
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,309
Get your things.

470
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,311
You can't be serious.

471
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,397
You want to have this conversation again
in front of Mr. Draper?

472
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,483
I'm going to the break room
to find your replacement.

473
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:31,070
See that you are gone
by the time I return.

474
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,998
Don!

475
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,918
You like it?

476
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,170
I don't know what to say.

477
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,047
It's gorgeous.

478
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,177
Slide over.

479
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,771
It's like the cockpit of a jet.

480
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,274
What's this for?

481
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,943
That is a headlight sensor.

482
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:13,738
It automatically dims the lights
as you approach another car.

483
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,200
And these seats.

484
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,786
It was expensive.

485
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,537
- Do you love it?
- I do.

486
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,582
WelI, you deserve it. You work so hard.

487
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:28,086
I can't wait to pull up
to the Stork Club in this.

488
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,088
Any time you want.

489
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,549
Monday night?

490
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,429
Jimmy Barrett's throwing
a party for his TV show.

491
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,139
He called for you.

492
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,474
He called here?

493
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,559
He should have gone
through my secretary.

494
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,772
I think he likes talking to me.

495
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,404
The kids won't be home for an hour.

496
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,572
Want to take her around the block?

497
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,664
Not in here.

498
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:23,933
Mr. Sterling?

499
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,729
I'm sorry. Ginger stepped away.

500
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,107
Well. Hello there.

501
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,653
I just wanted to say good-bye
and thank you for being so kind to me.

502
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,280
Good-bye?

503
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,117
I've been fired.

504
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,078
Draper's a tough desk, honey.

505
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,914
Actually, it was Miss Holloway.

506
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,046
I can see someone wanting
to reprimand you seriously.

507
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,631
But firing? It's a little permanent.

508
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,718
Do you want a drink?

509
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,887
Not like you work here anymore.

510
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,435
Would you Iike
to tell me what happened?

511
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,686
You don't need to bother with this.

512
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:09,937
I want to.

513
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm just trying to do my job.

514
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,445
Miss Holloway is. . .

515
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,448
WelI, she's going through a rough time.

516
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,657
She's engaged, you know.

517
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,452
Tell you what.

518
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,371
You go home--

519
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,663
Where do you live?

520
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,041
In the Village.

521
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,584
Jane Street.

522
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,002
Jane on Jane Street.

523
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,796
That's a pretty picture.

524
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,218
Listen, you go home
to your little apartment on Jane Street.

525
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,553
By the time you come back here
on Monday morning,

526
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,722
this will all be taken care of.

527
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,725
Are you sure?

528
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,435
No more tears.

529
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,772
I don't know what to say.

530
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,608
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
Thank you so much.

531
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,692
Roger.

532
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,629
That's my favorite tie.

533
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,132
He's late. I was expecting that.

534
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,591
He is a bachelor.

535
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,477
You could smell heaven in the street.

536
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,938
I'd like to take credit,
but it's all the maestro.

537
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,648
These are beautiful.

538
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,650
Don't forget to put
an aspirin in the bottom.

539
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,652
Keeps 'em fresh.

540
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,737
I know that. I told you that.

541
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,614
Can l offer you a drink?

542
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,658
Beer if you have it.

543
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,536
But wine with the spaghetti. Okay?

544
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,665
Your place is. . .really wild.

545
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,834
Once we decided not
to look for a bigger place,

546
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,711
we just Iet ourselves go.

547
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,673
How did you two meet?

548
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,008
It's a boring story.

549
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,301
No, it's not.

550
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,554
I grew up a block away from him
in Baltimore.

551
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,765
l guess I just always had
a crush on an older man.

552
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,061
As soon as I moved my mother up here,
Kitty came along.

553
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,063
Come, come. Taste this sauce.

554
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,402
Now, tell me what you think,
and be honest.

555
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,070
I'm fragile.

556
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,700
It's really good.

557
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,784
It's better than a restaurant.

558
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,250
I don't want this hanging in the air.

559
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,461
- What are you talking about?
- My story.

560
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,713
I don't want to sit here
the whole meal worrying

561
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,258
and then find out you didn't read it
or that you did and you didn't like it.

562
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,718
Are you kidding? I loved it.

563
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,720
- Loved what?
- His story.

564
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,265
Yes. He wouldn't stop talking about it,
but he won't let me read it.

565
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,892
I didn't know how you felt.

566
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,728
I wonder if one day
they'll rent this apartment

567
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,272
by bragging about the fact
that you ate here once.

568
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,816
I'm going to be eating here all the time.

569
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:05,821
To "The Gold Violin,"
by Kenneth Cosgrove.

570
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,830
You really liked it?

571
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,667
I did. It was lovely.

572
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,836
I saw one at the Met.

573
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,424
It's perfect in every way,
except it couldn't make music.

574
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,759
Oh, my.

575
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,095
Well, shall we?

576
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,698
Is Bobby in the car again?

577
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,700
No. He's running around.

578
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,038
So I don't understand.

579
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:00,376
You'd rather play checkers
than my "look at the clouds" game.

580
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,461
I'd rather play with Silly Putty.

581
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,797
I don't want it jammed between my seats.

582
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,968
You know what, Sally?
Go play with Bobby.

583
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,640
We should do this more often.

584
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,517
We should only do this.

585
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,814
I have to go pee-pee.

586
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,191
Go behind a tree there.
No one's looking.

587
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,823
I want to tinkle outside.

588
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,825
I don't know.

589
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,076
It's different for boys.

590
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,496
I think everybody should go
before we get in the car.

591
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:38,623
Do you have to go?

592
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,707
No.

593
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,127
You kids are lucky.

594
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,087
When l was a little boy,

595
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,757
back on the farm,

596
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,843
we had an outhouse
way out in the yard.

597
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,970
And on nights
when there was no moon,

598
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,096
there was this rope,

599
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,808
and you had to feeI for it in the dark
and pull yourself across.

600
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,561
I'm glad we didn't live in the olden days.

601
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,734
Are we rich?

602
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,073
It's not polite to talk about money.

603
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,660
I did it!

604
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,871
We should probably get going
if we don't want to hit traffic.

605
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,415
Sally, pack up the checkers.

606
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,932
Check their hands.

607
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,145
Okay.

608
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,981
You get the last of it.

609
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,524
Should I get another?

610
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,276
You can have mine.

611
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,112
Harry tell you anything about his meeting?

612
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,739
Harry's meeting with who?

613
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,198
Mr. Cooper.

614
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,950
He says he knows the answer now.

615
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,702
Well? What was it?

616
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,662
He says I wouldn't understand.

617
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,208
Where do you live, Ken?

618
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,752
Murray Hill.

619
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,713
I can waIk to the office, but I don't.

620
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,966
I wonder if you're gonna get a call.

621
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,510
I'm pretty sure he's going
through the whole roster.

622
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,597
Although, Cosgrove
comes before Crane, right?

623
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,309
My cousin has an advertising agency
in Montreal.

624
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,019
He's not interested in that.

625
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,314
How the heck did you
end up in accounts?

626
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,109
Me and a bunch of my college buddies
heard there was dough.

627
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,986
I was the only one who got a job.

628
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,988
What about writing?

629
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,573
That's just for fun.

630
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,659
It's your hobby.

631
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,420
I should go.

632
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,506
You can't.

633
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,108
Don't you want coffee?

634
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,112
Would it be rude to say that I have
a long ride back to Manhattan?

635
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,865
I can wrap up a piece of pie for you.

636
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,035
- It's pine nuts and pineapple.
- If I eat any more,

637
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,037
I'll burst.

638
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,956
You two have been wonderful.

639
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,544
Thanks for reading the story.

640
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,296
You can let her read it.

641
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,131
I can't wait.

642
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,140
I'll see you tomorrow, l guess.

643
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,320
Do you want to have some pie?

644
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,240
No. I'm not hungry.

645
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,825
I'm just going to clean up.

646
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,995
Do you even care that l want dessert?

647
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,039
Of course I do. I'll go get it.

648
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,541
I'll get it.

649
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,793
What's the matter, Kitty?

650
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,086
I don't work where you do.

651
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,088
I've met these people once.

652
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,591
How am l supposed to talk about them?

653
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,551
Come on, Kitty.

654
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,722
Do you even see me here?

655
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,515
Well, of course I do.

656
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,475
WelI, you wouldn't know it, Salvatore.

657
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,770
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,189
We were just talking about work.

659
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,193
You're right.

660
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,070
It was rude.

661
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,532
I tried to include myseIf.

662
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:27,077
A lot of people find me
very interesting, you know?

663
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,959
I am so sorry, Kitty.

664
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,135
It's okay.

665
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,723
I'll get you some pie.

666
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,475
You put your feet up.

667
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,226
I'll take care of the kitchen.

668
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,437
Okay.

669
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,515
I have tickets for the Mets tonight.

670
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,059
Great seats for probably a terrible game.

671
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,185
I'll be by at 5.

672
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,187
No, you won't,
and please don't lurk near my desk.

673
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,689
I'm being watched.

674
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,856
Okay.

675
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,276
WelI, have a good day.

676
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,699
Good morning.

677
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,368
Morning.

678
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,453
I was going to calI Kitty today,

679
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,205
but I don't know what
it's like with Italian people

680
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,623
if you call someone's wife.

681
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,125
It's okay.

682
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,002
Give her a call. She'd like that.

683
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,380
WelI, I just wanted to thank her--
both of you, really.

684
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,548
Every once in a while,

685
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,383
you wish you weren't
a bachelor, you know?

686
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,220
And your home is kind of
what l have in mind,

687
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,972
the way you two are.

688
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,225
WelI, we really enjoyed having you.

689
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,798
What on God's green earth
are you doing here?

690
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,514
Did Mr. Sterling speak with you?

691
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,932
No.

692
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,562
What could he possibly have to do with this?

693
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,192
I'll do whatever you want,
but he said that you do this a lot.

694
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,152
Do what?

695
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,279
Lose your temper.

696
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,115
That you're impetuous
and it's not serious.

697
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,832
And what were you doing
talking to Mr. Sterling?

698
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,293
I ran into him on my way out.

699
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,337
Did you?

700
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,966
Is there a problem?

701
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,219
No.

702
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,846
There's no problem at aIl.

703
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,681
It's very clear.

704
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,089
Everyone looks so glamorous.

705
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,384
Believe me,
they're saying that about you.

706
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,344
It's my earrings.

707
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,180
Do you remember? Bermuda?

708
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,390
I do.

709
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,767
Here he is.

710
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,352
Don Draper.

711
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,312
I heard you had something
to do with this.

712
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,772
Very little.

713
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,440
Betty, this is Andrew Colhold with ABC.

714
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,859
A pleasure to meet you.

715
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,110
And you.

716
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,445
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?

717
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,990
Hello, Mrs. Draper.
You look stunning.

718
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,241
Don.

719
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,826
Hello, Mrs. Barrett.

720
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,372
Don, did Andrew tell you my idea
for working a few items into the show?

721
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,999
Not yet.

722
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,375
Why don't I get us some drinks?

723
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,210
That's okay. Let me get them.

724
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,378
I'll do it.

725
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,840
No, it sounds like you three
have business to discuss.

726
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,344
For example,
a woman's parking her car,

727
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,222
and then Jimmy runs out and says
she's run over his Rolex watch,

728
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,808
so then we show the watch.

729
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,728
Of course Jimmy will need
a Rolex, I suppose.

730
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,982
I don't care, as long
as we bury Candid Camera.

731
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,492
If you're trying to blend
into the wall, you can't.

732
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,621
Hello, Jimmy.

733
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,206
Hello, gorgeous.

734
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,999
What are you doing
standing here all alone?

735
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,792
They're talking business.

736
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,044
I fled.

737
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,717
I'd better not.

738
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,344
I've had too much already.

739
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,387
I insist.

740
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,725
The drunker you are,
the funnier l become.

741
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,770
ABC did research.

742
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,441
Come on.
Let's keep each other company.

743
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,908
I wish l was a mosquito right now.

744
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,868
I would never leave you alone.

745
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,912
Come to think of it,
l never do, do I?

746
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,455
No, you don't.

747
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,374
I'd want you on my arm.

748
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,464
Look at us, over here at the kids' tabIe.

749
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,840
What do you mean?

750
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,009
Them. Your husband.

751
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,182
I've been standing behind guys
like that my whoIe life.

752
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,558
I was lucky I was funny.

753
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:27,145
If I wasn't funny,
I would never have gotten to meet you.

754
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,064
- That's not true.
- It is.

755
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,733
It's hard to believe
there's anything better than you.

756
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,486
Hard to believe he could do
any better than you .

757
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,029
Please stop.

758
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,410
What do you think happened
between the two of them?

759
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,745
Excuse me?

760
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,373
Oh, come on. Look at them.

761
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,508
I don't like what you're saying.

762
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,510
All I know is I know her,
and you know him,

763
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,721
and there they are,
and they don't care where we are.

764
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,763
Stop it.

765
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,765
- Hold on.
- Let me go.

766
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,226
I don't like it any more than you do.

767
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:12,190
You people are ugly and crude.

768
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,902
What people? You mean comedians?

769
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,660
. . .a very unusual emergency.

770
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,787
You know what must really annoy him?

771
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,498
All the interruptions
when we're not at home--

772
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,084
signing for deliveries,
answering the phone,

773
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,753
turning on the oven.

774
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,922
You know I never ask him
to do that sort of thing

775
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,383
unless it's impossible
for me to be here.

776
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,552
How about that Thanksgiving

777
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,554
when your car broke down
and Daddy had to leave his office

778
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,014
every 1 5 minutes to baste?

779
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,936
Your father never complains or anything.

780
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,189
WelI, no. Daddy wouldn't.

781
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,651
I guess he wouIdn't.

782
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,573
Leaving so soon?

783
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,824
We didn't get to talk.

784
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,576
Betty's not feeling well.

785
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,119
Too bad.

786
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,662
Here, let me get that.

787
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,539
It's the least I can do.

788
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,922
Thanks to you,
I got everything I wanted.

789
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,092
I don't know if that's possible, Jimmy.

790
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,593
I got my relationship with Utz,

791
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,721
my show, my money, 39 on the air.

792
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,057
I'm gonna be an institution.

793
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,309
I'll tell everyone I know.

794
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,603
You know what I like about you?
Nothing.

795
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,563
But it's okay.

796
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,482
You got me everything I wanted.

797
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,942
What did you get?

798
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,610
Bobbie?

799
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,612
Lots of people have had that.

800
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,489
Excuse me?

801
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,866
Please. I laugh at you.

802
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:48,078
I go home at night, and I laugh at you.

803
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,164
I don't know what you think happened.

804
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,961
You. You want to step out, fine.

805
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,629
Go to a whore.

806
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,215
You don't screw another man's wife.

807
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,800
You're garbage.

808
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,719
And you know it.

809
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,640
Well.

810
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,225
Good night, you two.

811
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,477
It's been a gas.

812
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,615
