110
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,558
Bank robbing. (exhales sharply)

What happened was, we met a moll

119
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:46,328
goes with one of them Cannon boys,
knew I was your sister.

120
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,638

121
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,896
who knows why.

122
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,245
So we decided to come bail you out.

123
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,213
Leg-breakers if you're lucky.

124
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:59,753

- Don't need your help.

How much interest he charging?

127
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,328
Ten percent the first month,
then it goes up from there.

128
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,962
Don't tell her that.

129
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,597

00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,274
Nothing's changed.

364
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,153
Have a nice visit.

365
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,935
Come here.

366
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,929
They feeding you?

367
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,185
Mostly peanut butter.

368
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,423
Where do you sleep?

369
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:10,366
He's got a room
on the third floor with me.

370
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,146
You seeing to his education?

371
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,243
I'm teaching him how the world works.

372
00:24:16,947 --> 00:24:18,209
And how's that?

373
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:20,467
It's dog eat dog.

374
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:26,547
That's how dogs work.
Men are more complicated.

375
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,746
Not in my experience.

376
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:33,714
You like staying here,
in the master's house?

377
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:36,125
He make you feel appreciated?

378
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,748
We live with the choices we make.

379
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,904
Consequences.

380
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,863
Who's the big Italian just off the boat?

381
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,128
It's Josto's brother, Gaetano.

382
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,341
Over from the boot.

383
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,675
- He staying?
- Not sure yet.

384
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,349
You'd tell me if they were taking my boy
out to the woodshed.

385
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:03,929
'Cause in my book, they say safe,

386
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:07,665
they mean sound. Unmolested.

387
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,816
Nobody interferes with the boy.

388
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,922
He's entirely in my keeping.

389
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:24,402
Your mama says eat your vegetables.

390
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:27,215
We love you and you're coming home.

391
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:28,488
When?

392
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:32,128
That I don't know.

393
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:34,907
Tell your boss we need to talk soon.

Yeah.

402
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:49,735
<i>DOCTOR SENATOR:
I called three more banks in the area.</i>

403
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,967
No one's biting on the credit card.

404
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:54,040
- You didn't tell 'em the idea?
- No.

405
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:57,829
But I stressed that this was
a groundbreaking financial instrument

406
00:26:57,831 --> 00:26:59,787
and they could be the first
on their block.

407
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,529
We keep this in the neighborhood,
just for us.

408
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:05,873
How do we know they don't burn down
the neighborhood

409
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,822
once we start to pave
the streets with gold?

410
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:10,127
We need their restaurants,

411
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,108
their department stores, their banks.

412
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,241
Last I checked, I couldn't even
try on clothes at Gimbels.

413
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,192
The brother came in from Italy.

414
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,139
Older or younger?

415
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:28,693
Younger.

416
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,135
But big.

417
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:36,278
Difference between a lion in the jungle
and a lion in a cage.

418
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,907
Tigers live in the jungle.
Lions are on the plains.

419
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,742
You're saying there could be
a power struggle?

420
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,880
- I...
- We should move now.

421
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:46,722
Expand before they get
their heads on straight.

422
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:49,564
Or it's a trick and they're trying
to make us spread thin.

423
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:50,673
So we test their flanks.

424
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:53,617
Start small, see what's the response.

425
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,240
Me and Donatello were talking about us

426
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:03,638
taking over the slaughterhouse
before he died.

427
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,630
He said yes.

428
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,049
- He said...
- Is our position.

429
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,812
We asked, he gave permission.

430
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:18,045
Now that's what we're doing.

431
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:24,204
I'll take Opal and his crew.

432
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,296
(sighs)

433
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:32,696
Meanwhile, you need to ask yourself

434
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:34,359
how far you're willing to go with this

435
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:37,059
in case it becomes a skirmish
or a battle or a war.

436
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:38,581
We're in a groove.

437
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:42,256
Money's coming in,
business is heating up.

438
00:28:42,258 --> 00:28:46,366
Maybe we get rich anyway, hmm?

439
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,461
Why stress the system?

440
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:53,529
(sighs)

441
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,851
You know who else is in a groove?

442
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:01,214
That lion in the cage.

443
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,874
He just wears it in the floor,

444
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,423
pacing back and forth.

445
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:09,407
Well, you know who's got no groove?

446
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:12,509
That lion with his head
hanging on the wall.

447
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,311
He's just hanging there

448
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:17,553
with nothing but the smile
they forced on his face.

449
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,985
My guess is they make a move.

450
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,692
Today, tomorrow. Test us.

451
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,179
(speaking Italian)

452
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:51,136
They are twisted.

453
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:53,339
These spooks.

454
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:55,589
The way they think.

455
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,083
Always with their hand out.

456
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:00,189

We're gonna respect the deal.

00:30:29,936 --> 00:30:32,225
That's, um...

465
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,252
What do Americans say?

466
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:36,400
Fine.

467
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:40,288
I'm here... few days.

468
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,498
Um...

469
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,545
if you want to be pussy, be pussy.

470
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:46,547
(knocking on door)

471
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,818
Josto.

472
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,615
- Sis, we're talking here.
- Your Dessie is here.

473
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:55,409
- In a minute.
- The alderman also.

474
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,799
They've come to pay respects.

475
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:02,371
_

476
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:11,490
No killing.

477
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:12,709
No.

478
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,880
(sputters) Pussy.

479
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:25,428

480
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:30,215
(indistinct chatter)

481
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:38,783
Oh, my darling. Is it awful?

482
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:40,023
- I'm managing.
- Oh.

483
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,529
- I have my family.
- Oh.

484
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:43,505
We're your family, too.
Isn't that right, Daddy?

485
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:46,591
- Not married yet.
- Oh, Daddy, don't be awful.

486
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:48,683
Do you need anything. Are you eating?

487
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:51,974
I'm, uh... what do you... copacetic.

488
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,067
Men. Always acting so Humphrey Bogart.

489
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:57,477
You go ahead and cry if you need to.

490
00:31:57,479 --> 00:32:00,054
A boy losing his father,
nobody's gonna judge.

491
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:03,083
Sugar plum, give Daddy a minute
with your fiancé.

492
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:04,707
I want to hand him some words of wisdom.

493
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:08,654
We'll talk later, honey bear. Okay?

494
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,493
Kiss-kiss, kiss?

495
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:19,365
Am I getting fucked here?

496
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,852
Slow your roll.

497
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:22,334
'Cause the only reason
I'm letting my daughter

498
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:23,759
marry some guinea greaser

499
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:26,513
is that I got ambitions:
political, financial...

500
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:28,762
And here I am, hopelessly in love.

501
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:30,800
Go fuck a state park.

502
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:32,964
You ain't getting a piece
of the Gillis legacy

503
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:36,246
until I got assurances
you can deliver votes.

504
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:40,007
Mayors don't elect themselves,
and elections aren't free.

505
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:43,309
Dad? Can I call you Dad?

506
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,576
My pop didn't claw his way out
of the plebeian dynasty

507
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:49,808
so that his sons could end up
in middle management.

508
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,430
You want to be mayor?
I want my kids to be president.

509
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,972
So I'll get you your votes
and your, uh...

510
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:57,981
<i>bustarella.</i>

511
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:08,113
But first I'm gonna slow-pump
some babies into your daughter

512
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:11,431
one at a time and twice on Sundays.

513
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:15,726
Now get a drink.

514
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:18,408
And try the calzone. They're a riot.

515
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:21,954
<i>ODIS: Condolences.</i>

516
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:28,063
I noticed the blue Ford
parked out front.

517
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:30,675
Congratulations. You got eyes.

518
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:33,480
Witness at the private hospital
saw a blue Ford

519
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:35,311
fleeing from the scene of the homicide.

520
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,403
Blue is a popular color.

521
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:39,807
You're not curious who got whacked?

522
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,471
You see all the black suits
when you walked in?

523
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:45,006
Ladies crying into their meatballs?

524
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:50,839
And what if I said I've been tipped
to some s-swarthy Lotharios

525
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,365
that got jacked from the premises
a few days prior?

526
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:56,540
JOSTO: Is he dead?

527
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:58,276
Who?

528
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,726
You know who, you twitchy piece of shit.

529
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,109
Is he dead?

530
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:16,750
Boss.

531
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:20,220
Boss, boss, boss, boss.

532
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,625
You can't shoot civilians.

533
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,800
That fucking guy
put my family on the street

534
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:27,108
like we were shit on his spats.

535
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,462
He lost his breathing license.

536
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:34,076
(chuckling):
I know... but him you missed.

537
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:37,058
And now I got a wealthy socialite
what eats meals with the mayor

538
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,655
sporting a fresh hole in her head.

539
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:41,912
A... And top brass measuring my asshole

540
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,458
like they're fixing to move in.

541
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:46,413
No, sorry, I-I came in to ask,

542
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:47,788
respectfully...

543
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:51,620
I-I can guide this
a different direction...

544
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,227
find a patsy to frame up,

545
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:56,387
but you got to lay off this Dr. Harvard.

546
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,508
What'd you say to me?

547
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,713
- We won't touch him.
- Says you.

548
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:02,132
This year we don't touch.

549
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,182
Next year.

550
00:35:04,594 --> 00:35:06,600
He goes back to his ordinary life,

551
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:10,262
the fat <i>moglie,</i> his pot roast.

552
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,331
Builds his model airplanes. Forgets.

553
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,725
But we don't forget. We wait.

554
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,876
We sharpen our teeth.

555
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:24,190
And one day, when he can't even remember
that old woman's name...

556
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:26,563
well...

557
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,031
I won't speculate on coincidence
in front of an officer of the law.

558
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:35,219
But you got assurances
this thing is over.

559
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:37,274
<i>Si?</i>

560
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,650
(knocking and grunting rhythmically)

561
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:06,318
Bang.

562
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:08,688
<i>ORAETTA: Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Cosmopolis.</i>

563
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,722
Oh...

564
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,360
Good morning.

565
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:19,611
It's Nurse Mayflower again.

566
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,379
How are we feeling this fine day?

567
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,698
- I...
- Hmm?

568
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:29,531
Oh. Well, a crisp fall Tuesday
is what it is.

569
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:30,609
Gobble, gobble.

570
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:33,237
(chuckles) Almost Thanksgiving.

571
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,281
Do Greek people celebrate that?
Turkey Day?

572
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,264
Hmm?

573
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,855
Oh, you poor soul.

574
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:51,193
You, your body is just working so hard
to pump that blood around.

575
00:36:51,195 --> 00:36:53,370
Your old daft heart.
It's not doing its job, is it?

576
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:55,548
- It's a bad heart, bad, bad, bad.
- (slap)

577
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,902
Yeah. And here the doctors say...

578
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,276
there's just not much
they can do. (sighs)

579
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:13,413
Mean old doctors.

580
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:15,413
(blows raspberry)

581
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:17,506
But Oraetta's here, and she can help.

582
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:19,507
You want Oraetta's help, right?

583
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,282
- Take the pain away?
- Yeah.

584
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:22,841
Yeah, yeah.

585
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,452
Of course you do.

586
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:27,771
Life's hard enough
without a lamb shank for a heart.

587
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,783
Don't you worry.

588
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:35,074
Your angel of mercy has arrived.

589
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:50,053
<i>SNEET: It's, well...</i>

590
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,967
<i>I have to say, Nurse Mayflower,</i>

591
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:55,155
<i>highly irregular.</i>

592
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,347
<i>Highly...</i>

593
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:00,562
not good is, well, what it is.

594
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:03,042
Such a high dosage of...

595
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:05,780
not even the proper medication.

596
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,938
Resulting in...

597
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,927
certain death, which...

598
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:12,580
We can't have that.

599
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,502
Patients come to us for care.

600
00:38:14,504 --> 00:38:18,307
Top quality care.
Not to be... mismanaged.

601
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,951
Mr. Sneet, believe me,
no one's more embarrassed

602
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,336
than little Ole me.

603
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:26,462
But at the same time,
have you seen their handwriting?

604
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:27,934
The doctors? Hmm.

605
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:29,981
Like a cave painting with a stick.

606
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,272
- N-N-Not, not that I-I...
- This isn't, I hate to say,

607
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:37,895
the first time we've had concerns
about your care.

608
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,495
The level of care.

609
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:46,119
Patients passing untimely
or rushed to the ICU

610
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:48,548
without biological provocation.

611
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,789
Not to mention the pharmacist
has noticed some discrepancies

612
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,195
in medicines requested
and medicines removed

613
00:38:57,197 --> 00:38:58,649
over the last few...

614
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,386
Requests made by you.

615
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:05,423
In summation,

616
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:09,192
after the latest unpleasantness,

617
00:39:09,194 --> 00:39:12,517
I don't see how
we can keep you on staff.

618
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,326
I'm saying you're fired.

619
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,390
I see how it is.

620
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,444
Yes. So, if you could

621
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:30,110
- clear out your locker...
- A cover-up.

622
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:32,672
Uh...

623
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:36,462
An incompetence of doctors. (scoffs)

624
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,851
A few lost souls,
and someone's got to pay the piper,

625
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:40,240
so old Oraetta's made the goat.

626
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,137
Well, I am no goat, Mr. Sneet.

627
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,531
- Oraetta Mayflower, she is no goat.
- Now, Nurse...

628
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,373
Call the police,
you're so concerned about malfeasance.

629
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,810
About medicines removed
without dotted I's.

630
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:52,924
Heck, pick up the phone,
tell them to send the paddy wagon.

631
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:55,209
Take this woman away
in silver bracelets.

632
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:57,041
Or what about call the news boys?

633
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,460
- Now, hold on, there's no need...
- This is America, sir,

634
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:02,404
last time I checked, not Soviet Russia,

635
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:04,153
where a man gets rationed
a quarter potato

636
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,823
and has no rights under the law.

637
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,925
And here's you,
sitting like judge and executioner,

638
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:12,131
tossing old Oraetta
on the bone pile, and for what?

639
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:13,770
The inability to read the handwriting

640
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:16,095
of what appears to be an epileptic?

641
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:22,136
Miss Mayflower...

642
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:25,152
Nurse Mayflower...

643
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,491
I'd be happy to...

644
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,017
How does a month's severance sound?

645
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,268
Three months.

646
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:35,792
I'll...

647
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:42,185
I can offer two, and of course
a glowing recommendation

648
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:44,404
- to your next potential employer.
- In writing.

649
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,159
I have to say, Mr. Sneet,
I'm disappointed

650
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,021
in this institution.

651
00:40:57,568 --> 00:40:58,798
In <i>you.</i>

652
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,922
When our days are at an end,
and we stand

653
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:03,218
before the Lord, he will weigh the color

654
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,780
of our immortal souls
and judge us lacking,

655
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:08,099
have we not shown
an unflagging commitment

656
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,422
to excellence in his name.

657
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:13,466
And if we have failed
in our devotion to him,

658
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:16,905
then you and I are going straight
to the hot place.

659
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:19,449
And Oraetta Mayflower

660
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,453
has no intention
of sweating out eternity

661
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:23,521
at the end of the devil's pitchfork.

662
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,676
Good day, sir.

663
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:29,793
(muttering)

664
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:48,234
- Who's that?
- Nurse, lives across the street.

665
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:51,789
<i>Bonjour.</i>

666
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:54,312
Get out of sight.

667
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:57,057
_

668
00:41:57,634 --> 00:41:58,985
_

669
00:41:59,638 --> 00:42:00,889
_

670
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:04,379
_

671
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:05,695
_

672
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:07,823
_

673
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:10,131
It's just amazing.

674
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:12,388
Who would've thought
they're teaching French

675
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,464
down at the Negro school. (sniffs)

676
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:17,243
They don't. I'm learning on my own.

677
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,374
Mm, you got pluck.

678
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,721
And I know,

679
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,047
'cause everyone always says
I've got it, too.

680
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:26,375
Sagittarius.

681
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:28,804
What's that?

682
00:42:28,806 --> 00:42:32,113
Sun sign. Astrology.

683
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:37,775
See, scientifically, our birthdates
correspond with celestial events.

684
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:39,601
Happenstance that shape our destiny.

685
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:41,066
What's the date of your birth?

686
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,558
- December the first.
- Mm.

687
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,377
Like I said...

688
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:48,174
Sagittarius.

689
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:51,156
Huh. Yeah.

690
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:54,126
I guess that makes us sisters of a sort.

691
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,427
Well... I got to get to my chores.

692
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:00,842
Oh. Yeah.

693
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,130
I-I was wondering if you might
be looking for some after-school work.

694
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:08,899
A little housecleaning,
put 50 cents or a dollar in your pocket.

695
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:14,171
That's all we are to you... the help?

696
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:19,144
There are long-playing records upstairs.

697
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,201
French songs, stories.

698
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:26,316
Postcards from gay Paree.
You can clean and listen.

699
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:30,987
I decided to make you
one of my special projects.

700
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:36,287
What does that mean?

701
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,060
You like pie?

702
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:40,723
Yeah, you do.

703
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:42,571
Everybody likes pie.

704
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:46,325
Stay-stay tuned. I-I-I will be back.

705
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:47,429
Oh.

706
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:54,759
That's one weird white lady.

707
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,469
(sniffles)

708
00:43:58,155 --> 00:44:00,156
(train whistling in distance)

709
00:44:00,158 --> 00:44:02,158
♪ ♪

710
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:20,875
Sir, I just want you to know I'm ready.

711
00:44:20,877 --> 00:44:22,106
Good.

712
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,967
Not just for muscle work.

713
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:30,237
Got math through high school.
Read a lot of history.

714
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:32,166
Strategy is what I'm about.

715
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:33,471
Yeah, well...

716
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:36,562
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

717
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:39,514
a stately pleasure-dome decree.

718
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:42,304
- Come again?
- (chuckles)

719
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,665
- What's your name?
- Leon.

720
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,253
