- I worked it out...

359
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:36,849
How to get the house back.

360
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:39,104
- Please.
- ORAETTA: Hi there.

361
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,198
Hi.

362
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,885
Don't let her get me.

363
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:45,963
What?

364
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,353
Hi. Aw.

365
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,938
Well, now, will you look at you,
the happy couple.

366
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,686
Yeah, you caught us.

367
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,455
Lemuel Cannon. And you are?

368
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,033
Hon, I wondered if I might bother you

369
00:18:58,058 --> 00:18:59,650
to come up to my apartment.

370
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,025
I've got nothing to say to you.

371
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,213
Now, hon, let's not do this
in front of your boyfriend.

372
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:08,072
- He is not my boyfriend.
- More of a suitor.

373
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,791
Fine, you want to do this here?

374
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,963
You give me back my ring!

375
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:17,033
That's right. I know
you stole it from me.

376
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:19,120
And I have half a mind
to go to the police.

377
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,361
No police.

378
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,775
Great. Call them.

379
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,351
I can tell them what
else I saw up there.

380
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:28,689
All your tokens, letters from the grave,

381
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:32,299
bottles of death, evidence.

382
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,127
Plus, how you like
to poison people's pies.

383
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,385
And who's gonna believe you?

384
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,409
- LEMUEL: I believe her.
- Who that counts?

385
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,235
Excuse me?

386
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,533
The Devil's got a special place in hell

387
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:52,826
for small minds who betray
their better's trust.

388
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:56,724
Who take advantage
of their charitable acts.

389
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:58,713
You need to leave now.

390
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,253
Is that place above or below

391
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:03,877
the place you're going?

392
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,158
- There's a word for people like you.
- No.

393
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:08,322
That's your word.

394
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:10,643
You invented it to make
yourself feel bigger.

395
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,908
But that's not what I am.

396
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:15,067
Walk away.

397
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:16,886
(WHISPERING): What does it feel like

398
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,444
to be so sure you're right
and know that nobody cares?

399
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:22,205
Hmm?

400
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,790
I'll see you in your dreams.

401
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,587
Thanks for making the time for me
on such short notice.

402
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:40,771
Uh, one question before we get started.

403
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,501
Who am I talking to here... Him or you?

404
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,008
HAPPY: You're talking to Leon.

405
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:47,734
He'll run things in the city.

406
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:50,276
We're just here for support.

407
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:52,792
Great. Isn't that great?

408
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:54,190
EBAL: Tremendous.

409
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:56,982
Of course,
if you want to take over from Loy,

410
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:59,159
you know how that works.

411
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,690
Just sad I can't kill him twice.

412
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:04,282
Yeah, I heard about
that tune-up he gave you.

413
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:07,276
Some people got no
respect for a promise.

414
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,687
We don't make promises.

415
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:12,182
- We make deals.
- HAPPY: Then let's make a deal.

416
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:15,284
Leon's gonna take over
all of Loy's territory,

417
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,845
including the slaughterhouses
on the East Side. And...

418
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,134
you gonna give him a piece of trucking.

419
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:24,290
Jesus.

420
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,657
I ain't been fucked
this rough since prison.

421
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:28,596
- GUARD: Hey, hang on...
- MILVIN: Absolutely not.

422
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,040
I am a city alderman, and I'm coming in.

423
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:36,384
What's this?

424
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:39,091
A top-secret meeting of the Hi Ho club?

425
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:41,384
- Who the fuck is this?
- My father-in-law.

426
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,221
Kind of amazing to see
him walking and talking,

427
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,376
don't you think?

428
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:46,439
Considering he's made
entirely out of Play-Doh.

429
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:48,181
Ha fuckin' ha.

430
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,206
Can I talk to you outside?

431
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:00,776
<i>JOSTO: Do you just
know when I'm having</i>

432
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,782
a bad day or are you watching
me from the bushes?

433
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,773
Laugh it up, greaseball.

Okay. Make it fast, Pops.

437
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:10,939
- I got a war to win.
- Fine.

438
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:13,634
I'll use small words
'cause I know you're low IQ.

439
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:14,860
The wedding's off.

440
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:17,650
You and your greasy wops
are public enemy number one.

441
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,892
So I'm breaking this retard union

442

like glass in an emergency. You hear me?

443
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,838
Don't call. Don't write.

445
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,009
- Means he's an idiot.
- (CHUCKLES): Oh,

446
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,525
- I'm an idiot?
- Yeah.

447
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,603
'Cause now's not the time
you call off a wedding.

448
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,635
Now's the time to renegotiate
the terms of our deal,

449
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,759
'cause you got me over a
barrel and I'm spread thin

450
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:36,295
and I'll spend anything
to keep from having

451
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,110
one more goddamn problem.

452
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,032
But clearly,
you're not smart enough to do that.

453
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,134
Listen to me, eggplant Einstein.

454
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,859
You and your kind

455
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,884
are getting run out of town on a rail.

456
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,712
It doesn't take a wizard to see that.

457
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:49,737
So, I'm doing us both a favor,

458
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:52,275
and I'm running away from you
like a fart in an elevator,

- Yeah.

That's his car, though.

541
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:20,876
Got picked up by
a squad car this morning.

I came to tell you they earned it.

695
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:40,312
The original loan was $3,500.

696
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,343
Interest starting at ten percent,

697
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,367
spread over six months.

698
00:45:44,392 --> 00:45:46,664
That's $6,200.

699
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:48,593

700
00:45:48,618 --> 00:45:50,531
With all monies returned.

701
00:45:50,556 --> 00:45:53,323
And seeing as how you
chose <i>not</i> to kill them,

702
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:58,146
I'm assuming you felt their
punishment should be monetary.

703
00:45:58,171 --> 00:45:59,343
A fine.

704
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:00,789

00:46:00,814 --> 00:46:02,437

706
00:46:02,462 --> 00:46:04,362

00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,547

We don't do that here.

715
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:32,125
You're in a war and you've lost 27 men.

716
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:33,632
Something like that.

717
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,856
No. Exactly that.

718
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:39,731
27 men... Shot, stabbed, strangled.

719
00:46:40,154 --> 00:46:44,226
27 men requiring the services
of a licensed mortician.

720
00:46:45,757 --> 00:46:48,211
I've got the invoice here.

721
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:52,281
The total cost comes out to $8,700.

722
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:55,382
That's not how it works.

723
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:58,576
8,700 in agreed-upon services.

724
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:03,160
Plus this.

725
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:11,808
Gold ring.

726
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,968
Pawn shop'd give you four, five hundred.

727
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,640
Which would leave you at...

728
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,486
who the hell cares?

729
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:23,547
I already told you...
That's not how it works.

730
00:47:23,572 --> 00:47:27,274
No. You haven't seen the part
that makes it priceless yet.

731
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:30,167
The part that's gonna make
you give me what I want.

732
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:35,231
There's a nurse who lives
across the street from me.

733
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,092
She had the ring.

734
00:47:37,117 --> 00:47:39,422
So now you're selling me a stolen ring.

735
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:43,895
She had a lot of other things,
this nurse.

736
00:47:44,116 --> 00:47:46,068
Took them from her patients.

737
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:48,961
Kept them in a closet
next to their obituaries,

738
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:52,625
and medicine she gave
them to help them pass on.

739
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,914
This nurse?

740
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,312
Cops arrested her last night.

741
00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:01,064
She poisons people, see?

742
00:48:01,354 --> 00:48:03,187
And takes their things.

743
00:48:03,212 --> 00:48:06,070
A keepsake, like this ring.

744
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:08,640
And I started thinking.

745
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:11,523
Whose ring is it?

746
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:15,147
So, I went to the library

747
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:16,861
<i>and looked through the obits.</i>

748
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,492
_

749
00:48:32,425 --> 00:48:34,625
I want you to give my
folks their house back.

750
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:36,140
And their business.

751
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:38,195
All debts forgave.

752
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,932
And just what the hell
do you think you've got

753
00:48:39,956 --> 00:48:42,390
that's gonna make me do that?

754
00:48:42,985 --> 00:48:45,519
I'm gonna help you win your war.

755
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:51,716
You do that,
you can have anything you want.

756
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,570
Swear it.

757
00:48:56,856 --> 00:48:58,375
Swear.

758
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,143
Good.

759
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,492
♪ <i>Yeah, she did</i> ♪
