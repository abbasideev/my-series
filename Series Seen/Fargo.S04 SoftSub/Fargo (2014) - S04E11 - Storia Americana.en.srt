<i>(MEN STOMPING RHYTHMICALLY)</i>

368
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,799
<i>We are Black and white,</i>

369
00:33:37,026 --> 00:33:39,893
<i>rich and poor,</i>

370
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:43,437
<i>foreign-born and domestic.</i>

371
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:47,792
<i>And yet, if our pasts are separate,</i>

372
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,348
<i>then aren't our histories separate, too?</i>

373
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,346
<i>Segregated?</i>

374
00:33:54,922 --> 00:33:56,554
<i>Ask yourself:</i>

375
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:58,855
<i>who writes the books?</i>

376
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,749
<i>Who chooses what we remember
and what gets forgotten?</i>

377
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:07,886
My name is Ethelrida Pearl Smutny.

378
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:11,045
This is my history report.
