(SWANEE RETCHES)

913
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:04,248
(COUGHS)

914
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:07,095
Hey.

915
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:19,863
(GASPS)

916
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:23,176
Please...

917
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,447
- (FLATULENCE)
- (GROANS)

918
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,182
(COUGHING)

919
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:45,845
Did they get you?

920
00:55:45,948 --> 00:55:48,762
No. They shot up the car,
but we slipped through.

921
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,657
Boss, they lit us up here, too.

922
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,748
Not now.

923
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,115
Did you see the hitters?

924
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,351
The skeleton was driving... Calamita...

925
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,986
And Rabbi rode bitch.

926
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,189
He pulled the shots.

927
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,484
They charged in my blind spot,
but I handled it.

928
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,299
Now do you get it?

929
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:06,102
The cost. What it means
to be in this family.

930
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:08,171
- Do you feel it?
- They weren't shooting at me.

931
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:10,073
Boy, you clinically stupid?

932
00:56:10,175 --> 00:56:11,274
They were shooting at you.

933
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:12,561
I was a proxy.

934
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:14,229
What?

935
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,331
A proxy, a stand-in.

936
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,265
I know what a proxy is.
What's your name?

937
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:21,334
- Your name.
- Lemuel.

938
00:56:21,436 --> 00:56:23,870
No, your family name.

939
00:56:23,972 --> 00:56:25,404
Cannon.

940
00:56:26,858 --> 00:56:28,825
You see these boys?

941
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,039
They got their own name.

942
00:56:32,613 --> 00:56:35,314
That would make them proxies.

943
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,127
But you?

944
00:56:38,286 --> 00:56:41,048
Your brother, your sisters, your mama?

945
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,509
You're me.

946
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:46,592
Like it or don't like it. Don't matter.

947
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,162
It ain't my business. I'm a music man.

948
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,731
Now you're choosing to be ignorant.

949
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:54,500
No. You're making the choosing.

950
00:56:54,602 --> 00:56:56,502
But you can't have both more.

951
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:59,138
More power, more safe...
You can't have both.

952
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,008
It's less power, more safe, or this.

953
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:06,111
What I choose don't matter.

954
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:12,584
20 Gs.

955
00:57:12,686 --> 00:57:15,053
It's what they shotgunned out of here.

956
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,392
Three dead.

957
00:57:19,492 --> 00:57:20,963
The Italians?

958
00:57:21,328 --> 00:57:22,627
OMIE: Two broads.

959
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,025
One of 'em threw up everywhere.

960
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:30,013
DOCTOR SENATOR:
You got to see the whole picture.

961
00:57:30,637 --> 00:57:32,303
That's the point.

962
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,341
I'm saying a coordinated action

963
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:39,911
implies planning. Hmm?

964
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,780
Maybe this is the Night
of the Long Knives, huh?

965
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:48,485
Lock it down.

966
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:51,952
Everything.

967
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,558
I want six guys in front of the house.

968
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,260
Already done.

969
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:00,419
You sure it was Rabbi?

970
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:02,379
Yeah.

971
00:58:03,102 --> 00:58:04,735
What does it mean?

972
00:58:06,925 --> 00:58:08,325
Should I wake up the white boy

973
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:09,993
and bloody his fucking face?

974
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:12,463
Turn up the flames, you're saying?

975
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:14,164
Hmm, bring this thing to a boil?

976
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:17,477
They're holding my son.

977
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,440
He could be swinging from a
tree right now, for all we know.

978
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,903
What I want to know is...

979
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,156
who gave the order?

980
00:58:29,581 --> 00:58:33,282
Was it the boss or was it the brother?

981
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,996
Could be they're
fighting with each other.

982
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:37,497
Hmm?

983
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:40,225
Yeah.

984
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,794
Tail wagging the dog.

985
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,565
So?

986
00:58:47,165 --> 00:58:49,134
Well, I'm saying,

987
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,721
once we start shooting back,

988
00:58:54,204 --> 00:58:55,682
it's to the death.

989
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,517
So...

990
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,168
we better be sure.
