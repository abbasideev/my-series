here's me, still...

414
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,870
bamboozled at every turn.

415
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:22,783
I told those ladies no
harm would come to them.

416
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,657
That makes me accountable.

417
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:31,064
Should I tell you what I've learned

418
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,181
about the criminal mindset?

419
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:37,119
By definition,
the criminal rejects accountability,

420
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:40,980
as their identity is based
on getting away with things.

421
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:43,216
Similarly, the criminal...

422
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:45,596
You...

423
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:48,788
Rejects morality and ethics,
for if there is a larger right,

424
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:51,174
then the criminal
himself is always wrong.

425
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,955
And you don't strike
me as the type of man

426
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,612
thinks himself wrong.

427
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:58,721
Rarely.

428
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,611
So there goes morality out the window.

429
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:03,744
But into that vacuum,

430
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,903
what should rush but a code.

431
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,919
A system of rules,

432
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:13,146
mostly having to do with loyalty.

433
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:15,486
And this way,
the criminal detaches himself

434
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,791
from the civilian world.

435
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,719
And yet, here I am.

436
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,072
Family man. Community leader.

00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,580
Deacon in the church.

438
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,946
(LAUGHS): Oh,
the criminal is capable of being

439
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:33,383
all of those things.

440
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,977
But it's a ruse.

441
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:39,156
For though you claim to
share the values of your...

442
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,581
wife or preacher,

443
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,500
the Lord knows it's a disguise.

444
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,076
Ask me how I know for certain.

445
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:49,477
How do you know for certain?

446
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,727
Would a family man trade his
youngest son to his enemy

447
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:54,253
in exchange for power and monetary gain?

448
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,836
You need to leave.

449
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:08,219
And so we circle back, inevitably,

450
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:09,642
to your original statement...

451
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,805
To wit, I'm accountable
for those ladies,

452
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,875
murderers both, thieves and cheats.

453
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,625
But now, since we both know

454
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,451
the criminal is capable
of love and loyalty

455
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:21,735
only when it suits
his own self-interest,

456
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,930

457
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:26,795
It don't.

like Isaac in the Holy Book,

462
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:43,009
well, then giving up two strangers

463
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:46,102
to keep the might of the federal
government off your back...

464
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,914

as facile as breathing.

This is... this isn't a choice.

523
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,291

When I was a kid,

525
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,691

I-I worried too much, which...

much when you're at war?

better when I'm in charge,

when I got the power.

00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:42,144
That's why I joined the force.

534
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,088
You know, because cops have power.

535
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,841
So, now I'm on the street. I'm the boss.

536
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:49,051
Except, turns out,
being a cop's real risky.

537
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,976
Risky makes me nervous.

538
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:54,254
So I m... I make a deal with the street.

I take a few bucks,
I-I look the other way.
