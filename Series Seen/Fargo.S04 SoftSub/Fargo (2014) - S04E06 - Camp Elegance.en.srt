Monte Cassino.

554
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:17,706
They send me here, to Kansas.

555
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,777
Did you know they
bring war prisoners here?

556
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:26,816
I think I was dead.

557
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:29,652
A corpse, they shipped.

558
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:32,254
A skeleton.

559
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:35,724
It was the food, the smell,

560
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:37,192
that bring me back.

561
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:39,194
Fields of corn.

562

00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,201
That's in the Constitution.

565

Every day the sun come out.

566
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:55,977
That big yellow American sun.

567
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,947
It make me grow again,

568
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:01,248
like a winter weed.

569
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,917
And then,

570
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:05,487
I am alive again.

571
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,655
I took the blood oath,

572
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:10,492
carve my name on the stone there.

573
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:15,129
"Antoon Dumini,

574

575
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:21,202
This I would become.

576
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:25,272

No.

I-Is he dead?

585
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,274
Yes. Don't look away.

586
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:39,111
This is what men do. Snap out of it.

587
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,113
We have to go.

588
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,882
It's war now, for real.

589
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,318
You're not safe here.

590
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,320
Home?

591
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:51,323
You're not safe there, either.

592
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,198
You trust me?

593
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,539
I never got to choose.

what they made me.

595

But that's not gonna happen to you.

Understand?

597
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:16,547
I think so.

598
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:18,983
So we're gonna find someplace quiet,

599
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:20,418
wait till the dust settles.

600
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,420
And then, if you want to go home...

601

If that's your choice...

602
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:27,125
I'll take you home.

00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,495
I'm scared.
