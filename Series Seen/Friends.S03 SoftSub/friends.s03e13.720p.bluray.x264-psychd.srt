the most amazing week.

339
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,566
Would it be so terrible?

340
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,488
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

341
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:47,161
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

342
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,748
...and vowed to be friends forever.

343
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,378
Wow.

344
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,507
You know, we're back where we were.

345
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:06,305
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

346
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,226
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

[CHUCKLES]

348
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,730
Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.

349
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,859
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

350
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,612
You know what?

351
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,865
I gotta walk out of here right now.

352
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,204
Because getting over you is
the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

353
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,041
Um, I don't think I could do it again.

354
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,003
I know I couldn't.

355
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,047
Yeah.

356
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,051
So...

[RICHARD CHUCKLES]

358
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,354
How about one last game of racquetball?
Hmm?

[MONICA CHUCKLES]

360
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,404
- Watch the thorns.
- Ow.

361
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,871
What?

362
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,249
Beth is really, really sick.

363
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,751
Oh.

364
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,800
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

365
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,680
- Joey?
- Yeah?

366
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,350
You wanna put the book in the freezer?

367
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,353
BOTH:
Okay.
