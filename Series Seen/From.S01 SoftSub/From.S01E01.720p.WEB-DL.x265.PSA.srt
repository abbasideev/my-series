- Well, that's good news, then.
- Why?

184
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:36,696
Because there's no such
thing as monsters, honey,

and if there's no such
thing as monsters,

00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:42,571
then that means that Norman's
still alive, doesn't it?

No, but they're...
they're still there. Go...

706
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,928
- It's okay.
- [Ellis] It's okay. It's okay.

707
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:37,712
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yes, I'm okay, Mom.

708
00:41:37,843 --> 00:41:38,887
- You're okay.
- It's okay, Mom.

709
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,889
Okay. Well, good news is
that he's stable.

710
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,412
- Yeah.
- His airway's clear, his pulses

711
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,937
are strong, and there's no
obvious damage to the artery.

712
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,373
- Bad news?
- I mean, there's a table leg

713
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,941
through his thigh. We can't
exactly just yank him...

714
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,204
How much time you
need to do it right?

715
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:55,425
- I don't know. At least an hour.
- The mom's awake.

716
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:58,777
And we got, like, 40 minutes
of daylight left, so...

717
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:01,344
- Can you fix him in the RV?
- What?

718
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:03,216
Can you stitch the
kid up inside the RV?

719
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:04,783
Well, I don't know...

720
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:09,831
Will that even work?

721
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:12,791
I don't know.

722
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:16,664
It'll work.

723
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:20,842
- Kristi.
- It'll work.

724
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,105
[Jim] It's alright, boy.

725
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,150
That's alright.

726
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,674
[Creaking, rustling]

727
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:36,249
Hey. It's Jim, right?

728
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,207
- Yeah.
- Hey. Okay.

729
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,035
Very important to
keep him flat, okay?

730
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:45,432
We can't rule out a
spinal or a neck injury.

731
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,303
- [Jim groaning]
- [Kristi] Okay? Good. Yeah.

732
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,478
- Support him.
- [Jim] That?

733
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,350
Yep. Support
his neck like that. Good.

734
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,049
Gentle. Good.
Nice and soft. Good.

735
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,485
Okay. Perfect.

736
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,139
Okay.
Your wife's awake.

737
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:00,229
You should
go talk to her.

738
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,230
Alright.

739
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:04,233
I can take it from here.

740
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,757
You sure?

741
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:06,801
Yeah.

742
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:17,986
- Be careful.
- [Jim grunting] Thanks.

743
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:19,988
Okay.

744

[Grunting]

745
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:38,180
I just want
to see my kid.

746
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:39,268
- I understand.
- [Jim] Tabby.

747
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:40,487
- [Boyd] I...
- [Tabitha] Yeah. Hi.

748
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,315
Hey, Jim.

749
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:46,362
Hi. Jim, where... where...
where... where is he?

750
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:50,149
He's okay, uh, but
he's, uh... stuck.

751
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,064
But there's a doctor here
that's gonna help him get out.

752
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:53,239
[Boyd] Yeah.

753
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,240
There's...

754
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:57,460
He says we
have to leave.

755
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:58,810
- [Jim] What?
- [Boyd] Look.

756
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,377
We don't have a lot of
time to talk about this.

757
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:03,249
We're not
leaving anywhere.

758
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,120
Please listen to me.

759
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:07,209
These woods are not
safe after dark.

760
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,603
Hey, if you wanna stay,
that's fine,

761
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,953
but you, you can barely
stand, and your daughter

762
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,912
- needs to get back to town.
- [Jim] It's okay.

763
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:15,827
- It's alright.
- [Boyd] Hey. Hey.

764
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,437
Yeah.

765
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,308
I don't want to
bury any more kids.

766
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,310
Alright? Come on.

Is everyone okay?

770
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:47,989
I don't think so.

771
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:54,909
Oh, God.

772
00:44:57,129 --> 00:45:00,567
I... I... I shouldn't
have been... [Sobbing]

773
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,916
Shh.

774
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:04,571
Fuck. Why did I...

775
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,703
Shh.

776
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:27,028
This isn't your fault.

777
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,378

the car gives you any trouble,

781
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:45,960
you cut him loose.
You hear me?

782
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:47,309
Thank you for coming.

783
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:53,098
Look. You know
this is suicide.

784
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,016
Just take care of
the family.

785
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,376
[Tabitha]
Look. I'm staying.

786
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:12,770
My baby's in there.

How am I
supposed to just...

788
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,427
Jim, let's just...
Let's just walk over.

789
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:20,342
We'll get Thomas, and we'll
just get out of here.

790
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:21,169
- Jim, please.
- Tabby.

791
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:24,085
It's Ethan.

792
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:27,828
Ethan's the one stuck in the RV.

793
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,355
It's okay. It's okay.

794
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,401
It's okay.

795
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:39,622
I know. I'm sorry.

796
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:41,624
It's just my head.
[Sobbing]

797
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:45,063
It just hurts.

798
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:47,369
The doctor needs
to focus on Ethan.

799
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,241
- If she's worried about you...
- Yeah.

800
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,590
...she can't do
what she has to do.

801
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,158
No, no, no, no.
She... she has to stay... Yeah.

802
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:58,772
Jim, I don't... I don't
trust these people.

803
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,644
There's something
really weird. I don't...

804
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,646
What does it mean,
"The woods aren't safe"?

805
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:05,823
What is that? What?
The woods aren't safe?

806
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:08,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know this is, uh...

807
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:09,652
But we gotta go.

- [Grunting]
- Okay.

812
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:25,494
So, we have to separate
the table leg from the table,

813
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,583
and it's gonna be dark out, so
do you have any lanterns

814
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,063
or lights or anything like that?

815
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:30,412
[Jim] Yeah. Uh, got, uh...

816
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,588
- I got lamps.
- [Kristi] Great.

817
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,201
Uh, got lanterns.

818
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:42,511

- Uh, good.

Uh, we're almost
ready to go.

- [Boyd] Yeah.
- [Kristi] Okay, Jim.

823
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,679
I'm gonna need you around
here, just to support

824

- the head and neck, okay?
- Okay.

825
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,860
[Boyd] Hey, Jim? Would you grab
me that blanket right there?

826
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:28,601
Right by your... by your left
foot. Right there.

It's okay. It's okay.
We can make it to Colony House.

835
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,919
That's if they open the door
for us.

836
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,703
They'll open the door!
Alright? Come on.

- [Father] Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:31,925
It's very important that we get
inside as soon as possible,

that you run as fast as you can.

need to understand

happens next.

be just fine.
