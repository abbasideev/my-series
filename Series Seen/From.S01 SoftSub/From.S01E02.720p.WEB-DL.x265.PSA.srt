<i>Previously on From...</i>

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,230
Meagan, what are you doing?

3
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,145
Maybe I can come in.

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:16,190
Meagan, no!

5
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,846
A man protects
his family, Frank!

6
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,761
Open your eyes and look!

7
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,154
No!

8
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,548
"Norman, you're gonna be okay."

9
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:28,289
"Tell my parents
I said... goodbye.

10
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:29,768
"Ah!"

11
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,249
Sorry, buddy, Norman's dead.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,686
Mom!
Julie killed Norman.

13
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:35,731
What happened to Norman?

14
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,515
The monsters killed them.

15
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,517
There's no such thing
as monsters, honey.

16
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,389
Why is there a tree in
the middle of the road?

17
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,305
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,178
Sorry to interrupt your service.
I was wondering

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,572
if you could point me in
the direction of the highway.

20
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:53,357
Yeah, you just keep on following
the road right up that hill,

21
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:54,837
right where you were going
and you'll see.

22
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:58,406
How is this possible?
We're on the same fucking road!

23
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:03,933
Tabby?

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,500
Dad, I think he's bleeding!

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,718
There's something in his leg!

26
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:17,990
Hey! We need help!

27
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,515
You just rest.
I'll be back soon.

28
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,866
Look at
the mess he made.

29
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,737
Well, that's not
exactly his fault.

30
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:27,609
I don't like.

31
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,133
Let's get you downstairs.

32
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,700
Can you stitch
the kid up inside the RV?

33
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,876
Well, I don't
know wha...

34
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,270
It'll work.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,750
- You know this is suicide.
- Just take care of the family.

36
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,491
Run as fast as you can!
No matter what you see,

37
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,753
no matter what you hear,

38
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,451
- you do not stop!
- This isn't your fault.

39
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,756
What do you mean?

40
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,238
Hold his neck!

41
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,110
- Yeah, you're doing great.
- Ethan, Ethan...

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,633
Good, good, good, good.

43
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:52,590
Shit.

44
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,811
Kristi?

45
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,769
They're comin'.

46
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:37,929
♪

47
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,547
Hands under the neck!
Under the neck! Good.

48
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,070
- Why won't it stop?
- Kristi?

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,202
- We're good, we're good.
- Ethan, come on.

50
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,553
We're doing good.
Keep the airway open like that.

51
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay. Ethan?

52
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,475
Ethan?

53
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,085
Ethan?

54
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,307
He's breathing.
He's stable. Okay?

55
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,092
He has a pulse.
You're okay. You're okay.

56
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:17,926
Is everyone okay in there?

57
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,449
They're back.

58
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,277
No. Wait.

59
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,800
They came back for us.

60
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,977
Are you going to let 'em in?

61
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,849
No.

62
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,980
Why are we waiting?

63
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,982
I'm not letting 'em in!

64
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,595
I'm gonna help 'em in, then.

65
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:35,813
Jim, no!

66
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,772
Jim, look... stop!
Oh, hey! Jim, Jim!

67
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,426
Back off! I need you...
I need you to...

68
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,079
Take it... take it easy.
All right, buddy.

69
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,343
All right.
All right, buddy.

70
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,520
They are not people and they are
not here to help, Jim!

71
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,999
Let me go, man.

72
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,088
Okay. You good?

73
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,525
Let me go.

74
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,135
Fucking fuck!

75
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,179
All right.

76
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,189
Can you see it?
You see it?

77
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,974
It's right up there, come on.
We're good.

78
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:07,976
- Come on! Go, go!
- Come on. Let's go.

79
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,847
- Wait, where's my mom? Mom!
- Come on! Let's go.

80
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,327
We're almost there!
Keep moving!

81
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,198
- Come on!
- Don't stop! Go, go, go!

82
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,070
- Hey! Hey!
- Watch out!

83
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,115
Watch your step here!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

84
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,334
Fuck! Pick him up!

85
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,162
Are you okay?
Hey, I need help here!

86
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,946
- No, no!
- Should we go back?

87
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,948
Kenny, take them!
Kenny, You gotta take them!

88
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,386
Go, go, go!
Don't stop. Don't look!

89
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,431
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no!

90
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,694
You've gotta get up!
You've gotta get up!

91
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:31,608
You've gotta get up!

92
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,001
Come on!

93
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,437
Motherfucker, come on!

94
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,137
You can't stop.

95
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:51,802
Runners on the hill!
We got runners on the hill!

96
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:54,892
Runners on the hill!

97
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,550
- Go, go, go!
- Who's in there?

98
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,073
- Don't look back! Go!
- Why are we...

99
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,032
Come on! Go! Go!

100
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,212
What are you doing?!
Open the door!

101
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,605
Those aren't our people!

102
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,258
Ellis is out there!
What's wrong with you?!

103
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,261
I can't. No! I said no!

104
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:18,220
Straight to the door!
Come on!

105
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,830
- Open the door!
- Hello?!

106
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,179
- Hey! Open the door!
- We need help!

107
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,616
Hey! Hey!

108
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,748
What's going on?
Why won't they open the door?!

109
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,272
Donna!
Donna, let us in!

110
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:28,622
We have people out here!
Open the door!

111
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,928
- Donna, let us in!
- Do you hear that?

112
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:34,889
What are you doing?
Let us in!

113
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,325
Put the gun down
and open the door!

114
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,544
Donna!

115
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,023
You said not to
let anybody in here.

116
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,809
- Never open the door after dark.
- I know you're scared,

117
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,289
but are you really gonna
let those people die?

118
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,857
Donna, hey!
Open the fucking door!

119
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,337
Don't look at that!

120
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,730
No, no, no, no, no, no!

121
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,036
- Julie.
- Hey! What are you doing?!

122
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,603
Don't you recognize me?

123
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:58,782
Oh, my God!

124
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,871
- Go inside!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

125
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,875
You, on the floor.

126
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,486
What?

127
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,923
- On the floor now!
- No, no, no, no.

128
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,229
You don't have to get down! No!

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,318
You shut your mouth! I said,
get on the goddamn floor!

130
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,059
- Why?
- Just do what she says.

131
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,104
- Now!
- It's okay.

132
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,453
Tie them up.

133
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,846
Hey, Donna, come on.

134
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,500
We have a protocol.

135
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,635
Ellis, just come on.

136
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,290
Okay.

137
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,902
Why are you doing this?

138
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,643
We're not gonna
do anything!

139
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:34,992
Please?

140
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,341
Mom...

141
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,518
It's okay. It's okay.

142
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,171
I'm here, I'm here.
It's okay, baby.

143
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,873
Are they gone?

144
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,006
Hard to tell.

145
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:53,924
You okay? Hey, Jim?

146
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,186
Hey, you still with us?

147
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,667
Yeah.

148
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,669
You said...

149
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,368
You said they aren't people.

150
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,283
That's right.

151
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:08,722
Then what are they?

152
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:09,984
Well, we don't know.

153
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:13,596
Look,

154
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,557
these talismans, they're what
protect the houses in town.

155
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:21,909
I don't know why it works,
but you got one of those,

156
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,433
you keep the doors and windows
shut; they can't get in.

157
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,175
Never tried it on a vehicle.

158
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,350
This is impossible.

159
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,700
Yeah, it is.

160
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,226
Has he had seizures
like this before?

161
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,055
No, never.

162
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,972
What? What does that mean?

163
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:43,844
Nothing.
It doesn't mean anything yet.

164
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,019
It could mean
a number of things,

165
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,630
trauma from the accident,
but right now,

166
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,719
we need to focus on getting this
out of his leg so...

167
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,981
Dad?

168
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,417
Hey.

169
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,334
Ah, I know.

170
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:59,294
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Hey.

171
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,775
Okay, sweets, we're just gonna
give you a little poke, okay?

172
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,080
What is that?

173
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,995
It's a sedative,
just to help keep him calm.

174
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,257
Okay.

175
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,390
Okay. All right.
Hey, look at me.

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,131
Look at me.
No, you don't need to see that.

177
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,741
That's it.
Look at me, look at me.

178
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,134
Ow!

179
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,831
- That's it, that's it.
- All done!

180
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,441
There, look at you.
All done.

181
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,182
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

182
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,315
- Alright?
- Yeah. That's it. That's it.

183
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,976
Is he from the RV?

184
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,021
No.
He's from another car.

185
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,936
There was an accident
outside of town.

186
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,983
So, there were two cars?
Never seen that before.

187
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,725
Yeah. Neither have I.

188
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,948
That's a nice watch.

189
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,515
Hey. Just leave it alone.

190
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,997
Why? It's not like it's
gonna do him any good here.

191
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,129
Yeah. It's not gonna do
anything for you either.

192
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,305
But it's pretty.

193
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,481
So is he.

194
00:10:56,612 --> 00:11:00,442
I mean, even with
the blood and everything,

195
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,618
he's very handsome.

196
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,273
Don't touch anything, okay?

197
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,189
Fine.

198
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,321
I'm just gonna stay and look
at him for a little while.

199
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,069
Where's my daughter?

200
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,028
She's good. She's fine.

201
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,030
Listen, sorry about what
happened down there,

202
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,380
but it was necessary.
You'll understand that soon.

203
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,164
I need to see Julie!

204
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,339
She's good.
She's fine.

205
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,514
You need some water.

206
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,389
Here.

207
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,394
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa... stop!

208
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,352
- Julie!
- Hey! Hey!

209
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:42,527
- Julie!
- Stop!

210
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:43,964
- Sit!
- Ow!

211
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,095
Sit!

212
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,318
Watch her.

213
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,190
Okay.

214
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,367
Listen.

215
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,590
I know none of this
makes sense yet,

216
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,331
but these are
precautions we have to take.

217
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,985
We don't know you,

218
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,422
and everyone reacts differently
on their first night.

219
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:10,468
But I promise you, there is
not a single person here

220
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,688
who wants to hurt you
or your daughter.

221
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,299
Everyone in this house,

222
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,956
everyone in this town has been
exactly where you are right now.

223
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:23,046
I need to see my daughter!

224
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,614
And you will.

225
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,616
But first, we have to talk.

226
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,359
There are things you need to
know about where you are,

227
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:34,057
about the way things are now.

228
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,407
This, unfortunately,

229
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,409
is gonna be the worst
conversation of your life.

230
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,286
Do you believe in monsters?

231
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,383
Hello.

232
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,563
I'm gonna take some peaches.

233
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,086
You mind?

234
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:15,316
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to take these.

235
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,579
But-but Donna, she...

236
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,189
she looks
the other way sometimes,

237
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,628
and we all get a little wiggle
room on one or two things.

238
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,457
I was gonna
open them in my room,

239
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:29,373
but I'll open 'em here,
if you want some.

240
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,858
You're from one of
those two cars, huh?

241
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:39,993
That hasn't happened
in a long, long time.

242
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,473
It's special.

243
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,003
What do you think it means?

244
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:51,569
Please don't...

245
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,354
Victor!
What are you doing?

246
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,096
Leave that poor girl alone.

247
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,272
We were
having a conversation.

248
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,752
You're scaring her.
You know the rules.

249
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,145
Now, take your peaches
and shoo.

250
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,062
Hm.

251
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:10,110
Sorry about that.

252
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,328
He's creepy,
but he's harmless.

253
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,635
He's just been here
a really long time.

254
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,333
I'm Fatima.
I'm gonna be your proxy.

255
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:20,424
My what?

256
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,470
It's just a fancy way of saying
I'm here to keep you company.

257
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,344
Sorry about the...

258
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,130
Sometimes people freak out
a bit the first night.

259
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,522
It's scary, and it's weird,

260
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,655
and it's just sometimes
too much, you know?

261
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:35,657
We just don't want
anyone getting hurt.

262
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,746
Really?

263
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,791
Is that why those guys
pointed guns at us?

264
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,751
They shouldn't
have done that.

265
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,755
Look, everybody here is just
doing the best they can.

266
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,670
You really gotta focus
on the good things here.

267
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:04,207
If I untie you, do you promise
not to do anything crazy?

268
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,340
There's something I'd
really like to show you.

269
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:10,474
Okay.

270
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,562
Okay.

271
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,446
Who did all this?

272
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:29,798
Ellis.
He's really talented.

273
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,366
I bet he'd love
to draw you.

274
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,629
Why?

275
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,761
'Cause you're beautiful.

276
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:39,242
That's not funny.

277
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,070
I wasn't being funny.

278
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,945
Come on.

279
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,513
We have to keep all
the windows covered at night.

280
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,951
It's harder for them to trick
you if you can't see them.

281
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,648
Who?

282
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,346
Those things out there.

283
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,827
They whisper,
try to get in your head.

284
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,482
It said your name, right?

285
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:05,312
Sometimes they convince people
to let them in and...

286
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,575
Well...

287
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,533
Here. Come here.

288
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,579
Just don't...
don't look down.

289
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,581
Just look out.

290
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,420
Why did you bring me here?

291
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,424
'Cause I wanted
you to see...

292
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,643
that if you climb high enough,

293
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,994
even a nightmare
can look like a dream.

294
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,004
Okay, good.
Pulse is strong;

295
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,397
his breathing's really good.
I think we're good to go.

296
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:53,447
You really should've
let us help you.

297
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,630
What happens if they get in?

298
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,414
Jim...

299
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,548
What...
happens if they get in?

300
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:11,682
You have a gun.

301
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,380
Why don't you use it?

302
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,859
'Cause it won't do any good!

303
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,513
You... you just gotta trust me.

304
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,688
I don't know you.

305
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,352
Well, there has to be
something we can do.

306
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,441
Jim, Jim, Jim! Hey!
Jim! Jim, Jim, Jim!

307
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,921
Hey, we just have to
wait it out, okay?

308
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,923
With the talisman in the window,

309
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,230
the only way they can get in
here is if we let 'em in.

310
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,450
So, come on, just...

311
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,453
Come on.

312
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:48,980
Is that door secure?

313
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,678
It's not gonna open.
Just, just...

314
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,549
The talisman,
what if it... what if it...

315
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,898
- What if it falls?
- Kristi!

316
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,248
- What if it falls?
- Kristi! Hey! Hey, hey!

317
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:58,338
It's not gonna fall.
This is what they do, right?

318
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,426
-Try to rattle you.

319
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,515
Get in your head.

320
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:04,561
Make you do something stupid.
You know that, right?

321
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:14,963
They're on the roof.

322
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,881
Okay, listen
to me, kiddo.

323
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,753
Listen, hey, breathe with me.
Breathe.

324
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:26,148
Okay. Let's forget
about what's outside.

325
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,498
Let's just think
about what's in here.

326
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,372
Focus on him.

327
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,025
Okay?

328
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,593
You got this, kiddo.
You got it.

329
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,682
You got this, right?

330
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:42,164
We focus on Ethan.

331
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:46,299
We all stay calm.
You tell us what we need to do.

332
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:47,822
Kenny!

333
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:50,868
It's not right, tying 'em up
like fuckin' animals.

334
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,914
They must be scared
out of their minds!

335
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,872
They have their own way
of doing things here.

336
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:56,439
Yeah.
It's a fucked-up way.

337
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,485
Isn't it?

338
00:18:58,615 --> 00:18:59,877
Hey.

339
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,143
There's a room made up
for you on the third floor.

340
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:06,797
Just let the guys know when
you're ready to call it a night.

341
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,364
What? You're not
gonna tie us up first?

342
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,628
Thank you, Ellis.

343
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,675
Uh, the man we helped
carry in, is he...

344
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:17,068
Ah, yeah, no, that guy, uh,
yeah, he's still out.

345
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,723
I mean, I don't know what kind
of drugs that guy was on,

346
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:23,336
but he's gonna have a hell
of a time when he wakes up.

347
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:27,078
Look, man, I know, uh...

348
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,778
I know Donna can be
a little, you know...

349
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,693
but they opened
the door, though, right?

350
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:36,523
Eventually.

351
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:37,785
Yeah, well, all I'm saying is

352
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,395
tonight could've been
a whole lot worse.

353
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:42,093
I mean, if you didn't leave
the fuckin' spike strip down...

354
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,095
Hey, hey, come on!

355
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,793
Are you fucking
kidding right now?

356
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,795
Enough.

357
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,062
Look, it's been
a long night, okay?

358
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,324
Yeah.

359
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,325
Come on.

360
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,240
Yeah. Yeah.

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
Just in case

362
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,726
you could use a little
something to take the edge off.

363
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,206
It's a kind gesture.

364
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:11,166
Yeah, whatever.

365
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,863
It's there for you
if you want it.

366
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:13,864
See you in the morning.

367
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,434
Sit.

368
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,020
Okay, I guess I'm not
that great at chess.

369
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,675
You good.

370
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,765
Just... better.

371
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:45,896
Yeah, you're okay.

372
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:51,728
When I come America,

373
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,167
I not speak English,
but I play.

374
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:01,085
This, uh...
people speak same.

375
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,044
Like a universal language?

376
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:05,002
And you taught Kenny.

377
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,396
That's nice.

378
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,529
Fu-Hen.

379
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,747
What?

380
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,621
His name: Fu-Hen.

381
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,798
He want to be America.

382
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:22,498
He want America name.

383
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:33,640
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

384
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,078
I want my son!

385
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,862
It's okay.
He went home for the night.

386
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,908
He'll be back tomorrow.
Come on. Let's go.

387
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,910
It's okay.

388
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,739
Try to remember
where you are. Okay.

389
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,045
Okay. We're gonna do
a nice clean pull.

390
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:51,048
Nice and slow.
Now, it's gonna hurt a lot.

391
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,354
Yeah.

392
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,965
So we need him
as still as possible.

393
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,097
Boyd, hold on to his legs,

394
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,142
and you can hold
his neck area. Okay?

395
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,535
Uh-huh. Okay.

396
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,669
Ready?

397
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,453
Mm-hmm.

398
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,715
Here we go.

399
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:11,112
Okay.

400
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,940
All right.

401
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,942
-Ah! That's all right.

402
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,247
- That's all right!
- Please stop!

403
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,511
- It hurts! Ow!
- All right, all right!

404
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,599
That's it!

405
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,035
Okay. Good.
Hold him still!

406
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,254
- Daddy!
- Got it, got it, got it.

407
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,605
- Yeah, that's okay.
- Stop! Ow!

408
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,433
That's okay.

409
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,696
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

410
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:33,787
Got it! Got it. Okay.

411
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,223
All right.
Boyd, put pressure.

412
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,746
Put pressure
got it, yeah.

413
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,182
You did great.
You did so good.

414
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,270
You did great.

415
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,577
We're gonna patch
you up, okay?

416
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,624
Good, good, okay.

417
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:45,886
- Kristi? Hey, hey.
- Okay.

418
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,191
Breathe.

419
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,673
Okay.
Okay, you did great.

420
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:51,805
Here we go.

421
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,068
Just gonna
stitch him up.

422
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,776
I don't want to.

423
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:19,049
I can't.

424
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,877
I can't do any more.

425
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:27,406
Are you sure?

426
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,411
Okay.

427
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,069
I'm so sorry.

428
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,706
How?

429
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,604
All of it?

430
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,230
My mom's... my mom's probably
worried sick.

431
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,058
She'll be fine.

432
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,847
So I, uh, stopped
by the clinic the other day.

433
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,283
Yeah? Let me guess,

434
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,807
my dad try to rope you
into a game of chess.

435
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,287
Ah, he did.

436
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:13,860
Even when it gets bad, um,
you show him a chessboard

437
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,427
and he doesn't always remember
how the pieces work,

438
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,733
but he does
remember the game.

439
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,823
You know, he used to make me

440
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:25,088
play for hours when
I was a kid, and I hated it.

441
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,829
Really?

442
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,265
Now I, um...

443
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,489
Uh, anyway, Kristi,

444
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,926
I mean, she's just...

445
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,408
I mean, she just takes
such great care of him.

446
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:47,763
Look, Kenny,
they're gonna be okay...

447
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:51,637
Boyd, Kristi, all of 'em.

448
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,030
We're just gonna go out there
first thing in the morning.

449
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,989
We're gonna pick 'em up
and bring 'em home.

450
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,644
I'm not going.

451
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:00,950
Of course you are.

452
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,083
I can't.

453
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:06,129
I...

454
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,047
After what happened
to Lauren and Megan,

455
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:13,702
I feel like I'm
hanging on by a thread here.

456
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:21,014
I can't find
any more bodies.

457
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:22,885
I just can't.

458
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,254
Oh, fuck.

459
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:48,476
Hey.

460
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,738
Um...

461
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,305
Hey.

462
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:54,264
Uh, do, do you know
where Fatima is?

463
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:57,224
Yeah, she's just...
um, she's in the restroom.

464
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,012
Ah. Um...

465
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,145
You're... you're
Julie, right?

466
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,190
And you're Ellis.

467
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,105
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

468
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,109
Yeah.

469
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,547
Um, hey, look,

470
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:21,117
I'm sorry about what happened,
uh, downstairs earlier.

471
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:25,252
Um, have... have you had a
chance to see your mom yet?

472
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:27,080
No.

473
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,213
Uh, she's still talking to...

474
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,258
- To Donna?
- Donna, yeah.

475
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,476
Yeah, right.

476
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:33,782
Right.

477
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:36,655
Right.

478
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,051
I...
I like your drawings.

479
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,836
Thank you.

480
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,185
Yeah.

481
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,671
You're fucking crazy.

482
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,673
You don't know how many nights

483
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:57,197
I've laid awake
wishing that were true.

484
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,331
How many times did you drive
down that road today?

485
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,420
How many hours did
you spend in the car,

486
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,988
going in a straight line that
somehow ended up being a circle?

487
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,513
You saw those things outside.

488
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:10,601
No, no, no, no, no, no.

489
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,561
I don't know what I saw.

490
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,433
That's what my sister said.

491
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,435
Goddamn it, she was stubborn.

492
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,221
How about a drink?

493
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,833
Yep, I'm gonna
pour you a drink.

494
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:30,360
My sister,
she was a real character.

495
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,102
Not a woman to be trifled with,
I'll tell you that.

496
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,410
She'd kick the teeth
off a bear

497
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,760
if it looked
at her sideways.

498
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,332
Me and her, we were on
a little hunting trip

499
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,856
when we saw that
goddamn tree in the road.

500
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:53,079
That's right.
Everyone sees the tree.

501
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,430
Those
motherfucking crows.

502
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,565
It was right before sunset.

503
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,177
We'd already been
driving half the day.

504
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:06,005
There was a motel
a few miles back.

505
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,528
I said,
"Why don't we grab a room?

506
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,748
"Start fresh in the morning
when the tree is cleared."

507
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:12,315
But my sister didn't
want the deer to spoil.

508
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:14,404
Plus, we'd run outta beer.

509
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:18,495
It was already dark
when we got here.

510
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,585
First time through,
didn't even stop.

511
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:24,153
Saw some folks in the road,
drove right by.

512
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:27,591
Second time through, one of them
stood in front of the car.

513
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,463
Wouldn't get out of the way.

514
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:33,119
Just stood there, smiling.

515
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,732
I thought my sister was gonna
run the son of a bitch over.

516
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:41,431
She never did have much
patience for assholes.

517
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:46,959
Instead, she grabbed her
shotgun and got out of the car

518
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,353
and started screaming at it,
making all sorts of threats.

519
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:53,792
But it just stood
there, smiling.

520
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,101
I'll never forget
how it stood there.

521
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,364
So still.

522
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,369
And then
it ripped her face off,

523
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,243
right in front of me,
ripped it clean off.

524
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,550
Started skinning her with
its hands in the street,

525
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,161
just like we used
to skin those deer.

526
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:20,470
I couldn't move.
I couldn't breathe.

527
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,996
I just froze.

528
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,347
And then I saw another one
coming toward the car,

529
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:29,305
and that's when I ran.

530
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,830
I couldn't even tell you
which direction I ran.

531
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,875
They seemed to be everywhere.

532
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,446
So I found a place to hide,

533
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:42,144
some bushes at
the edge of the forest.

534
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,016
I crawled into them and hid.

535
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:50,413
That's what people
used to do to survive here.

536
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:55,288
They'd crawl into the bushes
or find a place to hide

537
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,334
and pray that they made it
through till morning.

538
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:03,470
So, there I was,
crouching in those bushes,

539
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,342
and when the blood stopped
pounding in my head,

540
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:09,041
I realized I could still
hear my sister screaming.

541
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,351
They weren't just killing her;
they were torturing her.

542
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:25,318
Those, uh,
things out there, they...

543
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:29,191
...they like to hunt,

544
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:32,716
they like to play,

545
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:34,936
so they were making it last.

546
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,506
And I just left her there.

547
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,206
See, you were lucky;

548
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:46,426
the sun was still
in the sky when you got here,

549
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,210
people came to help.

550
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,169
Not everybody gets that.

551
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:57,828
It's been, uh, three years,
six months and 17 days,

552
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:01,484
and I can still hear my sister
screaming in my head.

553
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,839
What is that?

554
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,365
Saline -
helps clean the wounds.

555
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:13,932
I thought saline comes in bags.

556
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:15,542
Well, we don't
exactly have much

557
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:17,283
in the way of
supplies around here.

558
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,894
Couple machines we stripped off
an ambulance a few years back,

559
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:23,289
but for the most part we just
improvise where we can.

560
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,291
So, what are...
are you a doctor?

561
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,510
I was a third-year
medical student.

562
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,426
Wasn't exactly
the residency I had in mind.

563
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,256
How about you?

564
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,519
Engineer.

565
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,608
I build theme park attractions.

566
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:42,047
Roller coasters,
drop towers, stuff like that.

567
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,659
What?

568
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:49,489
Nothing. It's just you're still
speaking in the present tense.

569
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:50,838
Hey.

570
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,405
Sorry.

571
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:54,320
Dad?

572
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:58,106
Hi, honey.

573
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:00,282
Hey.

574
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,154
How are you?

575
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,678
It hurts.

576
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,855
I know. You got
a little banged up, but...

577
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,466
I saw it.

578
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,338
What'd you see?

579
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:15,471
I saw the Lake of Tears.

580
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:20,476
It was a drawing
on the wall.

581
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,569
There were so many
drawings on the wall.

582
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:36,014
Like when I used to
draw with crayons

583
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,451
and you would
put it on the fridge?

584
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,636
And we were all there
in the drawings,

585
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,639
you and me...

586
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,381
and Mom and Julie.

587
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:10,004
But somebody screamed

588
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:13,181
because the spider
came down from the ceiling.

589
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:17,359
Hey.

590
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,275
You're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.

591
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:23,583
It's okay.

592
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,503
The doctor told us
that the dementia

593
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,983
was progressing
pretty rapidly, but...

594
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,247
I dunno.

595
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:36,857
He said, you know,

596
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:39,599
we should make sure to
lock the doors at night and...

597
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:43,342
and put a monitor on him,
maybe even strap him into bed.

598
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:44,865
Right.

599
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:47,737
None of which we did,
of course, because...

600
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:50,784
Hey, it's okay.

601
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,002
- It's fine.
- Come on.

602
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,875
Oh. I'm good. I'm good.

603
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,790
Kenny, maybe
we should, uh...

604
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,967
It was just hard,

605
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,665
you know,
to believe that he was...

606
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:09,542
So, one night,
he wanders out of the house,

607
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:13,720
and we didn't even know
he was gone at first.

608
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,766
He took the bus
all the way to the city.

609
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,423
My mom was so angry.

610
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:25,166
We drove out to pick him
up and she kept saying,

611
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:30,084
"Well, how could he do this?"
You know, "He knows better."

612
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:34,915
And I'm just like,
"Mom, he has dementia.

613
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,613
"He's not trying to
fucking piss you off."

614
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,922
Well, you know what?

615
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:43,793
The important thing
is you found him, right?

616
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,322
On the drive home,

617
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:53,412
I kept thinking,

618
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:56,632
we got a second
chance now, you know?

619
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,808
To do things right.

620
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:04,553
And then you saw the tree.

621
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:07,991
And then we saw the tree.

622
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:10,168
Yeah.

623
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,605
Can you guys maybe not sit in
the middle of the stairs?

624
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,999
Right. Uh, sorry.
Sorry about that.

625
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,392
We're just, uh...

626
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:22,136
Sorry.

627
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,486
Yeah, Kenny, you know what?
Maybe we should, uh...

628
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,360
Kenny?

629
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:47,683
Sara?

630
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:50,164
I was taking a nap.
I didn't hear you come in.

631
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,384
I'm gonna get
some dinner started.

632
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,482
I didn't have a choice.

633
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,224
Oh.

634
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:09,792
Shh.

635
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:13,622
Will you please help me?

636
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,719
Okay.
You get some rest.

637
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,634
I'm gonna go check
on the boy from the crash.

638
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:26,896
N-no.

639
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:29,421
This place, how...

640
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,815
how you say? Scary.

641
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,643
Night scary.

642
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:36,384
Nightmare?

643
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,130
When this...
when this no work,

644
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,567
that's nightmare.

645
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:48,614
Yeah, nightmare.

646
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,834
Okay.

647
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,926
You get some sleep.

648
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,939
So, how does this work?

649
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,854
Oh God, Jim, no. No!

650
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,159
-No!

00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:00,109
about the little girl in a room
filled with broken glass?

676
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:05,071
She knows the broken pieces
used to mean something.

677
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,161
She knows there's
something they must have been.

678
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,905
But all she can
see are the shards.

679
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:20,042
And when she tries
to put them back together,

680
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:21,827
they cut into her skin,

681
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:26,832
cutting deeper
and deeper,

682
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,878
and she bleeds
all over the floor.

683
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:36,842
But she keeps on trying.

684
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:40,802
She keeps trying because
she knows there's an answer.

685
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:42,935

a shape they used to make.

and it's just like
the broken glass.

689
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,774
They told me it had to look
like it was the monsters.

00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:26,462
It's ruined now.

You know, with my Dad,

716
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:38,126
every single game would
always end the same way.

717
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:40,781
I'd be down to my last piece,

718
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:43,044
and I'd just keep moving
'round the same three spaces,

719
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,437

Kenny...

Those things,

they walk;
they never run.

723
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:57,015
You ever notice that?

724
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:58,799
Yeah.

725
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,848
It's like they're taking
their time, because...

726
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:08,417
because they know there's only
so many places we can go.

727
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:17,383
I think we're running out of
spaces on the board, Sheriff.
