00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,837
and your father reached
for the phone and...

529
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:52,018
we just turned for one second...

530
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,542
just one fucking second...

531
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,676
and he rolled off the table.

[Sobbing]

533
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:09,165
Your father
is the love of my life.

534
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,432
But sometimes I see him and...

535
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:22,048
I hear
that fucking phone ring.

536
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:25,834
Why didn't you tell me that?

537
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,401
[Sighing]

538
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,972
Because no matter
how grown up you are,

539
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,714
you're always
gonna be my little girl.

540
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:41,763
So we pretended...

541
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,855
yeah, that everything was fine.

542
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,730
I think that just made
everything worse.

543
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,736
I'm sorry.

544
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:02,044
I'm sorry, too.

[Speaks Cantonese]

550
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:19,061
There's gonna be trouble if you
don't move outta the way!

00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,628
- Let us in!
- [Boyd] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

552
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,108
What the hell's going on?!

[Speaks Cantonese]

554
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:24,937
Tom, Eli,
what the hell are you doing?

555
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,156
We got people from Colony House
in our houses,

556
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,897
using our supplies!

557
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:30,377
If I gotta choose between me

558
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:32,335
and some asshole from
Colony House raiding this place,

559
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:35,034
- then it's gonna be me!
- Nobody's raiding anything!

560
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,644
Well, those things weren't
supposed to be able

561
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,429
to get into Colony House either,
and look how that turned out!

562
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,083
- Exactly.
- Alright. So then, you guys...

563
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,042
You just wanna
throw it all away?

564
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,044
Start acting like animals
and make it all worse?

565
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,133
Look, we're gonna
figure this out.

566
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:50,614
Just... just go home.

567
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,487
Just go home, please.

568
00:29:56,142 --> 00:30:00,494
[Grumbling indistinctly]

569
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:04,933
They... scared.

570
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,500
Yeah.

571
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:20,427
[Boyd]
Those things come out at night.

572
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:24,561
They walking around in
the forest during the daytime?

573
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:27,608
Not as far as we can tell.

574
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,393
[Boyd] There might be
resources out there.

575
00:30:30,524 --> 00:30:32,743
We go scavenging
during the daytime,

576
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,616
never know what
we might find.

577
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:38,575
Yeah.
Good luck findin' volunteers.

578
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:42,710
Right.
We'll work on that part.

579
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,494
How long were you
in the military?

580
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,976
Uh, almost 30 years.

581
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:49,848
Hm.

She's the badass
in the family.

00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:03,862
Yeah.

588

Mom, you okay?

589
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,575
Yeah.

590
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,838
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

591
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:27,102
I was just thinking
about this dream I had

592
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,930
when I was a little girl.

593
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,889
I was...

594
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,329
Never mind.
We should go help your dad.

595
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,200
Lots to do.

596
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,079
Can't go, not now.

597
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,168
Damn near had
a riot at the diner.

598
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,213
But this is exactly
why you said you had to go.

599
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,737
Things are coming apart.
It's already starting to happen.

600
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,739
We lost over a dozen people
last night.

601
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,699
And we'll lose more if...
if they start to panic.

602
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,483
- At least if you...
- Kenny, enough.

603
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,398
I'll stay until
things settle down.

604
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,618
And what if they don't?

605
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,576
What if they don't?

606
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:07,751
Am I interrupting?

607
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,014
No, come on in.

608
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,102
Sheriff, please...

609
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:13,583
Kenny, we're done. Okay?

610
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:16,499
We're not done.

[Stammers]

612
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,939
I said, we're not done.

613
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,116
You told me you had to go.

614
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,118
You told me
that I had to step up

615
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,903
and be strong
while you were gone.

616
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,731
You told me we were
running out of time,

617
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,299
and what part
of that's changed? Huh?

618
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,736
We've all been sitting
around the last few months,

619
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:37,477
acting like those
talismans were a solution.

620
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:40,349
Like they made us safe?

621
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,744
Well, guess what.
We were never safe.

622
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,181
Those talismans were a Band-Aid,

623
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:48,749
a... a temporary reprieve.

624
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,970
Things were never okay here,

625
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,974
and things are never
going to be okay here.

626
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:03,894
We need to find a way home

627
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,810
or else every
single person here

628
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,769
is gonna end up
exactly like Father Khatri.

629
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,514
There are answers out there,

630
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:17,473
and you're going to find them.

631
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,214
And in the meantime,

632
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,869
you need to get over
what happened last night.

633
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,218
You need to get
your shit together

634
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:25,307
and be the scary hard-ass
that you've always been

635
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,354
because that's who people
need you to be right now.

636
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:32,053
And if we're not gonna fight
like hell to go home,

637
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:34,664
then we might as well swallow
a fucking bullet right now.

638
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,625
Is that what you want?

639
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:54,771
I didn't know the little
bastard had that in him.

640
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,601
Now, how about you explain

641
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,864
what the fuck
he was talking about?

642
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:02,866
Where exactly are you going?

643
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:06,348
Let's take a walk.
I'll explain on the way.

644
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,264
Come on, man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,833
Come on!
Help me out a little bit here.

647

Hey!

648
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:16,924
Look what I found!

649
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,405
Okay, what? Where...
where did you...?

650
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:22,408
I... He was about half
a mile out, eating some grass.

651
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:23,974
There are chickens
out there too.

652
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,802
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna set up some traps.

653
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:26,847
There's chickens in the forest?

654
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,022
Yep.

655
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,111
Hey, you know what?
Grab some people.

656
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,505
We need to start rebuilding
that, uh, pen outside the barn.

657
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:33,854
Okay? Hey! Hey!

658
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:34,898
Hey.

659
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:36,552
- I found a goat.
- He got a goat.

660
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,032
Yeah, that's great.

661
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,382
Hey, uh, look,
I need to talk to you.

662
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,210
All right. Hey, could you
take him off my hands?

663
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:43,820
No.

664
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,039
Yeah, no, you got it.
Yeah, yeah.

665
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,606
He's not exactly what
I'd call cooperative,

666
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:47,607
but just hold the rope.

667
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:48,608
- Yeah.
- You got it.

668
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,175
- I, uh...
- You believe that?

669
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,481
I knew I was gonna find
something out in those woods.

670
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:54,831
I ain't think it was gonna be
livestock, but I'll take it.

671
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:55,919
Who knows what else might be...

672
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,486
You need to stop
going out there.

673
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,009
What?

674
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,447
It's Mom.
She's not doing well. Okay?

675
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,405
I mean, you've been going out
there for weeks now,

676
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,451
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

677
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,888
I think this place is, like,
starting to get to her.

678
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,325
Okay.

679
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:13,502
Look, I know you're scared, man.

680
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:18,333
I'm fricking terrified.
But do me a favor. Look around.

681
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:21,467
The things we are doing
are working.

682
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:24,034
There are things out
in those woods that can help us,

683
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,821
things that might even...
All I know, all I know is that

684
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:31,694
the second we stop looking for
answers, that's when we lose.

685
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,479
Okay, so, then why don't
we just get someone else

686
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,785
to go and look for a while?
Dad, we need you here.

687
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,874
Mom needs you here!

688
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:42,009
Okay, look, she... she's not...

689
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,142
You know, sometimes,
I-I see her just standing,

690
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:46,970
staring off in the middle
of the road, like she's...

691
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:50,365
Your mom... Your mom is
as tough as they come.

692
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,628
Iron Abby, remember?

693
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:56,589
Now, I know this is hard,
but this is what we have to do,

694
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,068
at least for now.

695
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,159
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying to you!

696
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:04,031
Look, look, okay, okay.
Look, look. Look, look.

697
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,034
We got about four hours
of daylight left, right?

698
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,950
Help your mom get everybody
secured, tucked away.

699
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,431
And when I get home
tonight, we will talk.

700
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,215
I promise.

701
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,914
Dad, please...

702
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:20,352

without saying goodbye.

884
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:52,337
This is not goodbye.

885
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:55,209
Okay? You hear me? Huh?

886
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,429
This is not goodbye.

887
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:58,430
Okay.

888
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,127
All right.

889
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:06,394
Hey.

890
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:09,919
What is she doing here?

891
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,574
[Stammers] Look, I need
to take her with me. Okay?

892
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:14,489
Wait, no, you know
what she tried to do!

893
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,535
No, no, no! Hey, look, look.
I need to take her with me

894
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:19,581
'cause she might be helpful
for us to find out

895
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:21,496
what we're looking
for out there, okay?

896
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:23,585
I will explain everything
to you when I get back.

897
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,326
We'll have a long conversation,

898
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:27,502
hopefully on our way
outta this place.

899
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:31,550
But for now, right now, I just
need you to trust me, okay?

900
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,856
Okay, no one can
know she's with me.

901
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,423
Can you do that for me?

902
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:38,339
[Stammers] Can you trust me?

903
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:44,389
Just come back.

904
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,782
Yes, sir.

905
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:49,350
All right.

906
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,787
Go on. Go.

907
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,224
I love you.

908
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,836
I love you, too.

909
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:59,186
[Chuckles]
Okay.

910
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,148
Yeah.

911
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:12,373
[Grunting]

912
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:14,941
Look, we're in a tight spot.

913
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,422
No one's gonna
pretend otherwise.

914
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,642
But Sheriff Boyd
is risking everything for us

915
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:22,601
out there in the forest.

916
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:24,994
The least we can do is...

917
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,649
keep ourselves
together while he does.

918
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,261
So that means that we're gonna
do things a little differently

919
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:31,566
going forwards.

920
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:34,874
No more Colony House,
no more town.

921
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:37,659
We're a community, so...

922
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,706
we do this together.

923
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,404
All you Colony House folk,

924
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:45,754
I don't want any of you
being shitty houseguests.

925
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:48,888
Now, we're gonna get
the house put back together,

926
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:50,846
but first of all,

927
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:53,545
Jim here has an idea about
a way we might be able to get

928
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:55,590
a signal to folks
back in the world.

929
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:58,680
So we can either
put our energy towards

930
00:51:58,811 --> 00:52:00,726
boarding up a bunch
of broken windows,

931
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:03,642
or we can help build
something that gets us all

932
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:06,340
out of this shithole.

933
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:07,341
Jim?

934
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:10,214
[Townspeople muttering]

935
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:14,653
Well, we're gonna need supplies,

936
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,569
anything we can get
our hands on.

937
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:20,441
We're gonna need batteries,
anything with a charge.

938
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:23,705
But most of all,
we're gonna need people.

939
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:26,534
The sooner we get this built,

940
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,536
the sooner we can all go home.
