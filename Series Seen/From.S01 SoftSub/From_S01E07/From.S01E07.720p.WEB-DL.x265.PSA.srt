00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:37,244
Come on in.

182
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,338
[Door closing, lock clicking]

183
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,626
Looks like you're
going somewhere.

184
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,326
Yeah. I was gonna come by and
talk to you about all this.

185
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,701
Well, we have more to
talk about than I thought.

186
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,683
[Tabitha sighs]

187
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,643
He's completely passed out.

188
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,644
Well, pretty sure

189
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:12,647
you violated
about a dozen child labor laws

190
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,432
by having him dig
in the basement all day.

191
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:17,980
No, he was having fun.
He just wanted to help.

192
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,702
I get so nervous every time
I take my eyes off him.

193
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,443
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

194
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:31,578
But, look,
windows are nailed shut.

195
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,625
The doors are locked.

196
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,539
He couldn't let one
of those things in if he tried.

197
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,349
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,982
Fuck! And then I think about
Julie up in that house.

199
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,202
Donna, the lady who runs
the place, she might be a...

200
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,945
[Chuckles]

201
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:52,207
but she's definitely not stupid.

202
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,231
Yeah.

203
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:56,604
How's it going?

204
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:58,605
Well...

205
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,433
provided I can
convince the sheriff

206
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:02,957
to let me use all of
their building materials,

207
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,831
not to mention drain every
single battery they've got,

208
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,571
and get Donna
to allow us to build

209
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,269
on the high ground
at Colony House,

210
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,618
should be just promising enough

211
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,837
for everyone to hate me
when it fails.

212
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,490
Oh, come on, don't say that.

213
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,231
You got a signal.

214
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,408
No, come on. I got static.

215
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,583
That's a far cry from a signal.

216
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,174
Well, but it's something.

217
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,177
Yeah.

218
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,182
Hey. Hey.

219
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,860
It matters.

220
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,818
And look,
look on the bright side,

221
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,559
at least we've got our hole in
the basement to fall back on.

222
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,735
Or in.

223
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,196
Or in. I'm gonna head back down.

224
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,113
Best get to it.

225
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:56,576
- [Music playing]
- [Indistinct chatter, laughter]

226
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,447
Oh, shit.

227
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:00,494
Hey, watch where
you're going, man. Fuck.

228
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,756
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hold on.

229
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,541
- Hey.
- Maybe slow down a little bit.

230
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:05,846
Hey, I'm I'm fine. I'm fine.

231
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,674
It's a party, right?

232
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,482
Don't worry.

233
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:14,769
Is everything okay?

234
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,945
Yeah, I think so.

235
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:18,817
He said not to worry,
so I'm going to worry.

236
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,864
[Donna] All right,
everybody settle down now!

237
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:24,474
- Everybody!
- We should go.

238
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:25,779
[Julie] Yeah, yeah, yes.

239
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:29,523
Hey, shut your fucking mouths!

240
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,524
[All laughing]

241
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:33,570
All right.

242
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:35,963
We are here tonight

243
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:39,359
to celebrate a very
special anniversary.

244
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:40,750
[Woman] Yeah.

245
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:42,341
One year ago today...

246
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,323
our dear sweet Fatima
came into our lives.

247
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:49,673
[Light cheering]

248
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,326
Some of you were here then,

249
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,070
many of you arrived since.

250
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:58,682
But all of you have
come to know her

251
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,683
and to love her,

252
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:04,731
for her kindness,
for her strength,

253
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:05,775
for her wisdom

254
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,386
And for her weed!

255
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,999
[All laughing]

256
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:13,523
The green thumb is
definitely a big plus.

257
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,134
[Laugh]

258
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:17,484
Our greenhouse
never smelled so good.

259
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,746
[Laugh]

260
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,532
But, uh, seriously,

261
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:26,100
the truth is...

262
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,711
you've made this big
old drafty box

263
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,015
feel a little bit
more like home.

264
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,674
Happy anniversary, sweet pea.

265
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,527
Donna...

266
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,183
Thank you.

267
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,498
This is so beautiful.

268
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,588
May it catch
all the bad dreams...

269
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,376
and let only
the sweet ones reach you.

270
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:03,946
- Come here.
- Thank you.

271
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:10,624
Oh. We are so lucky to have you.

272
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,322
So lucky to have...

273
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,585
- All right with the mushy.
- [Laughs]

274
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,544
All right, everybody,
you all know the protocol.

275
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,764
Drink, smoke, have fun,

276
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,855
keep an eye on each other.

277
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,639
- Cheers!
- [All] Cheers.

278
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:27,946
Cheers, baby.

279
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,644
- [Chattering]
- [Music playing]

280
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:33,515
Happy anniversary, gorgeous.

281
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,585
Thank you.

282
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,662
Look at what she got me.

283
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,967
She made this herself.

284
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,709
[Stacey] Aw!

285
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,190
So, that's the plan. Yup.

286
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:57,235
Find a way outta here
once and for all

287
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,263
before it all comes
crashing down around us.

288
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,441
Your turn.

289
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,666
I buried this bag
the day I arrived.

290
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,193
Open it.

291
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,331
Holding out on me?

292
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,424
This yours?

293
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,928
I'm not talking about the shirt.
I'm talking about the blood.

294
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:40,259
There's another item in the bag.

295
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:48,049
I mean, what what is it?
What the fuck is going on?

296
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:55,076
We've never really
discussed who we used to be...

297
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,538
before we came here.

298
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,240
[Exhales]

299
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:12,701
There was this young boy
in my congregation.

300
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:16,861
He was quiet, sensitive.

301
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,928
He used to get so excited

302
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:23,352
when his mother let him put a
dollar in the collection plate.

303
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,196
One day, after mass,

304
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:32,592
I found him lingering
outside the rectory

305
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:35,575
and it was unusual.

306
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:39,555
You know, he wasn't
really the type of kid

307
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:40,903
to stray too far
from his parents.

308
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,864
They were very, um...

309
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,672
strict...

310
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:51,175
rigid.

311
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,135
And I get it. Parents,
they worry about their kids,

312
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,770
and sometimes you have...

313
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,969
[Exhales]

314
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,971
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

315
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,300
[Exhales]

316
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:13,111
[Gasps]

317
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,854
Anyway, the point is...

318
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,531
the boy was upset.

319
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,034
He asked if he
could stay a while.

320
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:27,255
But I had to prepare
for evening mass

321
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:31,631
and I didn't want
the parents to worry.

322
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:37,787
So I, uh...

323
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,963
I went to my drawer and
I pulled out a candy bar.

324
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:45,515
I, uh I always keep a
stash for the neighborhood kids.

325
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:51,173
I could see he
didn't want to go.

326
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:58,180
But I handed it to him
and I sent him on his way.

327
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:06,752
Later that evening, I,
uh I went by the house.

328
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,257
It was a bit unorthodox.

329
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,086
You know, I'm not really in
the habit of making house calls,

330
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,895
but something was
nagging me and I just...

331
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:23,268
As I walked up the driveway,

332
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,835
the mother,
she came running out,

333
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:30,057
hysterical...

334
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,667
inconsolable.

335
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,390
She was...

336
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,761
And I could smell the alcohol

337
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,483
the moment I stepped
through the door.

338
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:46,160
The father was just...

339
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:48,030
standing there
with this panicked,

340
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:50,076
dumbfounded look on his face.

341
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:53,538
"Get up! Get up!" he said.

342
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:01,852
I walked over and I stepped in
the room, and there he was.

343
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:09,791
This sweet, innocent boy,

344
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:15,015
just laying there, broken.

345
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,259
His neck was bulging in a way
it was...

346
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,766
And I could see,
in his pocket...

347
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,661
the candy bar.

348
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,664
[Exhales unsteadily]

349
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,516
"He'll be fine."

350
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,759
That's what the father said.
"He'll be fine."

351
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,957
It was the way he said it.

352
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,590
Sounded indignant.

353
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:53,357
The next thing I knew,
I was on top of him,

354
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:56,098
smashing his face
as hard as I could.

355
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:59,015
I couldn't stop.

356
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,017
I just kept hitting
him over and over again.

357
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,019
I couldn't stop.

358
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,934
Even when I felt the bones
in my hand start to break,

359
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,959
I couldn't stop.

360
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:14,335
