1
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,358
<i>Previously, on From...</i>

2
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,360
Is Daddy coming home?

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,970
Any second now.

4
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,624
You go start saying
your prayers.

5
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:17,539
I'll be there
in a minute.

6
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:21,282
- Meagan, what are you doing?
- Maybe I can come in.

7
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,284
- Meagan, no!

8
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,246
You want a drink, huh?

9
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:30,813
- Get the...
- No.

10
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,336
A man protects
his family, Frank.

11
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:33,816
Open your eyes
and look!

12
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,297
Look at what you did.
Look at them.

13
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,602
No!

14
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,823
Tell my parents I said goodbye.

15
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,391
Mom, Julie killed Norman.

16
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,871
- What happened to Norman?
- The monsters killed them.

17
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:48,048
There's no such thing
as monsters, honey.

18
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,006
Why is there a tree
in the middle of the road?

19
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:52,356
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

20
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,706
Oh, this can't be
the same place.

21
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:57,448
Excuse me?

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,669
We're trying to get back onto
the highway. Could you...

23
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,324
-We're on the same fucking road.

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,945
Dad, I think he's bleeding.
There's something in his leg.

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,599
Are you a doctor?

26
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,079
I was a third-year
medical student.

27
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,517
Please stop.
It hurts. Ow!

28
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,867
-We can make it to Colony House.

29
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,695
Run as fast as you can,
no matter what you see.

30
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,914
No matter what you hear,
you do not stop.

31
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,830
-Hey, I need help here!

32
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,398
Hey. Hey! Donna, let us in!

33
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:37,662
You're from one
of those two cars?

34
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,360
That hasn't happened
in a long, long time.

35
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,058
What do you think it means?

36
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,452
There are things you need to
know about where you are.

37
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,281
This, unfortunately, is gonna be
the worst conversation

38
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,325
of your life.

39
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,892
Do you believe
in monsters?

40
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,676
Why did you bring me here?

41
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:54,157
'Cause I wanted you
to see that if you climb

42
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:57,813
high enough, even a nightmare
can look like a dream.

43
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:00,076
- This isn't your fault.
- What do you mean?

44
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,513
I hear their voices.

45
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,602
They said it was
the only way to go home.

46
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:05,908
Sara, just tell me
what you did.

47
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:08,128
I left the door open.

48
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,521
-Those things. They walk.

49
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,567
They never run.

50
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:15,570
They know there's only
so many places we can go.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,876
I feel like I'm hanging on
by a thread here.

52
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:22,707
I can't find any more bodies.

53
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,622
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

54
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:58,482
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Come on! Come on!

55
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,180
Open the damn door!

56
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,628
You have a bad dream?

57
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,325
Yeah.

58
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,850
Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,771
Tobey!

60
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,860
Somebody get me out of
this fucking thing. Hey!

61
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,862
- Tobey, where are you?
- What's going on?

62
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,212
Anybody fucking... Hey.

63
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,083
Shut the fuck up.
People are trying to sleep.

64
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,999
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry.

65
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,914
I'm usually more cordial
when I do this.

66
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,875
You picked one hell of a time
to finally wake up.

67
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,747
Listen. I don't know
what's going on here,

68
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,836
alright, but you get me outta
these fucking straps

69
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,403
right fucking now,
or I swear to God I'm...

70
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,231
What?

71
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,451
Do you have any idea
who I am?

72
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,018
Oh, shit.
You're one of those.

73
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,715
One of what?

74
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:58,890
Okay.

75
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,546
Let's start
at the beginning.

76
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,016
You hungry, Frank?

77
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,627
Anything you need?

78
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,938
Look.

79
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,027
It's important for you
to understand that

80
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:47,031
what happens tonight...
it's not personal.

81
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,121
I know.

82
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,605
She liked you.

83
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:58,129
Lauren.

84
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,653
She always liked you.

85
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,527
She said you were hard on people
'cause you had to be.

86
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,271
That you made the decisions
other people couldn't.

87
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,667
You're the one who was gonna
get everybody home.

88
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,900
I wasn't always
like this, you know.

89
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:34,557
None of us were.

90
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,908
Look.

91
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,737
If there's anything
you need,

92
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,044
anyone
you wanna see, maybe,

93
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:46,221
tie up loose ends...

94
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,571
There is one thing
I'd like to do.

95
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,358
So, you're telling me
that right now

96
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,013
I'm in a town I can't leave,

97
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,538
and that every night
when the sun goes down,

98
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:02,846
monsters come from
the forest to hunt us?

99
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,935
Monsters who, incidentally,

100
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,197
killed my friend
the other night.

101
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:07,808
Yeah.

102
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,554
Yeah.

103
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,211
Fuck off.

104
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:28,306
This is... this is something.

105
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:29,786
Where did he... where did he
find you?

106
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,527
Who?

107
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,224
Tobey.
Are you guys individual hires,

108
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,270
or is this one of
those traveling companies?

109
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,707
'Cause, I mean, you play
the whole thing pretty great.

110
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,057
I buy it.

111
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,406
Not him so much. I just...

112
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,365
I thought you were trying
a little bit too hard.

113
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,714
But otherwise, I...

114
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,240
Bravo.
Oh. Money well spent.

115
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,199
So, uh, okay.

116
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,505
So, what's next?
Is there, uh...

117
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,812
Is there, like, some kind of
puzzle I have to solve?

118
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,379
Mmm.

119
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,207
Actually, you know what?
Never mind.

120
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,165
- Don't spoil it for me.
- Where are you going?

121
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,995
Well, I'm not gonna
solve the puzzle

122
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,344
sitting here all day.

123
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,172
I'm gonna, you know,
check out the town,

124
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,044
turn over a few stones.

125
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,960
Fuck. Fuckin' Tobey.

126
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,309
This must have cost a fortune.

127
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,400
You want me to keep
an eye on him?

128
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,532
No.

129
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,534
Let him wander around town
for a while.

130
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,319
We got enough
to deal with here.

131
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,629
Ha.

132
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:35,330
Okay.

133
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,810
It's not quite
my Giacometti,

134
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,247
but, uh, it'll do.

135
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,988
Oh, perfect!

136
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,120
Is that for me?

137
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,774
Excuse me?

138
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,995
Hey. Do you, uh... do you have
anything motorized,

139
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,126
like a scooter or something?

140
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,258
What? No.

141
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,999
No? Okay.
This'll do. Thank you.

142
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,392
I... No, that's my...
Uh...

143
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,538
Hey, buddy.

144
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,235
Can I go outside today?

145
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,411
Oh, honey.

146
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,370
You need to stay in bed
a little longer.

147
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,068
I'm tired
of staying in bed.

148
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,506
And I don't like these pajamas.

149
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,465
They're itchy
and they don't fit right.

150
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:24,814
Oh, come on.

151
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,207
Your dad went to the RV
to get our stuff.

152
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:29,210
So tonight you're gonna sleep
in your own pajamas.

153
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,777
We all should've gone.

154
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,735
Well, we thought it was best
if Dad went on his own.

155
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,650
Well, I don't like people
going through my stuff.

156
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:35,999
Nobody's gonna do that.

157
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,305
Yeah, okay.

158
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,481
How long
are we gonna be here?

159
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,832
We are, uh...
we're figuring that out.

160
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,054
Hey. You hungry?

161
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,533
I saw they're making eggs.
Do you want some eggs?

162
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,145
Hobo eggs?

163
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,407
No. No, no, no.
No hobo eggs.

164
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,583
But they have oatmeal.

165
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,628
Okay.

166
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,674
What about you? You hungry?

167
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:01,068
Uh, no. I think I'm just
gonna go for a walk.

168
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,460
- Okay. Stay close.
- Yeah.

169
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,553
I am going to get you
your oatmeal.

170
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,251
Stay there.

171
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,863
Oh, jeez.

172
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,465
You okay?

173
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,820
Here. Let me get that.

174
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,891
One...

175
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,156
three...

176
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,985
four, five.

177
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,084
Berries?

178
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm okay.

179
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,178
There's an apple tree out back
if you'd prefer that.

180
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,183
I see you grow
your own food.

181
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,403
Supermarkets around here
are terrible, so...

182
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,539
Oh.

183
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,585
You're joking.

184
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,414
Ellis and your dad
are gonna be back soon.

185
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,850
You'll feel a lot better

186
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,634
once you have
some of your own things.

187
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,375
Yeah, I guess.

188
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,291
Hey.

189
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,947
You doing okay?

190
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,300
No. Not really.

191
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,128
Come here.

192
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,533
All right.

193
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,362
Let's see
what we got here, bud.

194
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,755
I heard you were getting
a little itchy, so...

195
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,670
Thank you, Dad.

196
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,281
You're welcome.

197
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,807
Um, how did it go?

198
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,767
It was, uh...
it was good.

199
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,465
Yeah?

200
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,380
Are my books in there?

201
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,730
Oh.

202
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,559
Books!
How did I forget books?

203
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:52,777
Dad...

204
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,866
Oh, let's see.
Maybe there's one.

205
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,607
Maybe I can find something.

206
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,784
Oh, wait a minute.
We have books.

207
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,744
What do we want?

208
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:06,400
Do we want Adventures of
the Grand Gooligog?

209
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,620
Flight of the Cromenockle?

210
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,666
-Ah. The Cromenockle.

211
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,276
That's my favorite.

212
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,017
Make the sound.

213
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:19,456
Make the sound? I have no idea
what you're even... doo-ooh!

214
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,255
She doesn't sound like that.

215
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,735
No?
Does it sound like...

216
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,871
No. Stop. Stop it.

217
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,742
Okay, okay, okay.

218
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,135
There's gonna be two
Cromenockles for you.

219
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,615
Two.

220
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,276
Two Cromenockles for the cave.

221
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,626
-Two Cromenockles for you.

222
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,889
Careful with your leg.

223
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,197
Julie, look.
We got our stuff.

224
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,720
Yeah. So I see.

225
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,592
- Hey, come here.
- Julie!

226
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,464
We're reading the Cromenockle.

227
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:11,682
Julie!

228
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,427
- Yeah. It's really funny.
- Hey.

229
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,689
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

230
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,039
Father Khatri is here

231
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,041
to talk to you about
the choosing ceremony.

232
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:24,260
What's the
choosing ceremony?

233
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,697
I'll let him fill you in.

234
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,048
All newcomers have to decide
where they're gonna live.

235
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,485
Here in Colony House
or down in the town.

236
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,835
It's just part of
how we do things here.

237
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:37,186
I'd like to take the both
of you, show you around.

238
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,406
Maybe take you to the house
you'd be staying in,

239
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:40,450
should you choose the town.

240
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,713
Well, I wanna come.

241
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,715
What?
This is about all of us, right?

242
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,065
I wanna see.

243
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,718
We need you to stay here
and be with Ethan.

244
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:50,156
Donna can watch Ethan.

245
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,637
Okay. Fine.

246
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,685
You guys go ahead.

247
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:58,903
Hey.

248
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:01,732
We won't be gone long.

249
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,256
Okay.

250
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,910
You know what?

251
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,130
Maybe I should stay.
I shouldn't leave her alone.

252
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,785
I think it's very important
that both of you see this.

253
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,482
It's gonna be okay.

254
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,310
She's a tough kid.

255
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,616
Takes after her mother.

256
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,531
-Come.

257
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,638
Good morning, everybody.

258
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,423
What's cooking today, huh?

259
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,644
Is this where I find
my next clue?

260
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,124
Is this where the, uh...

261
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:47,604
Is this where the monsters
jump from the shadows?

262
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:51,086
Uh, "Oh, what wonders
will avail themselves

263
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,002
in the quaint little
roadside diner

264
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,571
in which my guard
hath fallen?"

265
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,574
Huh?

266
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,184
I did some summer stock
back in the day.

267
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,404
Not bad, right?
Oh, thank you. I'm starving.

268
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,754
- What've we got?
- Hey. There's a line.

269
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,059
Look. I'm all
for authenticity,

270
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,409
but I'm also
really hungry,

271
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,454
and since y'all basically
work for me anyways,

272
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:12,629
it's kind of okay.

273
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,891
Ow. What the...

274
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,203
All right. Jeez.

275
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,249
People really
take all this seriously.

276
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,869
What are you doing here?

277
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:37,176
You promised
you'd stay home.

278
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,526
If I didn't show up,
they would have wondered why.

279
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,745
It'll be okay. I wanna help.

280
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,661
- Sara...
- I need to help.

281
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,100
You should get back to the barn.

282
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,625
- It'll be okay.
- Sara...

283
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,584
I promise.

284
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,205
It's the talismans
that keep them out.

285
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,685
Now, there are a number of
other precautions people take.

286
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,687
Nailing the windows shut,
for instance.

287
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,733
With a child in the house,
this is a must.

288
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,343
Why?

289
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,954
Well, there'll be nights
where these... these things,

290
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:20,828
they'll try to convince you
to let them in.

291
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,961
And children tend to be
most susceptible.

292
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:28,139
How are people walking around
like all this is normal?

293
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,880
Well, the people
who survive here

294
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,231
are the ones who adapt.

295
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,755
How exactly
do they do that?

296
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,454
The way someone who lives
on a fault line, for example.

297
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:39,629
They adapt to the notion

298
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,674
that the earth
could just open up

299
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,980
and swallow them
at any given moment.

300
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,765
They go on with their lives

301
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:48,334
because that reality is a part
of the world that they live in.

302
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,901
Look. I wish there was
an explanation I could give you

303
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,642
that would make
any of this easier.

304
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,818
But it's gonna be fine.

305
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,604
Okay? Just always remember.

306
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,084
Place the talisman by the door.
Cover your windows.

307
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,261
Nail your windows shut.

308
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:05,655
You do these things, your
family's going to be just fine.

309
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,875
Hey. Um, I'm sorry.
What's that?

310
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,579
Um, we call that the box.

311
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,366
It's our only form
of punishment we have here.

312
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:24,892
You see, the rules we live by
are meant to protect each other,

313
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,850
to keep each other safe.

314
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,766
And when someone's
actions or negligence

315
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,682
leads to the death
of a resident in town,

316
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:36,860
the only punishment for that
crime is a night in the box.

317
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,516
Jesus.

318
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:43,040
But you keep one of those
talismans in there, right?

319
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:44,477
No.

320
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,655
How many times
have you used it?

321
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,833
Tonight will be the first.

322
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,880
Look. Come.

323
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:59,187
- Your house is just up ahead.
- Yeah.

324
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,890
So, it's not much,
but it'll keep you comfortable

325
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,718
if you choose to live in town.

326
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,464
Looks like somebody's
already living here.

327
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:23,690
Um, there was a...

328
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,737
There was an incident
the night before you arrived.

329
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,915
The first we'd had in months.

330
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,179
What kind of incident?

331
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,834
The kind that happens
when people are careless.

332
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:01,510
It was a child?

333
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,207
Holy fuck.

334
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:05,514
Meagan and her mother Lauren.

335
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,650
The father was
passed out drunk

336
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,434
at the other end of town
when it happened.

337
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,135
This is what happens
when you break the rules.

338
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,104
Tabitha, wait.

339
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:31,279
No, Jim, I'm sorry.
I can't.

340
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,063
I can't do that right now.

341
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,674
You make it seem like
we have a choice.

342
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,197
Jim.

343
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,417
Jim, this is
fucking insane!

344
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:41,332
That woman and her little girl
were ripped apart.

345
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,770
Now they're putting the dad
in some fucking box at sundown

346
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,858
for those things to...

347
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:47,774
You heard
what the priest said.

348
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:49,079
If he'd have followed
the rules,

349
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,169
they'd all still be alive
right now.

350
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,868
Jim? Why are you...
why are you so eager

351
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,174
to take any of this
at face value, Jim?

352
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,702
Because I can still hear
those things whispering

353
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,094
outside the RV.

354
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:07,271
I can still hear them
tapping on the glass.

355
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:11,362
Tabby, whatever this is,
it's real, and we are stuck.

356
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,756
So we better figure out a way
to make the best of it.

357
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,978
'Cause we don't want to
end up like...

358
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,982
No, no, no. No.

359
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,948
This was Meagan's
favorite spot.

360
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,913
Put this swing here for her,

361
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,916
and she was
always wanting me

362
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:46,789
to push her higher and higher,

363
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,009
but Lauren was afraid
it wasn't safe.

364
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:58,279
You'll bury me next to them,
right?

365
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,933
Yeah.

366
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,892
Of course.

367
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,071
Okay.

368
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:09,856
I'll just be a few minutes here.

369
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,988
Okay.
Take whatever time you need.

370
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,232
All right, little guy.

371
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,929
Give that a try
and let me know how it feels.

372
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,067
Feel good?

373
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,330
It hurts my armpit.

374
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,550
Oh, it hurts your armpit?
Okay. Hold on.

375
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,336
Here. I'll add a little
extra padding there for you,

376
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:58,034
and if this feels good,
I'll tie it on later, okay?

377
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,209
Here. Try that.

378
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,430
Ready? Here.

379
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,127
Let's go
down the stairs here.

380
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,781
Take your time.
There you go, buddy.

381
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,697
Come on. Three, two, one.

382
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,786
Boom!

383
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,136
He's adorable.

384
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,400
Why are you doing this?

385
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:17,924
What do you mean?

386
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,708
You guys barely know us.

387
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,147
It's just what we do.

388
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,679
It's, like,
the ultimate escape room.

389
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:36,290
I mean, seriously, I don't know
how he pulled all this together.

390
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,945
So, um, I'm thinking

391
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:41,861
maybe there's a clue
in each one of the buildings?

392
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,037
Hmm?
Am I getting warmer?

393
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,387
'Cause I mean, usually,
you know,

394
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,258
you have some type of prompt
that lets you know

395
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,260
which direction to go.
But this is, uh...

396
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:52,175
This is just
some next-level shit.

397
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,049
Has, uh...

398
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,270
Has anyone
talked to you yet?

399
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:04,144
Yeah. The lady up at the, uh,
big house. Donna.

400
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,015
I mean, she gave me
the whole intro.

401
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,713
You know,
the monsters in the forest.

402
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:10,672
Tobey's dead. Blah, blah, blah.
But she didn't give me any hints

403
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,239
about where I'm supposed to go
next. Here's the thing, though.

404
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,894
Like, as thorough
as all this feels,

405
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:17,244
there's a couple flaws
in the logic.

406
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,899
I'm sitting here eating eggs
in a diner

407
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:22,075
in a place that's
supposed to be, what,

408
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,903
some kind of
mystical nightmare?

409
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,513
I mean,
I don't know about you,

410
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,342
but my nightmares
don't usually serve breakfast.

411
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:30,300
I suppose you're gonna tell me
you've got chickens

412
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,954
roaming around
in the big bad forest?

413
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,260
Yeah, but the chickens,
the cows?

414
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,436
We don't really know
where they come from.

415
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,046
Mmm.

416
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,354
That's actually not bad
for a nightmare breakfast.

417
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:45,881
I should probably get going.

418
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,321
Am I supposed to get anything
from you?

419
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:54,237
What?

420
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,457
I don't know. Like a clue

421
00:27:56,587 --> 00:28:01,288
or some kind of
cryptic direction?

422
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:04,334
You know what? Never mind.
I'll figure it out.

423
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:09,339
Thanks.

424
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,394
- Was that...
- The guy from the other car.

425
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:23,484
He's gonna get himself killed.

426
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:26,182
Um, are you hungry?
Have you eaten anything yet?

427
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,315
No, I'm fine. I just came
to check on you guys.

428
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,446
Right.

429
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:36,062
Okay.

430
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,151
How's she doing?

431
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,544
Well, she's...

432
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:43,199
Uh, like I said, denial is a
major part of our family tree.

433
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,342
Let's see, now.

434
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:56,517
Twelve.

435
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,215
Ten, 12.

436
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,435
Okay.

437
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,843
What are you doing?

438
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,194
I don't think you're supposed
to be out here.

439
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,543
Are you looking
for something?

440
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,066
Go away.

441
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:27,940
I can help you look.
I'm good at finding stuff.

442
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,377
I'm not looking.

443
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:32,553
I'm checking.

444
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,773
What are you checking?

445
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,039
You ask a lot of questions.

446
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,477
That was only three.

447
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,265
- I can help you check.
- No.

448
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,658
No, you're trouble.

449
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,920
Your mom or pop comes back

450
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,401
and they see you out here,
who gets blamed?

451
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:57,360
And Donna cuts me off.
Then no more peaches.

452
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:02,017
- What are you talking about?
- Just go away.

453
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,109
Have you seen the boy
who lives out here?

454
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,114
What?

455
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,289
Forget it.

456
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,683
No, no. Hold on.

457
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,817
What do you mean
"lives out here"?

458
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,471
He's always walking around
out here,

459
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:24,126
and I never see him inside.

460
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,475
So I figured he lived
out here somewhere.

461
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:28,435
Is that right?

462
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,958
We're friends.

463
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,572
Are you, now?

464
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:39,228
Well, it's good to have friends.

465
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,013
Okay.

466
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:43,885
Wait. Hey, come here.

467
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:53,025
I'm checking to see
if they've moved.

468
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,983
If what moved?

469
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,332
The trees.

470
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,378
- Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,467
Did they?

472
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,991
Don't know yet.
I'm not done checking.

473
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:05,515
Ethan?

474
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,431
Ethan, what the fuck?

475
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:10,172
Get back inside.
Mom told me to watch you.

476
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:13,567
Guess I gotta go.

477
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,134
Yeah.
I guess you'd better, then.

478
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,092
Will you let me know
about the trees?

479
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:18,311
I'll keep you looped.

480
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,052
Ethan, now.

481
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:21,618
Hey.

482
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,403
If you see that friend of yours,

483
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:26,536
tell him Victor says hello.

484
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,111
Don't talk to him.

485
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,373
Why?

486
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:38,809
Because he's creepy.

487
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,115
- No, he's not.
- Come on.

488
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,335
He's checking to see
if the trees moved.

489
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,990
Yeah, and
that's totally normal.

490
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:53,389
One, two.

491
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,797
Yahtzee.
All right, Tobey.

492
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,668
Let's see what you got.

493
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,728
Holy shit.

494
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,367
What the fuck?

495
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:19,519
Tobey, you're a fucking genius!

496
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,099
Ah. Woo!

497
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,772
That's a sight
I don't see very often.

498
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:58,688
Yeah, well...

499
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,430
Don't get used to it.

500
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,693
He's not answering.

501
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:08,350
Well, perhaps you're
not listening closely enough.

502
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,837
I can't do it.

503
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:20,667
Frank. The box.

504
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,193
Can't do it.

505
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,719
It was never supposed...

506
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,461
I built the goddamn box
as a deterrent.

507
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:34,376
It's supposed
to scare people.

508
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:38,424
I... can't.

509
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,297
All right.

510
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,085
Let's say you don't.

511
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,523
Let's say you absolve Frank
of all his crimes.

512
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,438
Then what?

513
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,659
What happens next time?

514
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,533
I mean, you warned him
on several occasions.

515
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:03,840
Very publicly,
I might add.

516
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:05,625
How do you think people
are gonna react

517
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:08,715
when you let Frank go?

518
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,586
How much weight
do you think the rules

519
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:14,721
that hold this town together
will carry?

520
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,897
Aren't you supposed to be
talking to me

521
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,594
about the virtues of mercy?

522
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:24,339
I see.

523
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,298
Is that
what you'd prefer?

524
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:30,519
Hey. I'd prefer not to put
a broken man in a fucking box

525
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,913
to be torn apart
when the sun goes down!

526
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,959
That's what I'd prefer.

527
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,527
I'm not gonna stand here
and pretend like

528
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,399
this is an easy decision.

529
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,183
Great.

530
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:44,446
But you built a guillotine
in the town square.

531
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:48,407
What do you think happens
when people realize

532
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:50,452
you lack the conviction
to use it?

533
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,457
You're a terrible
fucking priest.

534
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:56,545
You know that?

535
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:03,552
Fucking worst.

536
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,988
Now I'm cursing
in the house of the Lord.

537
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,860
What the fuck is this?

538
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,829
Goddamn it!

539
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,536
There's a little shack

540
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,235
about a hundred yards
beyond the tree line.

541
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:20,542
You take that,
you put it next to the door,

542
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:22,892
and you make whatever life
you can out there.

543
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,821
What are you gonna tell
everybody?

544
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:50,964
Thank you all for coming.

545
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:54,097
Today, our newcomers will choose
where they would like

546
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,882
to spend their days here
with us.

547
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,753
Should you choose
to spend your time

548
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,929
with the people of the town

549
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,194
to live by our rules for
the good of the community

550
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,240
until we find our way
back home,

551
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,808
you will select the rock.

552
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:11,114
Should you choose to join
with the people of Colony House

553
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:15,858
to live for today because
tomorrow is not guaranteed,

554
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,383
you will select the flower.

555
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:22,256
Now, once you have chosen,
this choice will be final.

556
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,215
- Like many of us here...
- Father Khatri?

557
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,827
Uh, sorry.
Do you mind if I, uh...

558
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,872
Uh, yeah. Sure.

559
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,704
Since we're all
gathered here,

560
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,838
figure I might as well address
the elephant in the room.

561
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:44,104
Been a lot of questions today
about Frank, the box,

562
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,150
the rules.

563
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:50,719
There is a fine line

564
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,854
between savagery
and consequence.

565
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:57,335
And if we're not willing...

566
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,775
Frank?

567
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,867
I'd like to say a few things,
if that's all right.

568
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,969
You know what I've been thinking
about these last couple of days,

569
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,841
sitting in my cell?

570
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,495
Christmas.

571
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:33,371
The last one me and Lauren
and Meagan had before we...

572
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,116
I was a good dad, you know?

573
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:43,685
I mean, I wasn't perfect,

574
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:47,472
but I wasn't like this.

575
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:52,520
That last Christmas, we got
Meagan her first dollhouse.

576
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,395
And when she saw it,
the look on her face...

577
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:04,924
I let this town,

578
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:08,971
those things in the woods,

579
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:12,671
I let them get
to my head, and...

580
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,803
I forgot what really mattered.

581
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:19,199
I... forgot that
if I'd just been

582
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,070
a little stronger...

583
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,685
there might have still been
a Christmas morning

584
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,470
waiting for us all
when we got home.

585
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,041
Don't let this place
take that away from you.

586
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,132
Okay?

587
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:42,875
You look after each other.
You take care of each other.

588
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,922
Remember what
you're living for.

589
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,058
I appreciate everything you're
trying to do for me, Sheriff.

590
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:55,888
No, I do. I really do.

591
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,588
But the only two things that I
love in this world are gone.

592
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,550
And I just wanna see
my girls again.

593
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:12,208
Wait! No! Don't go, Frank.

594
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:18,388
Goddamn, I love this!
It's scary.

595
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,348
It's, uh, dramatic. It's...

596
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,872
Okay. Whoa, big fella. Okay.

597
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,918
All right, okay.
Easy, easy.

598
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,223
Easy.

599
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,790
Pick one.

600
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,923
You need to fucking let me go.
Ow! What the fuck?

601
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,577
Pick one!

602
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:35,405
I'm gonna fucking sue you.
Ow! Okay. All right. Okay.

603
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,103
- All right. All right?
- Got it.

604
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,800
Let's go.

605
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,542
Ow. Damn it! Ow! Damn! Ah!

606
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,112
Oh, you have no idea how badly
you just fucked up, okay?

607
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:47,505
All right? No idea.

608
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:50,508
I am gonna...
I'm gonna fucking ruin you.

609
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,422
All right, I'm gonna fucking
ruin all of you!

610
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:55,251
Jade, let me show
you something.

611
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,864
Come on.

612
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:05,087
Frank, you don't
have to do this.

613
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:06,393
You shouldn't be making
decisions like this

614
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,481
when you're hurting.

615
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,396
No. Look.
I'm the most clear-minded

616
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,833
I've been in a long time.
Trust me.

617
00:42:11,964 --> 00:42:13,008
All right.

618
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:14,923
Let's get this done.

619
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,188
Are you living in town
or Colony House?

620
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,234
Town.

621
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:23,192
Sorry.

622
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:25,064
You each have to say it.

623
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,805
Oh, yeah. Town.

624
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:29,155
Ethan.

625
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:30,678
Town.

626
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,854
Okay.

627
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:34,116
Julie.

628
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,336
Colony House.

629
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:39,905
- What? No, no.
- No. She doesn't mean that.

630
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:41,167
Girl made her choice.

631
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:43,169
- Hold on a second.
- It's done.

632
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:44,866
- Ceremony is over.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

633
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:46,738
She can't make that decision.
She's underage.

634
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,609
- No.
- Mom, it's fine.

635
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,177
No, it's not fine.
Come and stay with your family.

636
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,700
You don't have
to do that, Julie.

637
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:54,702
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my daughter.

638
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,791
Now, there's no way
anyone's gonna expect us to...

639
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:58,314
Are you gonna say something?

640
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,142
Okay. Everybody
just hold on, okay?

641
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:01,927
Take a breath.

642
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:04,973
Ju... Julie, Julie.

643
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:07,193
Do you want to live
in Colony House?

644
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,502
Yeah.

645
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,896
-Why are you doing this?

646
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:18,421
She chose.
Your rules, Boyd, not mine.

647
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:19,814
No, you know what?
It's okay.

648
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,468
I change my mind. I go.
I choose Colony House.

649
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,774
- Tabitha, just...
- What?

650
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:24,297
I'm not standing here,
knowing that my daughter

651
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:27,343
- is in that fucking house.
- Everything is gonna be okay.

652
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:28,606
- No, it's not! Fucking no.
- Okay, look.

653
00:43:28,736 --> 00:43:29,694
- We're gonna fix this.
- There is nothing to fix.

654
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:32,697
Will you shut the fuck up?

655
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,443
Please, please,
don't do this now, right here.

656
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:43,185
My son will be up there.

657
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,753
I promise you
she will be looked after.

658
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,453
All right.

659
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:54,893
Uh, everybody,
the sun will be going down soon.

660
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,112
So, uh, thank you for coming.

661
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:58,940
It's okay.
I'll take care of him.

662
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:12,301
I'm done.

663
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:14,347
All right. Your boy,
the sheriff, crossed the line,

664
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:16,871
so just call me a car
or whatever,

665
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,222
'cause I'm fucking done.
Fuck.

666
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:23,661
I need you
to understand something.

667
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:26,664
No one is trying
to be cruel to you.

668
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,796
But you need to understand
what's going on.

669
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:31,103
Are you listening?
Did you hear what I just said?

670
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:33,279
I'm not interested.
Okay? This whole thing

671
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:35,716
lost its interest for me

672
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,805
the second that asshole
put his hands on me, and...

673
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,473
Okay, you know what?
This isn't funny anymore.

674
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,170
This, uh...

675
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,653
You hear me, guys?

676
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:04,005
It's not funny anymore!

677
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:05,441
This, uh...

678
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:17,497
Oh, God.

679
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:21,327
I... Oh, God.

680
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:25,418
Oh, God, Jesus.

681
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:29,030
Tobey?

682
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:41,739
All right, come on.

683
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:45,264
There he is.

684
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,189
You get
these people home, Sheriff.

685
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,452
I'll do everything I can.

686
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,107
Promise me?

687
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:48,066
Yeah, Frank.

688
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:49,502
I promise.

689
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,302
I'm ready.

690
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,150
Okay.

691
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,782
Careful. In you go.

692
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:43,181
There's one outside.

693
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:49,927
Let's get you settled in.

694
00:49:45,504 --> 00:49:49,290
This is, uh...
this is Jade.

695
00:49:58,517 --> 00:49:59,866
Uh, let's get you set up.

696
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:14,620
Are you and Daddy
gonna sleep in here?

697
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,883
Yeah, yeah.

698
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,799
We're all going to be together.

699
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:22,845
Is Julie
ever coming back?

700
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:25,544
Honey,
she's right up the hill.

701
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:27,676
You can see her
anytime you want.

702
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:29,548
- Okay.
- Okay?

703
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:33,856
Shall we have a read?

704
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,684
Yeah!

705
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:44,998
All right.

706
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:47,435
Last I remember,
it was chapter three.

707
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,307
Start from the beginning.

708
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:53,833
Yeah.
It has been a while.

709
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:59,404
Well, it all began
one sunny morning,

710
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:02,711
as a cat lay
comfortably basking in the sun,

711
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,409
in a beautiful green shire.

712
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,672
