1
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:12,708
Is anybody out there?

2
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,753
- All I got was some static.

3
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,494
But it worked.

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,366
I think if we get it up
over the tree line

5
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:21,760
and we get it enough power, I
think we could get a signal out.

6
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,676
- You went through a farway tree!
- Huh?

7
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,939
Victor said you can go
all sorts of places,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,724
so maybe he went
somewhere else.

9
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:30,334
We have to find him!

10
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:31,727
One step at a time.
Hey, Julie.

11
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,468
What's happening?

12
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,078
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

13
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:38,429
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,865
Has anyone seen Victor?

15
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:41,824
We have a legitimate chance here
to go home.

16
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:43,869
You know what? Just go.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,742
I'll stay here,
and I'll figure this out myself.

18
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,874
I know you've had
a hard time lately

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,008
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody,

20
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,879
but I just need you
to promise me, okay?

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,448
If it falls apart,
if you fall apart,

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,712
you'll talk to me,
you'll let me help.

23
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:04,325
It's okay.

24
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,283
This radio
might actually work.

25
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,329
What's it gonna be like for us?

26
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,074
This is the only place
we've ever known together.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,340
There's no power source.

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,559
You need electric?

29
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:23,648
Yeah.

30
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,699
The problem is you can't
plug anything in.

31
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,744
God knows, whatever's coming up
through those wires is still...

32
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,227
Holy shit.
I know how to do it.

33
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,535
What is it?

34
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,756
I think I hit the bottom.

35
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,584
- I can hear them! I can--

36
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:47,803
- No, no.

37
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,544
Talk to me.
Talk-- talk to me.

38
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:51,894
It was different this time.

39
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,766
It was a woman.
She said...

40
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,377
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

41
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:59,119
"that I was wrong.

42
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:03,471
There are things out here that
are worse than the monsters."

43
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,516
We shouldn't have come here.

44
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:09,607
Shh!
We're okay. We're okay.

45
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,609
I don't think we are.

46
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,760
"Let's go to the tower."

47
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,545
"Behold, the tower."

48
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,422
Hey, I know those guys.

49
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,077
You want me to tell you a story?

50
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,037
It's okay.
I can tell my own stories now.

51
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,909
Well, look at you.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,824
You're all grown up now, huh?

53
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,001
What's your story about?

54
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:59,701
They're trying to find
their way back home.

55
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,616
- Hello?

56
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm coming!
Calm down!

57
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,402
- Hello?

58
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,838
- What the hell?!
- Ha! I got it!

59
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,100
You got what?

60
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,015
Power problem.
I figured it out.

61
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,408
What?

62
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,975
- Where is...
- It's okay.

63
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,803
...your least favorite lamp?
This one. This is ugly.

64
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,761
- My what?
- Let's use this. Good morning!

65
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:17,980
I didn't wake you, did I?

66
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,764
What's going on?

67
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,157
No, no, no. Wait.
What are--

68
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,028
what are you doing?
This is not--

69
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,640
What is the biggest problem we
have with powering the signal?

70
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,469
Huh?
Can't plug anything in, right?

71
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,210
The outlets are fucked!
The-- Sorry.

72
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,778
These wires aren't even wires,
so by all rights,

73
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,476
this lamp shouldn't
even turn on.

74
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,696
But it does, right?

75
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,611
Which means that,

76
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,700
no matter what's going on
with the outlets or the wires,

77
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,833
what comes out here

78
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,401
is the electricity
that lights the bulb.

79
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,663
You follow me so far?

80
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,534
- Yes.
- Okay. All right.

81
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:56,671
Now, this, this came here
in the back of someone's car,

82
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,803
which means that,
by all accounts,

83
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,023
this item is completely useless

84
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,416
here in our
lovely little hamlet.

85
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,200
Go ahead.

86
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,463
But if we take
the ends of the wire,

87
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,987
all right,
and affix it to the socket -

88
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:13,078
the very place to which actual,

89
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,127
bona fide electricity is
somehow being delivered -

90
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,825
and we screw our little light
bulb here back in,

91
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,740
and then...

92
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,051
Madam.

93
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:34,883
Whoa!

94
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,711
Huh? You see?

95
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,583
With enough lamps
and enough wire...

96
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:40,889
We could turn Colony House
into a giant battery.

97
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,673
Yes!

98
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:46,590
Gold star for Tea Cup!

99
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,679
I'm sure you would have
figured it out eventually.

100
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,291
Hoo!

101
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:54,990
Do you guys have any snacks?
I'm feeling peckish.

102
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,481
Do you think they
know where they are?

103
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,699
What?

104
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,961
The bugs,

105
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:15,967
the cows, birds.

106
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,274
Do you think they know

107
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,232
the horrible things
they're surrounded by?

108
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,452
That they aren't where
they should be or...

109
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,936
Does Mr. Worm just think...

110
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:32,027
..."Here's some dirt,"
just like any other dirt?

111
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,899
You know,
if you cut a worm in half,

112
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,337
it grows back into two worms?

113
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,602
What's your point?

114
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,735
My point is worms
are fucking creepy.

115
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:48,522
I'm sure it feels
right at home here.

116
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,698
What do you think
dragged the tent?

117
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,656
I don't know.

118
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:59,054
Where do you think we are?

119
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,665
I think it's time we find out.

120
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,600

- Now, listen.

147
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:41,172
The trick to making this all
work is conducting wire. Right?

148
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,131
Just like the wire we're
gonna run from the radio

149
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,176
up to the roof of Colony House,

150
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:48,092
we need enough wire to run from
the lamps inside Colony House

151
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,964
out to the radio itself.

152
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,488
Tea Cup,
tell them where we get it.

153
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:56,144
Well, basically
anything with a cord

154
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,102
that came into town
in the back of someone's car -

155
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:01,541
appliances, electronics,

156
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:04,848
even the wiring harnesses
in the cars themselves.

157
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,111
Um, you know, that ambulance
outside the clinic?

158
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,983
Probably a gold mine.

159
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,028
Well, there's plenty
of stuff in storage here,

160
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,856
so my kids and I,
we're gonna start in there,

161
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,946
and anyone who wants
to join us is welcome to.

162
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,079
And the rest of you,
scour whatever you can.

163
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,560
If we can get enough wire
stripped and spliced,

164
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,387
we can be sending out a
transmission before nightfall.

165
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,347
All right,
you heard the man.

166
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,088
Spread the word
and let's get to work.

167
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,307
Let's go, people. Chop, chop.

168
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,700
Yep.

169
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,400
All right, nice job, man.

170
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,272
Sorry. Gotta go.

171
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,017
Hey! Hey!

172
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,627
His name is Jim!

173
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,063
What?

174
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,283
My father's name is Jim.

175
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,460
Uh, yeah. No,
I actually, uh-- I knew that.

176
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,244
You're such an asshole.

177
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,985
I'm sorry. Am I...?

178
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,987
What am I supposed to do here?

179
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,467
Julie?

180
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,904
It's fine.
I'll be right there.

181
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,732
Oh, okay, all right.

182
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,778
This is like a...

183
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,171
It's like
a father-daughter thing.

184
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,133
This is, uh--
this is a really nice moment.

185
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,351
You're standing up for your dad.

186
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,310
Good for you.

187
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,311
Just cut out the 'Tea Cup' shit.

188
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,313
Fine.

189
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,097
But I'm calling you
'Spark Plug' from now on.

190
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,839
I like you. Good talk.

191
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,928
- I'll see you up there.

192
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:43,381
You missed Jade's big speech.

193
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,515
Yeah, probably for the best.

194
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,560
I thought you'd be
up at the house by now.

195
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,911
No, I'm gonna
help Kristi gather

196
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,436
whatever wire she can
from the ambulance.

197
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,787
All those different places,

198
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,528
different roads,

199
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,139
yet everybody ended up here.

200
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,666
You really think sending out

201
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,319
some radio signal's
gonna make a difference?

202
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,322
I hope so.

203
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,498
Radio waves travel
in ways that we can't,

204
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,849
so who knows, right?

205
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,504
Yeah.

206
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,942
Well, best get at it, I guess.

207
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:25,946
Thank you.

208
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:57,717
So, how does Troy feel
about giving up the goods?

209
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,371
Well, I mean, he wasn't
thrilled about it,

210
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:01,721
but we had a little chat.

211
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,117
What's with the lamp?

212
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:09,424
Uh, I had this
in the trunk of my car

213
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,731
when we drove in.

214
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,429
It, uh-- it was my desk lamp
back in college.

215
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,388
Cute.

216
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,740
It, uh, doesn't work here, and I
can't even plug it in, but, uh,

217
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,872
it was nice to have
something from home

218
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,613
that was close by, you know?

219
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,224
The globe actually opens up.

220
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,661
My roommate in college
was a bit of a klepto,

221
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,360
so it was kinda like
my secret hiding spot.

222
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,361
Really?

223
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,536
Yeah.

224
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,407
What do you keep in there now?

225
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,279
Funny you should ask.

226
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,414
Back, uh-- back in school,

227
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:46,591
I used to sit
at my desk sometimes,

228
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,638
staring at all
the different countries,

229
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,249
thinking about all the places
I'd travel to someday.

230
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,251
When I got here,

231
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:57,167
I actually started writing
some of those places down.

232
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:59,604
Everywhere I'd go,

233
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:00,997
everything I'd see...

234
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,437
...if we ever got to go home.

235
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,094
Let's see it.

236
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,010
Hand it over.

237
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:19,973
Oh, man. I remember these.

238
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:23,628
The infamous drug store receipt.

239
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,152
This is quite a list.

240
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,806
I had a lot of time.

241
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,592
Costa Rica, Hawaii...

242
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,421
Iceland - nice.

243
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,250
Well, have you-- have you been?

244
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,513
I hardly got past
Grand Rapids.

245
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:41,821
Always wanted to, though.

246
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,476
Well, maybe--

247
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:49,306
if this radio
thing works, maybe...

248
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,265
maybe we could go...

249
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,180
together.

250
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,660
Uh...

251
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,533
It doesn't have to be Iceland.
I mean, there's--

252
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,404
there's a lot of choices
on that list, you know?

253
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,362
Yeah.

254
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,845
Look, Kenny...

255
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,066
I like you...

256
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,462
a lot.

257
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,510
But...

258
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,646
I'm engaged.

259
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:31,392
You know that.

260
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,524
No. Right. I-I do.

261
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,745
Uh, no, I get it.

262
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,878
I shouldn't-- I'm so sorry.

263
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,662
I shouldn't have, uh...

264
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,751
I-I'm gonna...

265
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,710
I'm gonna take this first batch
of wires up to the house

266
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,713
because they're probably
itching to get started.

267
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,498
Um, I'll see you up there.

268
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,326
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,458
Okay.

270
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,330
Okay.

271
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,736
Ah, bit of a wreck,

272
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,564
but you should be able
to find something in there

273
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:14,565
that'll do the trick.

274
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,524
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

275
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:18,265
Gimme a holler
if you need anything.

276
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,615
Okay.

277
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,487
Hey, how come you're not up
there at the Colony House

278
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:24,749
with everyone else?

279
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,622
You mean why aren't I
working on the magic tower

280
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:28,710
that's gonna bring
everybody home?

281
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,147
Yeah.

282
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:32,714
You don't think
it's gonna work?

283
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,803
Ah.

284
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,892
Let's just say I've seen a lot
of people with clever ideas

285
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,199
about how they're
gonna get out of here.

286
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,679
You wanna know what
they all had in common?

287
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,421
They always end up at the bar.

288
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,642
- Happy hunting.
- Yeah.

289
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,582
She said she had some
stuff in the basement...

290
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:19,369
Hi.

291
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,415
Hey.

292
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:22,590
Can I talk to you
for a second?

293
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,810
Yeah, of course.

294
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,378
Uh, not here.
I need you to come with me.

295
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,817
We have a lot to do here.

296
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,689
Yeah. I know. I know,
but it's-- it's important.

297
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:38,693
Um, yeah.
Let me just, um...

298
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,825
Yeah, just put that right here.
We'll be right back, okay?

299
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,610
- Come on.

300
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,315
- Ellis, where are we going?
- Just a little further.

301
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,712
All right, and we're here.

302
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,586
We're where?

303
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:03,805
Well, this is
where I was standing

304
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:07,026
the very first moment
that I saw you.

305
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,637
You were driving around
in your little Volkswagen Bug,

306
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,857
going around and around
for hours.

307
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,990
You hadn't even had
your tires blown out yet,

308
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,645
but you pulled over
right over there.

309
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,648
You stepped outta your car
and looked around.

310
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,564
I remember.

311
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,609
I asked Corey for directions.

312
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,698
Yeah.

313
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,659
What are we doing?

314
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,791
Well...

315
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:38,579
I've been thinking a lot...

316
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:39,884
about what you said,

317
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:42,887
about going home,

318
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,847
about who we'd be,

319
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:48,980
and, you know,
I realized something -

320
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,722
I don't even remember
anymore who I was

321
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,637
before you stepped
out of that car.

322
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:59,730
And I don't want to
find out who I am without you.

323
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:02,603
Ellis.

324
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,092
You are the love of my life.

325
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,662
And we could be anywhere.

326
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,055
I mean, we could be here,
we could be there,

327
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,101
we could be anywhere
in the world,

328
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,755
but it would not matter
because you are my home.

329
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,759
And I would really
like to be yours.

330
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,120
I love you.

331
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,127
Okay, wait.
Is there a "but" coming?

332
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,695
There's no "but."

333
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,567
Okay, um...

334
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:58,876
Here.

335
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:02,967
So, unfortunately, all of
the jewelry shops were closed,

336
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,927
but I got you this really
stylish piece of wire.

337
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,757
Is that from my pile?

338
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:10,932
Yes.

339
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
Hey. What--
what's wrong?

340
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,166
Your dad's gonna
be really happy.

341
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,743
Where are we going?

342
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,963
Well, the light
came from this direction.

343
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:45,662
So, we're just
marching towards it?

344
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,970
Yeah, that's it.

345
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,841
Do you think
that's a good idea?

346
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,974
You got a better one?

347
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,715
Did you even hear
what I said last night?

348
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:55,803
Yeah, I heard you.

349
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,544
Will you just stop, please?

350
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:59,198
Look.

351
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,635
Look, we got dragged out
into the middle of nowhere

352
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:04,551
by God knows what.

353
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:07,118
I-I don't even know which
direction is back to town.

354
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,816
All I do know is that
someone shined a light

355
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,731
from that direction.

356
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,123
And that wasn't a flashlight.

357
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,909
That was a floodlight,
maybe a searchlight,

358
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,041
which means that maybe
there's someone or something

359
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,869
out this way that can help us.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,741
So we're going that way.

361
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,266
And what if whoever it is
doesn't want to help?

362
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,225
Then we got a different kind
of problem on our hands.

363
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,708
The voice I heard last night,
it was different.

364
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,883
It wasn't like the others.

365
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,930
Yeah, you said.

366
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,018
Who is Mr. Fish and Loaves?

367
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,066
It's me.

368
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,025
Mr. Fish and Loaves -

369
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:47,202
it's a nickname I had
back in the service.

370
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,683
Only two people who would've
known that name is Ellis--

371
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:50,814
And your wife.

372
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,644
Yeah.

373
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,386
Do you think she...?

374
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:58,822
What?

375
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:01,782
What are you asking me?

376
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,959
Did my dead wife
send you a message?

377
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,917
Is that what
you wanna know?

378
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,832
You brought me out here because
you thought I could help.

379
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:10,965
Okay?
Look where we are!

380
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,968
Whoever or whatever that voice
was, it told us to go back.

381
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:16,100
It told us what would happen
if we stayed out here.

382
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,015
Well, unless it told you
which direction to--

383
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,408
Help!

384
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,106
Boyd, what's wrong?

385
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,021
Someone please, help me!

386
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,764
Boyd?

387
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:28,765
Hello?

388
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,856
Where are you?
Keep talking!

389
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:35,119
Boyd, who are
you talking to?

390
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,904
I'm over here. Help!

391
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:37,905
Where? I can't...

392
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,434
Boyd, stop!
What are you doing?

393
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:46,783
Shh!

394
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:54,835
Abby?

395
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:00,971
Abby? Babe?

396
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,758
No, no! No!

397
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,760
No! No!

398
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,461
Ahh! Ayy!

399
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,991
Ahh!

400
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,951
Ugh! God!

401
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:26,954
Wait! Oh!

402
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,959
What the...? Ow!

403
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,526
Ahh! Get it--

404
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:34,962
I got it! I got it!

405
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,833
Ahh...

406
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,148
What did you see?

407
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,936
Nothing. Nothing.

408
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:07,995
Hey, guys.

409
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:13,087
How are you gonna
get it up there?

410
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:14,131
Well, we're gonna hoist it.

411
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:21,225
Yeah, see, once we get
the antennae up on the roof,

412
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,053
they'll be tall enough

413
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,186
to broadcast a signal
out over the treetops.

414
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,187
Cool.

415
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,634
You okay?

416
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,854
Yeah, I'm good.

417
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,031
I'm gonna go inside
and see if anybody needs help.

418
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,819
I'm here if you need me.

419
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,996
Okay.

420
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,172
I wish Victor was here.

421
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:58,219
I bet he'd really
like this.

422
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,569
Well, I'm sure,
wherever he is, he's okay.

423
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,615
Oh, I know.

424
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:05,226
He's got to do
his part right now.

425
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:08,838
- His part?
- Of the quest.

426
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,928
He's probably doing something
pretty important right now.

427
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,017
That's his part.

428
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:16,455
Doing this is our part.

429
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:19,675
That's right.

430
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:21,372
Boyd, slow down.

431
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,114
I'm fine.
Just keep moving.

432
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,899
We should look
at those spider bites.

433
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,422
I said I'm fine.

434
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:30,120
No, you're not.
What happened back there?

435
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,470
Don't worry about it.

436
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,386
You heard something,
didn't you?

437
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,867
I need you to
talk to me, please!

438
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,131
What?

439
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,829
What do you
wanna talk about?

440
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:46,833
You wanna talk about providence?

441
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:49,966
'Cause there's no way out.
Is there?

442
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:55,668
This fucking place!

443
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:58,366
This place...

444
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,021
fucking makes you think that
you're doing the right thing.

445
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:03,545
It gives you hope, then it...

446
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:07,244
then it takes it away,
like it's feeding on your pain.

447
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,204
You want to feed on my pain?
You want my pain?

448
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,989
You want fuckin' pain?!
You want my fuckin' pain?!

Towards the light.
Remember?

I had to come back to
the States, live with my uncle.

want to leave France

Okay.

531
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,328
So, take the screwdriver,
and we touch it to the coil,

532
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,808

determines the frequency.

along the coil,

00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:58,394
Hey people, we got snacks!

542
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,527
How we doing?

543
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:01,789
How are you doing?

544
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,399
Uh, I'm fine.
I got waylaid.

545
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,227
Are you happy?

546
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,707
Just get up on the roof.
We're about to start.

547
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,188
Oh, wait a second.

548
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:19,415
All right, ding-dongs,
it's almost go time.

549
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,417
Anybody fucks this up,
you spend a night in the box.

550
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,376
No one is going in the box.

551
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,508
Whatever.
Hey, pass these out, would you?

552
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,380
Okay.

553
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,251
Anybody wants it,
help yourselves.

554
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,558
Woo! Ha-ha!

555
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:32,733
- Hey!

556
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:33,777
Cucumbers are ready!

557
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:36,693
Stop! You! Stop.

558
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:39,044
Jesus Christ.

559
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,180
Hey.

560
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,270
Hi.

561
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:53,406
Pretty exciting stuff
out there.

562
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,103
Yeah.

563
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,195
You, uh--

564
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,023
You left your lamp thing.

565
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,156
Oh.

566
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,419
Forgot it.

567
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,769
Thanks.

568
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:11,293
I'm, um...

569
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,470
I'm sorry if I made things
weird. I--

570
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:15,994
No. Just, hold on.

571
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:19,736
I actually came here to talk you
about something.

572
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,131
Okay.

573
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,178
I don't know what to do.

574
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:33,315
And, uh, that
really freaks me out

575
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,623
'cause, uh, part of me
really wants to go back

576
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,712
to Michigan one day

577
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:41,410
and find out the woman I fell
in love with waited for me,

578
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:44,848
that she's still there, that...

579
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:47,329
that she didn't move on,

580
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,203
and that we can pick up
where we left off

581
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,337
and get married and...

582
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,165
start our life together.

583
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,999
What does the other part want?

584
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,870
To go to Iceland
with the most amazing guy

585
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:11,049
I met in the most
fucked-up place imaginable.

586
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:22,408
Oh, those two sound
like pretty good options.

587
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,062
Yeah.

588
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,848
What are you gonna do?

589
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,685
I don't know.

590
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,345
All right, guys,
you ready up there?

591
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:49,696
Yep.
Uh, just hold on a second!

592
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,089
I wanna see this. Wait!

593
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:00,924
- Hey!
- Hey.

594
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:02,883
You guys set?

595
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:04,493
All right, we're good!

596
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,629
All right, you ready?

597
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,413
- Let 'er rip.
- Lift off!

598
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:12,849
Lift off.

599
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,460
All right.
Liftoff, guys. Come on.

600
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,115
Here you go. Ready?

601
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,640
Come on! Come on.

602
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,294
That's it, nice and easy.

603
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,947
That's it, that's it!

604
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:26,298
There we go.

605
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:34,523
Nice and easy. Slowly.

606
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,527
We're secure!

607
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,405
Come here.
All right. Good job.

608
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,667
All right,
now it's time to see

609
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:48,972
if this thing
will actually work.

610
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,713
It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

611
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:53,281
Okay, everybody, that's you!
Go, go, go, go!

612
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:55,936
All right.

613
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:00,288
Okay!

614
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:02,595
On three.

615
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,814
One, two...

616
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:05,989
- Come on!
- ...three!

617
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,558
Come on. Let's go.

618
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,169
Oh, my God.
Don't touch it.

619
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,394
It's working.

620
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,703
We got power!
We got a signal!

621
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,488
Yes! Ah! Come on!

622
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,360
- Yes!

623
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:33,321
Come here, baby!

624
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,583
Yes!

625
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,585
Hey, listen!

626
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,632
If you guys are all done
stroking each other down there,

627
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,677
you might wanna start
transmitting sometime today!

628
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,899
Hey, I am so proud of you.

629
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:49,642
But I have to go now.

630
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:50,991
What?

631
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,340
Plan B!

632
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,039
I love you.

633
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,867
I love you, too.

634
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,525
All right, come here.
You wanna do it?

635
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:06,311
No.
You do it. You do it. You do it.

636
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:10,140
Hey!

637
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,404
You see those clouds
out there?

638
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,804
Motherfucker.

639
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,459
We should find shelter.

640
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,767
Once we get up the hill, we...

641
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:31,074
Okay, I just...

642
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:33,512
You go ahead.

643
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,557
I-I just need to sit a minute.

644
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,995
No sitting.

645
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,606
We keep moving.

646
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,129
Come on.
We're almost over the hill.

647
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,436
- I can't--

648
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,656
You hear that?

649
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,484
We're going in
the right direction.

650
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,356
We just...

651
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,751
We just need to keep going.

652
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,754
Almost there.

653
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,933
Almost there.

654
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:20,036
♪

655
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:43,973
Right here, on this one.
On top, on top.

656
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,845
Remember?
That's it.

657
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:50,023
Mayday. Mayday.

658
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:52,634
Can anyone out there hear me?
This is an SOS call.

659
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,419
We need help. Mayday.

660

Right, next one.

661
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,562
Mayday. Mayday.
Can anyone out there hear me?

662
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:10,565
This is an SOS call.
We need help.

663
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:13,525

This is an SOS call.

667
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,016
Mayday.

668
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,801
That storm's
coming in pretty quick.

669
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,672
You need to pack it in,
start again tomorrow.

670
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,718
Why don't we just give it
a few more minutes?

671
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:34,763
You have got about ten minutes

672
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:37,592
before the wind blows that
goddamn tower off the roof.

673
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,072
You need to get your boy inside.

674
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,728
All right. Go in the house.

675
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,338
- I wanna stay.
- Listen to me. Go in the house.

676
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,426
I'll be in
in a few minutes, okay?

677
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:49,561
Everything's fine.
Hand it over. Go on.

678
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,127
It's gonna be okay.

679
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,567
Here, give me that.

680
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:56,655
All right, what you gotta do--

681
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:58,744
Yeah, I know.

682
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:01,050
Remember, we lose this radio,
and the whole thing's done.

683
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:10,190
Mayday. Mayday.

684
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,627
Is anybody out there?
Does anybody read me?

685
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,673
This is an SOS call. Mayday.

686
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,633
Oh, Jim,
we need to stop!

687
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:22,158
Fuck! Ugh.
All right, um...

688
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,596
Hello?

689
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,554
Hello?
Is there someone there?

690
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,646
Uh, yes, yes, we're here! Uh...

691
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,605
Oh, my God,
you have no idea, um...

692
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,650
Oh, Jesus.

693
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:37,086
Uh, listen, we don't
have very much time.

694
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:39,219
Where are you?

695
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,569
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
Is this Jim?

696
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:45,747
Sorry. What?

697
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:48,054
Jim Matthews?

698
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,275
Who is this?

699
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:55,453
Your wife shouldn't be
digging that hole, Jim.

700
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,110
Watch my kids.

701
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,722
Watch my kids!

702
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:05,245
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

703
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,116
Move!
Hey, what happened?

704
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:07,943
Where's he going?

705
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,597
He, um...

706
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,164
Donna, what happened?

707
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,155
What the fuck?

708
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,606
You're here.

709
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,176
He said that you would come.

710
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,352
What?

711
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:11,529
The Boy in White.

712
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:14,270
He said that you would come,
that I should wait.

713
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,842
We have to go.

714
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:22,975
It's not safe here.

715
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:26,282
This is where they sleep.

716
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:27,370
What?

717
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:33,115
You see?
They make drawings too.

718
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,686
Oh, my God.

719
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,691
We have to go.

720
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:45,693
We have to go now!

721
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,695
Now!

722
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:52,700
Tabitha!

723
00:42:58,184 --> 00:42:59,707
