00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,218
[scoffs]

177
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,054
What are you doing?

178
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,725
Trina told me what happened.
You took her and Devon to a sex party?

179
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,310
What? No. Trina took me.

180
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,854
Oh, please.

181
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,567
Trina would never. You're the one
who was cheating on your husband.

182
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,277
- I didn't cheat.
- Really?

183
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,157
You admitted in the middle of SoHo that
you've been fantasizing about your ex.

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
And Trina told me that he called you
when you were at my house,

185
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,620
and you snuck out
into my backyard to answer it.

186
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,707
You know what, Caroline?
I never judged you for hating sex.

187
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,792
Maybe don't judge me for liking it.

188
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,877
[scoffs]

189
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,256
I saw Devon's face. What Cooper did...

190
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,050
- Cooper feels terrible.
- I don't blame him.

191
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,596
I blame you. You have dragged
your husband through the mud.

192
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,142
If you two are still together
at Christmas, I'll eat my shirt.

193
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,227
[dramatic music playing]

194
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,231
[elevator dings]

195
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,560
- [Cooper] Morning.
- Morning.

196
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,491
[indistinct chatter]

197
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,922
Cooper, thanks for joining.

198
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,839
Have a seat.

199
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,975
Brutal, right?

200
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,728
Told me he was jumped in Greenwich.
Who knew?

201
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,438
[clears throat]

202
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,606
What's going on?

203
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:41,070
Devon here is trying to sell me
on his residential hydropower idea.

204
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,488
Again.

205
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,948
I think it's risky.

206
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,867
It's a crowded field, and I don't think
the numbers are there,

207
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,287
but according to Devon,
you think it's a winner.

208
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,458
And since you're the golden boy
around here after Nanogenics,

209
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,295
if you think there's something in it,
then I need to reconsider.

210
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,506
You know we have limited resources.

211
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,467
Is this how you think
we should we spending them?

212
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,097
[clears throat]

213
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,267
Yes.

214
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,727
Yes, it is.

215
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,774
Well, all right, then. [clears throat]

216
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,568
Now, it is a crowded field,

217
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,571
so maybe not the full investment
that Devon's talking about.

218
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,323
No. If this is gonna work,
we need to go all in.

219
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,242
Double what you put into Nanogenics.

220
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,035
[dramatic music playing]

221
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,415
I'll set up the pitch.

222
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:45,384
So that's your plan, huh? Gonna blackmail
me into supporting your shitty ideas?

223
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,262
I haven't decided what I'm gonna do,
but it's a good start.

224
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,556
And you should be grateful.

225
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,392
If I went to the cops, you go to jail.

226
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,562
Or I can go to HR
and hashtag-something your ass.

227
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,066
Instead, we're going deep
into residential hydropower, Cooper.

228
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,818
[sniffing]

229
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,614
You smell that? Smells like a partnership
with my name on it.

230
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,756
Well, well, you got a lot of nerve

231
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,216
showing up without even a muffin basket.

232
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,721
Cut the shit. I talked to Caroline.
You turned this whole thing around.

233
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,599
Did I? The details are a little fuzzy.

234
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,435
You knew Cooper and I were
in a fragile place,

235
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,688
and you made a move on my husband
without even checking with me.

236
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,275
You asked for my help.
You came to that party of your own accord.

237
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,488
Your husband told me to do what I did.
It tasted like he enjoyed it.

238
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,575
That was a onetime mistake.

239
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,788
Don't you ever touch my husband again.

240
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,669
I thought
you wanted something more, Billie.

241
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,588
All your talk of sex and freedom.

242
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,509
Instead, you made a very public problem
at a very private party.

243
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,721
I know, and I'm sorry,
but that's what it took for me to realize

244
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,683
I don't want what you and Devon have.

245
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,019
I don't want my husband fantasizing
about somebody else,

246
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,146
let alone acting on those fantasies.

247
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,066
So you're gonna go back
to being Little Miss Happy Homemaker?

248
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,152
No. In fact,
I probably should get back to work.

249
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,696
Right, to keep you distracted

250
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,116
from the fact that your deepest
feminine desires are utterly unfulfilled.

251
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,325
That's not true.

252
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,914
There are a lot of ways to be feminine,
a lot of different desires.

253
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,001
Fine. You can tell yourself
that'll be enough.

254
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,586
But I know it won't be.

255
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,215
Guess what. Your husband knows too.

256
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,260
Cooper and I are working things out.

257
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,304
You might be trying to,
but I'm not sure Cooper is.

258
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,974
He seemed pretty done with you to me.

259
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,518
[door slams]

260
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,688
[knocking on door]

261
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,526
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

262
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:20,039
I lied before.
I'm not into residential hydropower.

263
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,710
And let me guess.
Devon didn't get jumped in Greenwich.

264
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,794
No.

265
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,464
That was me.

266
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,886
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,638
Billie and I were trying
to spice things up.

268
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,932
And so we...

269
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,187
We let Devon and Trina take us to, um...

270
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,901
to a party, and things got out of control.

271
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,360
I...

272
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,364
I did things with Trina...

273
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,910
and Devon tried to get with Billie...

274
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,040
and I lost it.

275
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,253
I cannot imagine you doing any of this.

276
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,256
That's not the Cooper Connelly I know.

277
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,801
It's not the Cooper Connelly
that I know either.

278
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,181
Um...

279
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,020
I have to take this to HR.

280
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,483
Despite the fact that
the incident occurred outside of work,

281
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,277
it was still a physical altercation
between two employees.

282
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,361
I know.

283
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,489
I can't let my feelings get in the way.

284
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,407
I understand that, and I'm...

285
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,284
I'm so sorry.

286
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,286
No, I'm sorry for you.

287
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,290
When are you gonna leave her?

288
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,337
- Francesca...
- She's destroying you.

289
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,928
I told you how you rescued me.
Now it's my turn.

290
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,143
This is a key to my apartment.

291
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,021
It's a safe haven. Maybe a fresh start.

292
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,486
You don't ever have to go home again.

293
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,879
[dramatic music playing]

294
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,982
Mommy?

295
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,361
Hi, honey.

296
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,239
Oh, look at you!

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,116
What's a divorce?

298
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,204
Where'd you hear that word?

299
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,790
Hannah said her mom said
you and Daddy are getting a divorce.

300
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,129
That's not happening. Okay? It's...

301
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,967
It's not true. I promise.

302
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,345
[door opens, then closes]

303
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,597
Hey, hey. Aunty Sasha's back.

304
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,018
- Almost time for you guys to go, right?
- [Hudson] Daddy's not home.

305
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,647
Oh, he's coming. I'm sure he's on his way.

306
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,649
We can't make France without Daddy.

307
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,819
We're gonna be fine, honey. We've got...

308
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,866
We have passports, we have brie.
Everything's gonna be great.

309
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,579
Hey, Huddy.

310
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,335
Why don't we go check on Ellary?
What do you say? Yeah? Okay.

311
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,463
Go, go, go. I'll race you.

312
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,884
[dramatic music playing]

313
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,929
[cell phone ringing]

314
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,312
[voicemail] <i>You've reached
Cooper Connelly.</i>

315
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:17,442
<i>Sorry I'm not available to take your call.
Leave a message. I'll speak with you soon.</i>

316
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,705
- [voicemail beeps]
- Cooper, where are you?

317
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:24,116
I know you're angry,
but it's Hudson's International Fair.

318
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,701
Don't do this to him.

319
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,997
Don't do this to us.

320
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,543
Just... Just call me. Please.

321
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,094
[elevator dings]

322
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,518
Thanks for seeing me.

323
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,151
You want a drink?

324
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,906
Yeah. Sure.

325
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,452
So this is, uh...

326
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,456
your place, huh?

327
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,543
This is where you lived...

328
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,463
together.

329
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,635
- Yeah.
- Look...

330
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,390
I know there's something going on
between you.

331
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,438
She's in love with you.
Always has been, always will be.

332
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,815
- Cooper...
- Just stop.

333
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,786
I just need to know...

334
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,209
Is this real for you too?

335
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,089
Okay, if I walk away,

336
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,551
will you take care of her?

337
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,973
It's not just her. Okay? It's my kids too.

338
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,394
They'll be a part of your life,
they'll have to be.

339
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:07,028
And I will not walk away unless I know
that they're all gonna be okay.

340
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,202
It is real.

341
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,668
I am undeniably in love with your wife.

342
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,422
And I would do anything...

343
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,550
lay down my life...

344
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,679
to be the father
of her children and yours.

345
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,103
But she won't have me.

346
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,232
Oh, bullshit.

347
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,235

She's a rock star.

532
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,747
It's called code-switching.

533
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,376
Something we, in the Black community,
know all too well.

534
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,256
When you change the way you talk
based on who you're talking to.

535
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,967
Usually because the way
you have traditionally spoken

536
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,135
is considered unacceptable

537
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,428
by some other group.

538
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,765
In this case, mainstream white America.

539
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,852
You abandon your authentic self
in an attempt to fit in.

540
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,605
But you know who else code-switches?

541
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,860
Women. We fall into line.

542

which fits expectations men have dictated.

543
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,326
- We make ourselves smaller.
- [dramatic music playing]

544

Less intimidating. Less dangerous.

545
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,833
For some women,
this is what happens during marriage.

546
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,795
Many others feel this is the only way
to make themselves marriage-worthy.

547
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:23,175
Repressing who we are is
classic unhealthy behavior.

548
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,053
The rage that comes
as a result of it is real.

549
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,391
As is the desperate need for a release.

550

Assimilation.

551
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:37,440
Fitting in has always been a key strategy
for survival in America.

552
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,525
But is it really behavior...

553
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,619
Women need to honor those feelings.

554
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,830
And respect their validity.

555
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,333
The goal, of course,

556
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,545
is to return to that one true self.
