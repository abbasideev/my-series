You're gonna live happily ever after.

I saw this relationship headed.

that Brad's a flight risk.

Mm-mm. Not just a risk. He flew.

- This is different.

that came out of his mouth.

- I believe him.
- You believe him every time, Billz.

37

and then you cave,

Okay. Maybe you're not lying to me,

150

but you are definitely lying to yourself
and I'm just along for the ride.

- I don't want that at all.
- Really?

I mean, maybe Brad makes you feel a way...

that I can't make you feel.

00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,024
- You have two babies now, right?
- Yes.

182
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,902
- Let me see those pictures.
- Okay. All right.

183
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,570
Uh... [clears throat]

184
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,073
- I do have lots of them.
- Heh.

185
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,076
[tender music playing]

186
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,037
Okay, well, that's Hudson and Ellary.

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,039
[Kenya] Oh, my goodness.

188
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,292
They just don't make them
like this anymore.

189
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,212
Thank you.

190
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,131
Have a seat.

191
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,217
Sumner should be back any minute.

192
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,135
Okay, great. Yeah.

193
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,449
[indistinct chatter]

194
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,958
Okay, it is 6:30,

195
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,127
everyone is here,
and they showed up starving

196
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,421
'cause they killed
this platter of deviled eggs.

197
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,339
And, girl, I forgot to put mayo in them.

198
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,551
Plus, Sumner wants to make
some big toast to you.

199
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,345
So we waiting on Brad? Where is he?

200
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
I don't know.

201
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,642
He should be here.

202
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,853
You tried calling him?

203
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,687
He'll be here.

204
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,025
Plus, you know how long
those studio sessions can go, so...

205
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,943
Totally.

206
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,614
But did you try texting him?

207
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,825
It's not what you're thinking.

208
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,452
I'm not thinking anything.

209
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,703
Please.

210
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,041
There's not a teeny, tiny part
of you right now that's gloating,

211
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,086
- thinking that he's halfway to JFK?
- Is that what you're thinking?

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,131
He's not at JFK
because he's on his way here.

213
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,215
Okay.

214
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,761
All right. Help me serve.

215
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,179
- Yes.
- Yeah.

216
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,388
- All right.
- All right.

217
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,811
- [all laughing]
- ["Solo" playing over speakers]

218
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,230
- Congrats, Billie.
- Oh, thank you.

219
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,065
Amazing job on the article.

220
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,152
- Thank you so much, Kossi.
- Yeah, of course.

221
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,653
Where's my boy Brad at?

222
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,283
Uh, he's running late.

223
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,039
Okay, everyone... let's eat.

224
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,166
Actually, before we eat,

225
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,170
I'd just like to say a few words
about Miss Billie, Professor Mann.

226
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,505
[all laugh]

227
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,508
I always knew that Billie would eventually
hypnotize the world

228
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,804
with her brilliant, albeit archaic,
theories on monogamy.

229
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,723
Okay, all right, all right.
It is an article on the psychology

230
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,975
behind the ultimate female orgasm.

231
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,062
She is gifting women
the best sex of their lives.

232
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,332
- [Billie] Yes.
- As long as they have it with one person.

233
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,691
Sometimes, it takes more than one night

234
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,819
to make
a woman feel safe enough to let go.

235
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,155
- So it says, so it says.
- [all laughing]

236
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,910
"Now I'm in the longest relationship
of my life,

237
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,204
and that safety and commitment

238
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,123
is allowing me to have
the best sex of my life."

239
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,292
[all laughing]

240
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,253
Yeah.

241
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,587
Look, I mean,

242
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,423
it's not like I haven't tried it your way,

243
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,094
but, trust me, this way is much better.

244
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,430
I'll be sure to ask Brad all about it.

245
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,015
If he ever gets here.

246
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,727
Uh, can we get
to the drinking part of this toast?

247
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,354
Indeed. Published is published.

248
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:19,608
I'm sure this is gonna be
<i>Psychology Today's</i> best-selling issue yet.

249
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,026
To the women of the world,

250
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,154
who will no doubt be indebted
to you forever.

251
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,448
- [Sasha] Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear! Yes.

252
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,366
[Kossi] Hey!

253
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,659
You made it.

254
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,455
Excuse me. [clears throat]

255
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,292
[dramatic music playing]

256
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,544
Where have you been? Are you flipping out?

257
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,838
If you're flipping out,
then just tell me now.

258
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,549
I'm not flipping out.

259
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,429
I'm late because I was cleaning out...

260
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,768
every bodega between here and...

261
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,729
Houston.

262
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,985
Get used to me coming home.

263
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,699
I got a real family for the first time.

264
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,077
And I'm not going anywhere.

265
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,163
[pop music playing]

266
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,962
Billie Mann in the flesh.

267
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,176
And crawling back to me a good two
to five years ahead of schedule?

268
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,259
Hmm?

269
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,304
Are you okay?

270
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,683
I need to talk to you.

271
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,186
Sure. Come on in.

272
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,652
So...

273
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,113
what's going on?

274
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,197
I don't know.

275
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,077
I have a beautiful life.

276
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,665
I have a beautiful husband.

277
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,832
Or I...

278
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,711
did, but I'm, um...

279
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,172
I'm messing it all up.

280
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,175
You know I have to ask,
but do you think you're messing it all up

281
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:12,596
because you've convinced yourself
that it's more beautiful than it is?

282
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,681
No. God, no.

283
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,061
I mean, 85% of my marriage is
the stuff that people dream about.

284
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,144
It's...

285
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,607
It's just that 15%...

286
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,942
Which is?

287
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,111
- Sex.
- Ah.

288
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,656
Which I know is a dumb reason
to screw up your marriage.

289
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,658
Sex is rarely just about sex.

290
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,994
What's it about for you?

291
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,161
Desire.

292
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,500
Feeling desired.

293
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,087
But then also...

294
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,965
freedom.

295
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,136
To be anyone...

296
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,930
to do anything.

297
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,184
I just haven't felt that way since...

298
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,268
Brad.

299
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,314
There's no judgment here.

300
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,776
A few months ago, I...

301
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,862
[dramatic music playing]

302
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,949
I started writing in my journal.

303
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,787
I was fantasizing about...

304
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,670
all the... crazy chemistry
that we used to have...

305
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,257
and things...

306
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,972
just snowballed.

307
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
Billie...

308
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,936
You're beautiful.

309
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,651
That's the 15% reminding you
it's still there.

310
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,153
But I have Cooper.

311
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,699
I mean, you should see
my children and this man

312
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,077
who would give me anything.

313
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,208
Who's trying to give me everything
that I want, but somehow it's just...

314
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,003
It's not the same.

315
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,630
It can't be.

316
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,008
The person who gives you all that security

317
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,929
can't be the same person
who gives you the... thrill,

318
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,807
the risk, the excitement, the lust. It...

319
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,142
doesn't work that way.

320
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:29,108
So there's no solution that doesn't
involve me cheating on my husband?

321
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,069
Isn't that why you came to see me?

322
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,280
I came to see you because you're
the closest thing I have to a shrink.

323
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,701
But I'm also the guy who doesn't believe
in that "till death do us part" crap...

324
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,913
so maybe you came here looking for a pass.

325
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,041
And maybe that's okay.

326
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,086
But you never would, right?

327
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,338
You're the monogamist.

328
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,298
And it's 85/15, so...

329
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,260
Cooper wins.

330
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,557
Unless...

331
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,602
Unless what?

332
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,608
Unless you think there's a world
in which Brad could somehow give you both.

333
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,670
[cell phone unlocks]

334
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
[clears throat]

335
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,011
It's me.

336
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,223
I'm in the city. Where are you?

337
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,438
Now, this is a unique opportunity
that could make a real difference

338
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,732
in millions of people's lives,

339
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,984
and we're hoping
you'll see it that way too.

340
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,327
Any questions?

341
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,622
I think we're all set.

342
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,915
Thank you, Cooper.

343
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,377
This technology is revolutionary.

344
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,796
I mean, this is the future
of modern medicine.

345
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,965
Right. We got it.

346
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,928
Can we have a minute alone with Francesca?

347
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,350
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

348
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,856
[indistinct chatter]

349
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,316
So?

350
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,735
Jury's still out.

351
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,990
- What happened? I thought you'd get a yes.
- I don't know. I...

352
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,619
Uh, sidenote,
heard last night was boozy and epic.

353
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,204
Ladies and gentlemen...

354
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,624
it's a yes.

355
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,459
- [all cheering]
- Yeah! Thattaboy!

356
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,673
What the hell happened in there?

357
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,592
What, they liked the idea,

how I felt about making you partner.

Holy shit.

and, frankly, overdue.

Obviously, I have some things
that I need to work out at home.

375

- Um...
- Or not.

376

Look, I would never break up a happy home.

But since your home doesn't seem
so happy at the moment...

You're the full package, Cooper.

And I've had to learn the hard way

380
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,802

gets divorced,

I'm... flattered, really. Uh...

Billie and I are at right now.

389
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,500
I like who I am when I'm with you.
