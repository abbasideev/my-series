1
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:03,374
- 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'
- Hannibal!

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,040
We are as close
as we are ever going to get

3
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,499
to catching this man.

4
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,749
I'm dismantling who I was
and moving it brick by brick.

5
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,374
It's the last stage of a transformation.
We could disappear now.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,832
You've set some sort of trap
and you're goading Hannibal into it.

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,249
How can you be sure
he's not goading you?

8
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,415
I can't.

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,457
I have begun to question your actions
with regards to my attack.

10
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:31,124
I am no longer your therapist.
You are dangerous.

11
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,790
- Antony Dimmond.
- Boris Jakov.

12
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,249
I'd offer a hand, but...

13
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,999
It's a double-fisted kind of bash.

14
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,957
Do you know Roman well?

15
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,249
You were staring with the thinly-veiled
disdain of a man who does.

16
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,457
I was his TA at Cambridge.
He was insufferable even then.

17
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,624
Have you read his books?

18
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,874
They're terrible.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,207
You know they're terrible,
you're just too polite to say.

20
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,249
Blink if you agree.

21
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,124
See.

22
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,165
Doesn't stop him squatting
over his keyboard

23
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,874
and depositing a fresh one
every six to eight months.

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,832
It takes me six to eight months
to write one line.

25
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,332
Why?

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,665
Poetry is hard.

27
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,957
Too hard for Roman.

28
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,374
Well, it's easier for him to slide into
academia and dissect the work of others

29
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,832
than it is to stand by his own words.

30
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,874
One can appreciate another's words
without dissecting them.

31
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,999
Though, on occasion,
dissection is the only thing that will do.

32
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,124
Bonsoir.

33
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,374
Bonsoir.

34
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,499
Bonsoir.

35
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,957
Bonsoir.

36
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,957
Bonsoir.

37
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,374
You really are the Devil.

38
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,832
Certainly seem to enjoy it.
You have a click in your hoof.

39
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,499
The Devil has been a yoke
on the neck of humanity

40
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,165
since we first began
to think and dream.

41
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,249
I for a much shorter time.

42
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,999
You admit the yoke.

43
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,874
Smells of candy apples and thyme.

44
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,832
You smoked me in thyme.

45
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:46,624
Smoked. Glazed.
Served on a sugar cane quill.

46
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,957
You will be falling off the bone.

47
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,207
Well, of course.

48
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,707
And with these rarified dishes
you so carefully prepare,

49
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,040
do we all taste different?

50
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,165
Everyone has their flavour.

51
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,207
Cannibalism was standard behaviour
among our ancestors.

52
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,499
The missing link was only missing
because we ate him.

53
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,540
This isn't cannibalism, Abel.
It's only cannibalism if we're equals.

54
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,499
This is only cannibalism if you eat me.

55
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,374
But you just feel this is
the natural order of things,

56
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,290
everybody gets ate.

57
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,124
Be he fat or be he lean.

58
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,249
With my last leg standing next to me,

59
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,832
I should still wrestle with the urges
to fight or flee.

60
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,582
It's called "terminal restlessness".

61
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,290
The body fills with adrenaline
and feels compelled to go-go-go.

62
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,540
"Go-go-go"?
I've already got up and gone.

63
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,790
This is posthumous.

64
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,957
You're not dead yet, Abel.
You still have to eat.

65
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,665
No, I don't.

66
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,415
At this point, there is absolutely
nothing I have to do.

67
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,332
But I shouldn't spoil the fairy tale,
should I?

68
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,707
You and your little gingerbread house.

69
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,499
Let it be a fairy tale, then.

70
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,707
Once upon a time...

71
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,207
Bellissima.

72
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,999
Grazie.

73
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,374
Dr Fell, I hope you translate
as well as you waltz.

74
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,124
Mrs Fell.

75
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,832
Our new appointee was confirmed
by the board after close questioning.

76
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,249
You've examined him
in medieval Italian,

77
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,290
and I will not deny
his language is...

78
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,374
admirable.

79
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,540
- Thank you.
- For a straniero.

80
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,499
Are you familiar with the personalities
of pre-Renaissance Florence?

81
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,415
I think not.

82
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:42,582
Dr Fell might hold in his hand,
in his non-Italian hand,

83
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,457
a note from Dante Alighieri himself.

84
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,624
Would he recognise it?

85
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,540
I think not.

86
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,207
Professor Sogliato, would you
do me the honour of a dance?

87
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,165
Of course.

88
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,374
Allegro mi sembrava Amor
tenendo meo core in mano,

89
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,874
e ne le braccia avea madonna involta
in un drappo dormendo.

90
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:17,457
Poi la svegliava, e d'esto core ardendo
lei paventosa umilmente pascea;

91
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,624
appreso gir lo ne vedea piangendo.

92
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,499
Dante's first sonnet.

93
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,290
It fascinated Cavalcanti. The eating
of the heart is a powerful image.

94
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,915
If he's such an expert on Dante,
let him lecture on Dante...

95
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,582
to the Studiolo.

96
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,624
Let him face them.

97
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,082
- Extempore.
- I'm happy to sing for my supper.

98
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,249
Professor Sogliato.

99
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,999
We are among the palaces
built 600 years ago

100
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,582
by the merchant princes,
the kingmakers

101
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,665
and the connivers
of Renaissance Florence.

102
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,249
There's connivers of modern Florence.

103
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,707
I've found a peace here
that I would preserve.

104
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,665
I've killed hardly anybody
during our residence.

105
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,415
You created a vacancy
at the Palazzo Capponi

106
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,165
by removing the former curator.

107
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,082
A simple process requiring
a few seconds' work on the old man

108
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,665
and a modest outlay
for two bags of cement.

109
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,415
You no longer have
ethical concerns, Hannibal.

110
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,957
You have aesthetical ones.

111
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,249
Ethics become aesthetics.

112
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:52,332
You seem more interested in making
appearances than maintaining them.

113
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,957
Would you?

114
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,124
If this is about my position
at the Palazzo,

115
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,540
once the path was cleared,
I won the job fairly.

116
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,124
On my merits.

117
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,374
Yes, even the most
contentious Florentines

118
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,499
can't resist the verse of Dante
ringing off frescoed walls.

119
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,165
One contentious Florentine can.

120
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,415
Have you given serious thought
to eating Professor Sogliato?

121
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,624
My killing Sogliato now
would not preserve the peace.

122
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,540
Your peace is without morality.

123
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,249
Morality doesn't exist. Only morale.

124
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,332
How you feel today.

125
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,999
How do you feel today?

126
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,082
I still believe I'm in conscious control
of my actions.

127
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,457
Given your history, that's a good day.

128
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,165
If you think you're about
to catch Hannibal,

129
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,207
it's because he wants you
to think that.

130
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:36,040
Don't fool yourself into thinking
he's not in control of what's happening.

131
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,915
May I get dressed?

132
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,249
You may.

133
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,082
What have you done, Hannibal?

134
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,665
I've taken off my person suit.

135
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,290
You let them see you.

136
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,749
I let them see enough.

137
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,290
How does it feel?

138
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,665
Being seen?

139
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,249
Well, you're in no position to ask,
Dr Du Maurier.

140
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,957
You ended our patient-psychiatrist
relationship.

141
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,624
I lacked the appropriate skills
to continue your therapy.

142
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,332
I never found you to be lacking.

143
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,707
I'm sorry I didn't provide you
with a suitable substitute for therapy.

144
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,290
Is Will Graham still alive?

145
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,124
Will Graham was not
a suitable substitute for therapy.

146
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,040
What was he?

147
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,374
Is this professional curiosity?

148
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,540
Almost entirely.

149
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,832
Do you trust me?

150
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,665
Not entirely.

151
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,665
Are you taking into consideration
my beliefs about your intentions?

152
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,749
My intentions?

153
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,665
Human motivation can be
little more than lucid greed.

154
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,124
Greed...

155
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,249
and blind optimism.

156
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,457
You're optimistic I won't kill you.

157
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,957
Due bottiglie di Bâtard-Montrachet
e tartufi bianchi, per favore.

158
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,165
Hello!

159
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,415
Bonjour!

160
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,582
Mr Jakov, isn't it?

161
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,832
We met in Paris a few months back.

162
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,040
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,

163
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,999
it's just here I was
and then there you were.

164
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,999
- I never forget a face.
- Antony Dimmond.

165
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,665
- Nice to be remembered.
- You're hard to forget.

166
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:21,040
What are you doing in Florence?
Are you working with Roman?

167
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,582
Dr Fell?

168
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,582
I heard he took an appointment
at the Capponi Library.

169
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,832
Yes, he's the new curator and
translator at the Palazzo Capponi.

170
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:32,832
Evidently, the last one eloped with
a woman or someone's money, or both.

171
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,082
That's the commonly-held belief.

172
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,040
- You just missed Roman.
- Did I?

173
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,957
Oh, I was hoping to take the piss.

174
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,832
Spare the piss for the time being.

175
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,582
If you're free, my wife and I would
love to have you for dinner.

176
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,665
Listen.

177
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,957
They prefer eating in company.

178
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,457
I've kept cochlear gardens
since I was a young man,

179
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,207
fattening snails on herbs
and vine leaves.

180
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:47,124
Like all of us, what they eat greatly
influences and enhances their flavour.

181
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,540
When I'm not busy eating myself,

182
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,499
you wish me to be eating oysters,

183
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,790
drinking sweet wines
and snacking on acorns.

184
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,707
All to make me tastier?

185
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh, yes.

186
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,832
And you are making them tastier.

187
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:10,040
And I you.
Imagine what you must taste like.

188
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,874
Won't be long until someone's
taking a bite out of you.

189
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:19,915
You're becoming brighter, Abel.
Dying hasn't dulled you one bit.

190
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,874
The snails are certainly having
a lovely experience,

191
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,957
fattened on me
in a red-wine marinade.

192
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,624
They have no idea
they're going to be eaten.

193
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,082
We do.

194
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,290
How well do you know the Fells?

195
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,915
As well as anybody.

196
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,082
Which'd be not really.

197
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,082
Lydia a friend of yours?

198
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,915
Not really.

199
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:36,749
I'd be surprised to hear she had one.
We share a mutual detestation.

200
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,457
She disapproves of my disapproval.

201
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,207
What do you disapprove of?

202
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,957
Roman, mainly.

203
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:49,249
Lydia isn't quite bright enough
to see I'm just intimidated.

204
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:53,082
Roman does, of course.
How he loves to strike fear.

205
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,874
Dante wrote that fear is
almost as bitter as death.

206
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,249
Dante wasn't dead when he wrote it.

207
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:07,499
- Are you travelling alone, Antony?
- The only way I travel.

208
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,582
Oh...

209
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:16,249
Roman is speaking to the Studiolo Friday
on Dante. You should come.

210
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,790
Sounds appropriately hellish.

211
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,707
Are you avoiding meats?

212
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,457
I'm trying not to eat anything
with a central nervous system.

213
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,207
Oysters, acorns and Marsala.

214
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:40,999
That's what ancient Romans would feed
animals to improve their flavour.

215
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:55,332
My husband has
a very sophisticated palate.

216
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,957
He's very particular about how I taste.

217
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,957
Is it that kind of party?

218
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,249
It is not that kind of party.

219
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,082
No.

220
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,957
It really isn't.

221
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,249
Shame. You were both suddenly
so fascinating.

222
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,082
- Buonasera.
- Buonasera.

223
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,624
Buonasera.

224
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,540
You let him go.

225
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,707
What would you have me do, Bedelia?

226
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,332
Due bottiglie di Bâtard-Montrachet
e tartufi bianchi, per favore.

227
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,749
Grazie.

228
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,832
Bedelia.

229
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,207
He attacked me.

230
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,874
Is that your blood?

231
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,624
No.

232
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,665
You were defending yourself?

233
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,832
I was reckless.

234
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,082
This wasn't reckless violence.

235
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,499
It was a controlled use of force.

236
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,832
I know what happened.

237
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,665
Do you?

238
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:54,749
He was your patient
before he was mine.

239
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,124
He died under your care.

240
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,582
You were not defending yourself.

241
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,999
I can help you tell the version of events
you want to be told.

242
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,915
I can help you,

243
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,915
if you ask me to.

244
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,874
Will you help me?

245
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,832
In accord with my own taste
for the pre-Renaissance,

246
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,415
I present the case of Pietro della Vigna,

247
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:14,040
whose treachery earned him
a place in Dante's Hell.

248
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:18,332
He was disgraced and blinded
for betraying his emperor's trust.

249
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,582
Dante's pilgrim finds him
in the seventh level of the Inferno,

250
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,582
reserved for suicides.

251
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,540
Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging.

252
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:32,999
Judas and Pietro della Vigna
are linked in Dante's Inferno.

253
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,082
Betrayal and hanging,

254
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,249
then, linked since antiquity,

255
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,374
the image appearing
again and again in art.

256
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:46,165
This is the earliest-known depiction
of the Crucifixion,

257
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:50,124
carved on an ivory box in Gaul
about A.D. 400.

258
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,999
It includes the death by hanging
of Judas,

259
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,582
his face upturned to the branch
that suspends him.

260
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,665
On the doors
of the Benevento Cathedral,

261
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,124
we see Judas hanging
with his bowels falling out.

262
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:06,874
And here, from a 15th-century
edition of The Inferno

263
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,832
is Pietro della Vigna's body
hanging from a bleeding tree.

264
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:14,582
I won't belabour the parallels
with Judas Iscariot.

265
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,290
Betrayal, hanging, self-destruction.

266
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,290
"lo fei gibetto a me de le mie case."

267
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:27,290
"I make my own home be my gallows."

268
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:31,082
Mr Dimmond, welcome.
Please join us.

269
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,332
We were just about to discuss
the matter of chewing in Dante.

270
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,332
Thank you for your kind attention.

271
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,999
Thank you.

272
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,665
Would you say I secured my position,
Professor Sogliato?

273
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,082
The Studiolo seem satisfied.

274
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,082
Satisfied?

275
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,290
I thought the applause was
downright enthusiastic

276
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,832
in its soft and dusty way.

277
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,957
Dottore Fell is a friend of yours?

278
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,249
I was his TA at Cambridge.

279
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,499
The tales I could tell.

280
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,624
Please do.

281
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,082
What kind of friend would I be?

282
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,290
What kind of friend, indeed.

283
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,957
Dottore.

284
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,332
An exposition of atrocious
torture instruments

285
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:04,790
appeals to connoisseurs
of the very worst in mankind.

286
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:10,457
Now that ceaseless exposure has
calloused us to the lewd and the vulgar,

287
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:14,249
it is instructive to see
what still seems wicked to us.

288
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,457
What still slaps the clammy flab
of our submissive consciousness

289
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,624
hard enough to get our attention?

290
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,374
What wickedness has your attention,
Mr Dimmond?

291
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,499
Yours...

292
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,374
Dr Fell.

293
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:36,332
I have no delusions about morality.

294
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,624
If I did,
I would've gone to "la polizia".

295
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:44,207
I'm curious as to what fate
befell Dr Fell

296
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,915
to see you here in his stead.

297
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:54,540
You may have to strap me
to the breaking wheel to loosen my tongue.

298
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:58,207
You overestimate my affection
for the genuine Dr Fell.

299
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,790
Clearly, you found him
as distasteful as I did.

300
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,832
On the contrary.

301
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:15,415
We can twist ourselves into all manner
of uncomfortable positions

302
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,915
just to maintain appearances,
with or without a breaking wheel.

303
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:26,124
Are you here to twist me
into an uncomfortable position?

304
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,249
I'm here to help you untwist...

305
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,457
to our mutual benefit.

306
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:24,665
Observe or participate.

307
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,665
What?

308
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:37,290
Are you, in this very moment,
observing or participating?

309
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,207
Observing.

310
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,999
You say you're observing,
but this...

311
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,040
This is participation, Bedelia.

312
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,332
Did you know what he would do?

313
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,707
I would prefer you answer honestly.

314
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:04,457
- I was curious.
- You were curious what would happen.

315
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,957
You were curious
what Mr Dimmond would do.

316
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,332
What I would do.

317
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,499
Did you anticipate our thoughts?

318
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,332
Counter-thoughts?
Rationalisations?

319
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,165
Yes.

320
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,957
Is this what you expected?

321
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,790
Yes.

322
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,790
That's participation.

323
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,374
What have you gotten yourself into,
Bedelia?

324
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,124
Shall I hang up your coat?

325
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:30,040
Would you rather I extended you
the same kindness as the escargot?

326
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:34,249
Eating me without my knowledge?

327
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,082
No.

328
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:41,915
I find knowing to be far more powerful.

329
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,207
Why do you think I'm allowing this?

330
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,290
Why do you think I'm allowing this?

331
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:54,874
Cos snails aren't the only creatures
who prefer eating with company.

332
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,874
If only that company
could be Will Graham.

333
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:30,832
I'm just fascinated to know
how you will feel when all this...

334
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,415
happens to you.
