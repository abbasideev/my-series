1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:02,832
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:05,249
The novelty
of Hannibal Lecter has waned.

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:08,457
This fellow, there is something
so universal about what he does.

4
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:09,916
This freak is
in phase with the moon.

5
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:12,624
We might have a little more than
three weeks before he does it again.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,291
I don't think
about this anymore.

7
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,624
I don't think I can be
of any use to you, Jack.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,457
Is there an opinion
that you want, Will?

9
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,999
I have to see Hannibal.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,041
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court.

11
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,416
Hello, Dr Lecter.

12
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,332
Hello, Will.

13
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:54,082
- Did you get my note?
- I got it. Thank you.

14
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,332
Did you read it
before you destroyed it?

15
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,249
Or did you simply toss it
into the nearest fire?

16
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,124
I read it.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,374
And then I burned it.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,832
And you came anyway.

19
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,624
I'm glad you came.

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,332
My other callers are all professional.

21
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,916
Banal psychiatrists
and grasping second-raters.

22
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,957
Pencil-lickers.

23
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,124
I want you to help me, Dr Lecter.

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,249
Yes, I thought so.

25
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,499
Are we no longer on a first-name basis?

26
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,416
I'm more comfortable
the less personal we are.

27
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:57,666
I smell dogs and pine and oil
beneath that shaving lotion.

28
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,666
It's something a child
would select, isn't it?

29
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,582
Is there a child in your life, Will?

30
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,624
I gave you a child, if you recall.

31
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:18,041
I came about Chicago and Buffalo.

32
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,999
- You've read about it.
- I've read the papers. I can't clip them.

33
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,582
They won't let me have scissors,
of course.

34
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:29,791
You want to know
how he's choosing them.

35
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,457
I thought you would have some ideas.

36
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,791
You just came here to look at me.

37
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,624
Came to get the old scent again.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,916
Why don't you just smell yourself?

39
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,207
I expected more of you, Doctor.

40
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:59,332
That routine... is old hat.

41
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,291
Whereas you are a new man.

42
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,624
Are you a good father, Will?

43
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,082
Let me have the file.

44
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,832
An hour, and we can discuss it
like old times.

45
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,791
Thank you.

46
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,624
Family values may have declined
over the last century,

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,791
but we still help our families
when we can.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,749
You're family, Will.

49
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,582
How many people have you killed?

50
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,249
Many more than your father.

51
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,749
Are you going to kill me?

52
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,207
I'm so sorry, Abigail.

53
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,957
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you
in this life.

54
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,041
Blood rituals involve a symbolic death
and then a rebirth.

55
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,291
As with all things in the natural world,

56
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,291
you'll adapt now and mutate later.

57
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,541
Evolve or die.

58
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,457
Even if you know the state
of who you are today,

59
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,624
you can't predict
who you will be tomorrow.

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,916
You are defined up to now,
not beyond.

61
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,041
How would you have done it,
if you were going to do it?

62
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,541
How would I have murdered you?

63
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,832
I would have cut your throat
like your father did.

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,291
But you're not my father.

65
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:11,457
You accepted your father.

66
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,999
Would it be so difficult to accept me?

67
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,457
I don't know if it would be smart.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,332
We don't get wiser
as we get older, Abigail,

69
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:28,666
but we do learn to avoid or raise
a certain amount of hell,

70
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,999
depending on which we prefer.

71
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,291
I'll need to collect some flesh.

72
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,832
Not a pound. Only a piece.

73
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,082
Something you can live without.

74
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,457
You mean, like a finger?

75
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,332
I couldn't bear to take your fingers,
not even one.

76
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,832
They're so lovely.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,582
And I was hoping to teach you
how to play the harpsichord.

78
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,541
That's enough for now.

79
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:10,457
This will approximate
the amount of pressure.

80
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,582
Blood leaves the body at a gallop
and then a stumble.

81
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,791
Are you ready to die, Abigail?

82
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,582
Yes.

83
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,666
Can I push the button?

84
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,249
Yes.

85
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:11,124
Abigail Hobbs is dead.

86
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,416
Long live Abigail Hobbs.

87
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,541
It's good to see you
looking so well, Will.

88
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,624
But I can't help wishing
you weren't here.

89
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,124
Wishing and hoping.

90
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,832
How did it feel to see him again?

91
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,457
Like, erm...

92
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:08,332
...Hannibal was looking
through to the back of my skull.

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,082
Felt like a fly
flitting around back there.

94
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,416
I had the absurd feeling
that he walked out with me.

95
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:23,999
I had to stop outside the doors and
look around, make sure I was alone.

96
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,457
I know that feeling.

97
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,624
Well, at least Jack Crawford
is pleased.

98
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,624
He showed me
pictures of the families.

99
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,624
I looked at Molly and Walter
and I couldn't say no.

100
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,541
And Jack was counting on it.

101
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,957
Are you still with Margot?

102
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,666
Yes.

103
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,999
We have a baby.

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,874
A Verger baby. A son.

105
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,124
- Good for Margot.
- Good for me, I carried him.

106
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,249
He's my son. He's the Verger heir.

107
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,624
So... what are you doing here?

108
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,457
There are only five doors
between Hannibal and the outside.

109
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,707
And I have the keys to all of them.

110
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:35,332
Hannibal has never been great
with boundaries.

111
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,416
"He who sups with the Devil
needs a long spoon."

112
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,207
I'm not letting him in, Alana.

113
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,791
Don't worry about me.

114
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:58,082
I'm not just worried about you.
Last time, it didn't end with you.

115
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:20,374
This is a very shy boy, Will.
I would love to meet him.

116
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,916
I'm sure you would.

117
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,874
Have you considered the possibility
that he's disfigured?

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,999
Or that he may believe
he's disfigured?

119
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,749
That's interesting.

120
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,374
That's not interesting.

121
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,291
You thought of that before.

122
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,791
He smashed all the mirrors
in the houses,

123
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:44,457
not just enough to get
the pieces he wanted.

124
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:49,582
These shards are set so he can
see himself in Mrs Jacobi's eyes.

125
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:55,207
Could you see yourself
in their eyes, Will?

126
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,541
Killing them all?

127
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:12,874
The first small bond to the killer
itches and stings like a leech.

128
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:28,416
Like you, Will, he needs a family
to escape what's inside him.

129
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,166
You know a fair amount
about how these families died.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,124
How they lived is
how he chooses them.

131
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,124
How is he choosing them?

132
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,666
How did you choose yours?

133
00:11:55,792 --> 00:12:00,041
A ready-made wife and child
to serve your needs.

134
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,249
A stepson or daughter...

135
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,249
A stepson absolves you
of any biological blame.

136
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,999
You know better than to breed.

137
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:17,082
Can't pass on those terrible traits
you fear the most.

138
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,999
Why are there no descriptions
of the grounds?

139
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,541
I see floor plans, diagrams of the rooms
where death occurred.

140
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,874
What were the yards like?

141
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:41,874
Big, fenced, with trees. Why?

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,957
If this pilgrim feels
a special relationship with the moon,

143
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,999
he might like to go outside and
look at it, before he tidies himself up.

144
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,999
If one were nude, say,

145
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:58,332
it would be better to have outdoor
privacy for that sort of thing.

146
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,416
One must show some consideration
for the neighbours.

147
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,416
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight, Will?

148
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,416
It appears quite black.

149
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,666
You've come to wag your finger?

150
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,124
I love a good finger-wagging.

151
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,874
Yes, you do.

152
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,874
How is Margot?

153
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,249
Your cogs are turning, Hannibal.

154
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,791
I can hear them clicking.

155
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,957
Boom.

156
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,707
I don't know what you're planning
with Will Graham,

157
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,166
but you're planning something.

158
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,499
Why wouldn't you be?

159
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:47,582
You've already cracked the lid,
can't resist peeling it back.

160
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,666
Will came to me.

161
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,999
Yes, he did.

162
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,582
I advised him against it.

163
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,082
I'm sure.

164
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,874
Are you suggesting I don't have
Will's best interests in my mind?

165
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,249
I'm stating it as fact.

166
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,124
You've got Will dressed up
in moral-dignity pants.

167
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,874
Nothing is his fault.

168
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,957
I've been courteous.

169
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,457
And you've been receptive
to courtesy.

170
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:35,041
These niceties are conditional.

171
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,582
And the conditions are non-negotiable.

172
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,374
I must behave myself.

173
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,332
I know what you're afraid of.

174
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,082
It's not pain or solitude.

175
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,124
It's indignity.

176
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,874
You're a little bit like a cat that way.

177
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,791
I'll take your books,

178
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,416
I'll take your drawings,

179
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,666
I'll take your toilet.

180
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,374
You'll have nothing but indignity...

181
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,957
...and the company of the dead.

182
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,416
We have a basic affinity
for our family.

183
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,291
We can detect each other
from smell alone.

184
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,957
You recognise this?

185
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,124
My father made it. Out of bone.

186
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:16,124
Your father never wished for anything
but your happiness.

187
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,082
- My father cut my throat.
- Out of love.

188
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,124
That wasn't love.

189
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,624
Every family loves differently.
Every love is unique.

190
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:37,582
You deny your love for your father
because of what it might mean about you.

191
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,582
Can you smell him here, Abigail?

192
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,541
Yes.

193
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,916
This is what your father is.
This is all of him now.

194
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:05,416
This is what death
has reduced him to.

195
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,749
All that's left is honesty.

196
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,874
Can you be honest with me now?

197
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,916
He was as good to me
as he knew how to be.

198
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,666
Hunting with him was
the best time I ever had.

199
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,124
Yes. A fine definition of love.

200
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:42,916
You have to allow yourself to love him
the way he loved you.

201
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:12,999
What you need of your father is here,
in your head,

202
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,207
and subject to your judgment,
not his.

203
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,332
Never be ashamed
of who you are, Abigail.

204
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,291
Found it behind the Jacobis' garage.

205
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,832
Flower between its paws,
wrapped in a dish towel, strangled.

206
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,832
Son of a bitch.

207
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:30,624
Seems like you're more upset about
the cat than you were about the children.

208
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,332
I'm particularly fond of cats,
I'm not particularly fond of children.

209
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,332
- What about the Leeds' dog?
- Punctured in the abdomen.

210
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,124
The vet worked on him.
He should be OK.

211
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,957
Thought he was shot,
but they didn't find a bullet.

212
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,916
Thought he was stabbed
with an ice pick or an awl.

213
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,457
The son of a bitch.

214
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:49,207
So he feels compelled to hurt the victims'
pets before he comes to kill the family?

215
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,832
It eliminates an early-warning system.

216
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:55,916
Case the place,
kill the pet, then the family.

217
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,457
We should send a private bulletin
to veterinarians and animal shelters,

218
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,624
asking for an immediate report
of animal mutilation.

219
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,082
Chicago and Buffalo
are four states apart.

220
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,416
Nothing's been found
to link these two families.

221
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,916
What do they have in common?

222
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,582
They were both happy.

223
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,041
I sat here.

224
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,582
And I watched them.

225
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,374
Now are you just keeping America
clean or is that evidence?

226
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,291
You're trespassing, Freddie.

227
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:44,416
I was trespassing
before the blood dried.

228
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,999
- When did they call you in?
- I'm not talking to you.

229
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,791
We're co-conspirators, Will.
I died for you and your cause.

230
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,624
You didn't die enough.

231
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,666
You came into my hospital room
while I was sleeping,

232
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,832
flipped back the covers and snapped
a photo of my temporary colostomy bag.

233
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:01,457
Covered your junk with a black box.
A big black box.

234
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,124
You're welcome.

235
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,791
- You called us "murder husbands".
- You did run off to Europe together.

236
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,499
How does the Tooth Fairy compare
with Hannibal Lecter?

237
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,832
I haven't seen anything like this
since the Massacre at Muskrat Farm.

238
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,124
Funny thing about that massacre,

239
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,249
not only did Dr Bloom survive,
she got rich.

240
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,291
Lecter's living in the lap under her care.

241
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,041
What kind of arrangement
do you suppose they have?

242
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,874
A complicated arrangement.

243
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:29,291
It couldn't be more complicated
than your relationship with Hannibal.

244
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:33,082
You paid him a visit? Before you lie,
know that I know you did.

245
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,624
Goodbye, Freddie.

246
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,499
"Federal manhunters, stymied
in their search for the Tooth Fairy,

247
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,707
"have turned to the most savage killer
in captivity for help.

248
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:46,332
"'It takes one to catch one,'
a federal official told this reporter."

249
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,624
"Takes one to catch one"?

250
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,874
You're referring
to Hannibal Lecter or me?

251
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,291
I'll let my readers decide.

252
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:56,332
If you're smart, you'd use me.

253
00:25:56,458 --> 00:26:01,749
All psychopaths are narcissists.
They love to read about themselves.

254
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,416
Come on in.

255
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,624
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

256
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,541
The same Mr D who sends the rockets
when the requisitions are wrong?

257
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,749
The very one.

258
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:22,249
Put your back against
the door, come forward three steps,

259
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:26,249
until you feel the tile under your feet.
There'll be a stool on your right.

260
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,624
I'll just put this stuff in the black hole.

261
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,582
I was gonna...

262
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,832
Do you think I could have a plum?

263
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,957
Sure. They're really good.

264
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:22,082
- I need to ask a favour.
- In addition to the plum?

265
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,916
In addition to the plum.

266
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:32,874
I need some...infrared movie film.

267
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:38,749
Hot, sensitive up around...

268
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,541
...1,000 nanometres.

269
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,624
- Better off shooting digital.
- Oh, I'm not a fan of that format.

270
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,624
Nobody around here is.

271
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:56,624
I'm shooting at maybe...eight feet.

272
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:02,166
I want to photograph
the nocturnal animals at the zoo.

273
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:07,291
The more sensitive the film,
the meaner it is to handle.

274
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:10,457
You get in the coolers,
dry ice, all that.

275
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,207
- Do you plan to process it yourself?
- Uh-huh.

276
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,457
Got to be total darkness.
Can't even wear infrared goggles.

277
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,957
They'll give off radiation
and cloud the film.

278
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:24,874
I'm happy to do it for you, if you want.
Privacy guaranteed.

279
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,749
Thank you for the offer.

280
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,749
- Miss McClane.
- Mr D.

281
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,832
Can I give you a ride home?

282
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:27,291
Thank you. I take the bus all the time,
you don't need to worry about me.

283
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:29,624
I'm not worried.

284
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,791
Ride with me...

285
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,916
...for my pleasure.

286
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:23,041
Come in and I'll give you a drink.

287
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:17,541
So...how long have you been
at Gateway?

288
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,457
Three months.

289
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:24,791
I trained newly-blind people
for ten years after I finished school.

290
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,041
This's my first job on the outside.

291
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:30,707
Outside of what?

292
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,457
The inside.

293
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:36,916
I was training people to live
in the sighted world.

294
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,416
I didn't live in it myself.

295
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,999
I thought I'd get out,
knock around a little.

296
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:06,499
I wanted to go into speech therapy for
speech-and-hearing-impaired children.

297
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:10,249
I expect I'll go back to that
one of these days.

298
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,582
Do you cook?

299
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:20,457
Uh-huh.

300
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,249
How about coffee?

301
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,541
Uh-huh.

302
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:33,749
Let's talk about something for a minute
and get it out of the way.

303
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,416
You haven't said anything
since I mentioned speech therapy.

304
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:42,249
I understand you
because you speak very well

305
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,082
and because I listen.

306
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,624
People don't pay attention.

307
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,707
If you don't want to talk, OK.

308
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:52,124
But I hope that you do talk
because you can,

309
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,624
and because I'm interested
in what you have to say.

310
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,457
Huh.

311
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,124
That's good.

312
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,832
Here's what I like, Francis.

313
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:09,124
I've felt no sympathy from you.

314
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,874
I like that.

315
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,124
Sympathy feels like spit on my cheek.

316
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,541
And I don't do self-pity.

317
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,207
May I touch your face?

318
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:26,749
I just want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

319
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,749
I want to know whether
to just shut up or not.

320
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,457
Trust me.

321
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,249
I'm smiling.

322
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:07,041
- Hello, hotshot. Doing some good?
- 'Nothing you'd notice.'

323
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,999
- I'm lonesome.
- 'Me, too.'

324
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:15,249
- I'm feeling Randy.
Me, too.

325
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:20,249
- Randy's our new dog.
- Oh, hell!

326
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:23,291
Randy's got huge balls.

327
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,874
'Never mind about his balls.'

328
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,249
They almost drag on the ground.
He has to retract them when he runs.

329
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:35,999
- 'Can you retract yours?'
- Erm...

330
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,457
I retracted them once
when I was a kid.

331
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,749
Had to clear a barbed-wire fence,
carrying a stolen watermelon.

332
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,582
A criminal mind even at that age.

333
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,082
I don't have a criminal mind.

334
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,249
Of course you don't.

335
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,499
We have a new, new dog.

336
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,124
- 'Newer than Randy?'
- Belonged to one of the families.

337
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,749
There was no one left to claim her.
So I claimed her.

338
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,541
'You're a very sweet man.'

339
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:24,416
I love you and I miss you,
and you're doing the right thing.

340
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,457
'It's costing you, too, I know that.'

341
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,666
I'm here.

342
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:34,124
And I'll be here
whenever you come home.

343
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,791
- Good night, Molly.
- 'Good night, sweet man.'

344
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:49,832
As I live and breathe.
I thought I'd seen the last of you, Jack.

345
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,749
Dr Lecter.

346
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,291
You're dressing younger.

347
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,791
Have you taken up some sport
you enjoy with a new partner?

348
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,416
Tennis, maybe?

349
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:06,124
You've taken up your sport
with an old partner.

350
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,666
I wrote Will a note,
warning him you'd come calling.

351
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:14,582
Yes, I read your note
before my office forwarded it to Will.

352
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,874
To whet his appetite or yours?

353
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:25,666
You've placed him back in the pot
and you're letting him cook.

354
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,999
We're all in this stew together, Doctor.

355
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,624
It would be more honest if you ate
his brain right out of his skull.

356
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,457
And you're nothing if not honest.

357
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,499
This shy boy has already seen Will.

358
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,749
He already knows his name.

359
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:53,249
- Are you chumming the waters, Jack?
- It takes one to catch one.

360
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,582
It takes two to catch one.

361
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,707
Will has never been more effective
than he is with you inside his head.

362
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,541
I agree.

363
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,666
But don't think you can persuade me
to play along

364
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,999
with appeals to my intellectual vanity.

365
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:14,957
I don't think I'll persuade you, Doctor.
You'll either play or you won't.

366
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:30,374
Bella used to say your face was all scars,
if you knew how to look.

367
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,249
There's always room for a few more.

368
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,082
How much room does Will have, Jack?

369
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,124
Hello?

370
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,957
'They know.'

371
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,249
They're coming.

372
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,416
Are we going?

373
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,957
We're waiting for Will.

374
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:37,999
It's important that he sees you.
I want you two to be together.

375
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,249
They'll catch us if we stay.

376
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:43,291
I'm on my honour
to look after you, Abigail.

377
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,374
You have to look after me, too.

378
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:50,624
We have to protect each other
in these new lives we create.

379
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,582
I want you to go upstairs and wait.

380
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,791
For what?

381
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:03,249
Hunting with your father was
the best time you've ever had.

382
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,541
But now you're going to hunt with me.

383
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:26,582
- It's your attorney.
- Thank you.

384
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:47,999
- Hello?
- 'Hello, Dr Lecter.

385
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:52,666
'I wanted to tell you
that I am delighted

386
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:55,499
'that you have taken
an interest in me.

387
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:59,291
'I don't believe
you would tell them who I am,

388
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,082
'even if you knew.

389
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:05,707
'The important thing
is what I am becoming.

390
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:10,166
'I knew you alone would
understand this.'

391
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:14,749
Tell me, what are you becoming?

392
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:20,874
'The Great Red Dragon.'
