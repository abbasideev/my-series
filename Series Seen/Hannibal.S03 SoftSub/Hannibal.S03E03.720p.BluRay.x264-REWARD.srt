1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,707
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:05,374
My palace is vast,
even by medieval standards.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,832
The foyer is the Norman Chapel
in Palermo.

4
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,874
Severe and beautiful and timeless.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,790
You come to Palermo,
and soon a body is discovered.

6
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,165
A valentine written on a broken man.

7
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,832
There are places within himself
he can't safely go.

8
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,082
- Have you ever been a father?
- I was to my sister.

9
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,957
Her name was Mischa.

10
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,790
Hannibal!

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,707
I forgive you.

12
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,290
Was it nice to see him?

13
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,124
It was nice.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,707
Among other things.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,790
He knew where to look for me.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,624
You knew where he would look for you.

17
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,165
He said he forgave me.

18
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:23,499
Forgiveness is too great
and difficult for one person.

19
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,332
It requires two.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,874
The betrayer and the betrayed.

21
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,624
Which one are you?

22
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,915
I'm vague on those details.

23
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,374
Betrayal and forgiveness are...

24
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,207
...best seen as something
akin to falling in love.

25
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,790
You cannot control with respect
to whom you fall in love.

26
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,665
You are going to be caught.

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,332
It has already been set into motion.

28
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:20,499
Is that concern for your patient
or concern for yourself?

29
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,707
I'm not concerned about me.

30
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,999
I know exactly how I will navigate

31
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:35,457
my way out of whatever it is
I've gotten myself into.

32
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,124
Do you?

33
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,874
I did.

34
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,374
Where will Will Graham
be looking for you next?

35
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,082
Someplace I can never go.

36
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,290
Home.

37
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,415
It's not healing
to see your childhood home.

38
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,374
But it helps you measure
whether you are broken.

39
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,582
How and why,
assuming you want to know.

40
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,374
I want to know.

41
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,457
Is this where
construction began?

42
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,749
On my memory palace?

43
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,415
Its door at the centre of my mind,

44
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,207
and here you are, feeling for the latch.

45
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:04,249
The spaces in your mind
devoted to your earliest years...

46
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,665
...are they different than the other rooms?

47
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,415
Are they different than this room?

48
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,124
This room holds sound and motion,

49
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,582
great snakes wrestling and heaving
in the dark.

50
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,290
Other rooms are static scenes,
fragmentary.

51
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,374
Like painted shards of glass.

52
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,624
Everything keyed to memories,
leading to...

53
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,499
...other memories.

54
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,499
The rooms you can't bring yourself to go.

55
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,040
Nothing escapes from them
that causes you any comfort.

56
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,415
Screams fill some of those places,

57
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,790
but the corridors
do not echo screaming.

58
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,332
Because I hear music.

59
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,165
The Studiolo is a small, fierce group.

60
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,290
They've ruined a number
of academic reputations.

61
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,582
Appearing before them is a peril.

62
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,915
You were very eager to see me
discredited, Professor Sogliato.

63
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,082
You sang for your supper
before the dragons at the Studiolo.

64
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,665
And you sang very well.

65
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,707
Mm...

66
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,499
First applause,
and then by wet-eyed acclamation...

67
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,915
...the memberships affirmed you
as master of the Palazzo Capponi.

68
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,957
Punch Romaine.

69
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,999
A cocktail created by Escoffier.

70
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:50,665
Served to first-class guests on
the Titanic during their last dinner.

71
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,832
Mm...

72
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,957
The committees have a new curator.

73
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,624
They do not miss the old one.

74
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,207
If my victory pleased the professore,
I could not tell.

75
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,957
Then you weren't paying attention.

76
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,082
I pay lots of attention.

77
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,874
But not in a wide-eyed,
indiscriminate way.

78
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,957
That may have been impulsive.

79
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:44,082
Been mulling that impulse ever since
you decided to serve Punch Romaine.

80
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,165
I... I can't see.

81
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,582
Mi ricordo che il curatore...

82
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,540
Technically, you killed him.

83
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:35,165
No longer interested in preserving
the peace you found here?

84
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,457
You cannot preserve entropy.
It gradually descends into disorder.

85
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,374
Two men from the Capponi are dead.

86
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,165
I can only claim one.

87
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,624
Technically.

88
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,915
You're drawing them to you,
aren't you?

89
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,582
All of them.

90
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,249
As with his crimes in Florence,

91
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,040
Il Mostro collected anatomical trophies,

92
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,749
but left no evidence.

93
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,832
Dr Lecter is careful.

94
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,999
He will strike,

95
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:40,457
but his needs don't force him
to strike often.

96
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,082
There were long periods
when Il Mostro didn't strike at all.

97
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,165
This is the first in twenty years.

98
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,165
You have new evidence?

99
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,374
You know,

100
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,165
the window of the Questura laboratory
is garlanded with garlic

101
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,707
to keep out the evil spirits.

102
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,082
These are not people
open to new ideas.

103
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,165
My city mocks me.

104
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:13,957
My hunt for Il Mostro
has let the crows peck at my heart.

105
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,582
How is your heart?

106
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,832
Well pecked.

107
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,874
If he hasn't already,

108
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,707
Il Mostro will return to Florence.

109
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,999
Come back with me.

110
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,082
We have a chance
to regain our reputations,

111
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,832
and enjoy the honours of our trade,
by capturing the Monster.

112
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,415
I'm not here for the Monster.

113
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,374
Non è la mia casa.

114
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,832
Not my house, not my fire.

115
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,415
I'm here for Will Graham.

116
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,040
You're upsetting him.

117
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,665
You're trespassing.

118
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,707
I'm a friend of Hannibal's.

119
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,832
He sent you?

120
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,457
My name is Will Graham.

121
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,124
I'm unarmed.

122
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,124
May I lower my arms?

123
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,707
This trigger has a three-pound pull.

124
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,165
I'm holding two of it.

125
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,957
What's he saying?

126
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,332
He wants you to look at him,
speak to him,

127
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,165
but you're not going to.

128
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,832
Well, you've er...

129
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:46,415
cast aside the social graces
normally afforded to human beings.

130
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,124
He's cast them aside.

131
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,832
All he's allowed is the sound of water.

132
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,499
It's what the unborn hear.

133
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,082
It's their last memory of peace.

134
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,749
You're keeping him like an animal.

135
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,832
I wouldn't do this to an animal.

136
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,207
What did he do?

137
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,457
He ate her.

138
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,374
Mischa?

139
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,832
How long has he been your prisoner?

140
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:56,207
We've been each other's prisoner...
for a very long time.

141
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,249
However did you find yourself
in this situation?

142
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,665
That question applies to both of us.

143
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,999
And the answer's probably the same.

144
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,999
What's your name?

145
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,665
Chiyoh.

146
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,665
How do you know Hannibal?

147
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,124
One could argue, intimately.

148
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,665
Nakama?

149
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:39,124
It's the Japanese word
for a very close friends.

150
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,165
Yes, we were nakama.

151
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,874
Last time I saw him,
he left me with a smile.

152
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:14,374
All sorrows can be borne
if you put them in a story.

153
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,790
Tell me a story.

154
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:30,332
In Roman times,
each carcass was divided.

155
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,582
Prime cuts went to nobility,

156
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,499
second to the clergy,

157
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,915
third to the bourgeoisie
and fourth to the army.

158
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,332
The quinto quarto, the offal,
went to the poor.

159
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,457
The fifth quarter?

160
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,499
The innards of a carcass constitute
roughly a quarter of its weight.

161
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:52,707
"Il quinto quarto" evolved from necessity
to become high tradition.

162
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,624
Sibilo caratteristico.

163
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,207
When the lungs whistle,
the dish is done.

164
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,624
Coratella con carciofi.

165
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,915
Purple artichokes served with
spring lamb's liver, lungs and heart.

166
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,499
Professor Sogliato doesn't know
what he's missing.

167
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,374
So rude of him
to ignore your invitation.

168
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,957
He sends his regrets.

169
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:28,290
Oh, Madonna, it smells divine.

170
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,915
It is. I say that without ego.

171
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,290
I don't require
conventional reinforcement.

172
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,457
You would agree, Signora Fell?

173
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:42,332
My husband's ego is not measured
by conventional means.

174
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:46,999
I first prepared this dish in honour
of my sister when I was very young.

175
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm sure you've perfected the recipe
over the years.

176
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,499
The meat...

177
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,999
- You have a very good butcher.
- I do indeed.

178
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:24,540
The lamb must be newly slaughtered,
the organs cooked the same day.

179
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:27,165
I always oversee this process personally.

180
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:38,665
We construct fairy tales,
and we accept them.

181
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,999
Our minds concoct
all sorts of fantasies

182
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,290
when we don't want
to believe something.

183
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,249
I accept what Hannibal has done.

184
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,457
I understand why he's done it.

185
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,665
Mischa doesn't explain Hannibal.

186
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,874
She doesn't quantify what he does.

187
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,207
He does what was done to her.

188
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,582
How do you know it was your prisoner
who killed Mischa?

189
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,957
Hannibal told me so.

190
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,832
Hannibal took someone from you.

191
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,707
Are you here
to take someone from him?

192
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,165
If I were like Hannibal...

193
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,915
...I would've killed you already.

194
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,665
Cooked you, ate you...

195
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,832
...and fed what was left of you to him.

196
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,582
That's what he would do.

197
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,582
You've given that some thought.

198
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,874
Do you know where he is?

199
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:10,082
Why are you looking for him

200
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,582
after he left you with a smile?

201
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:24,790
I've never known myself as well

202
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:29,957
as I know myself...
when I'm with him.

203
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,790
You won't find Hannibal here.

204
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:43,999
There are places on these grounds
he cannot safely go.

205
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,457
Bad memories.

206
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,457
What do these grounds hold for you?

207
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:56,499
Hannibal wanted to kill that man
for what he did to Mischa.

208
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:59,832
I wouldn't let him take his life,

209
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,374
so Hannibal left his life with me.

210
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,332
He was...

211
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,207
...curious if you would kill.

212
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,832
I imagine he still is.

213
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,540
What were you like as a young man?

214
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,332
I was rooting for Mephistopheles
and contemptuous of Faust.

215
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:08,290
Would you like to talk
about your first spring lamb?

216
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,790
Would you?

217
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,415
Why can't you go home, Hannibal?

218
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,165
What happened to you there?

219
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,165
Nothing happened to me.

220
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,582
I happened.

221
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,124
How did your sister taste?

222
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,874
Go!

223
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,790
Are you a believer,
Signor Crawford?

224
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,540
Aren't we all?

225
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,374
Belief comes with imagination.

226
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,457
We also imagine the possibility
that we all live on after death.

227
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,582
Will Graham died.

228
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,332
Lui era morto.

229
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,040
lo ero morto.

230
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,082
He was dead. I was dead.

231
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,040
We didn't imagine that.

232
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,457
What does Will Graham imagine now?

233
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,040
I borrowed his imagination.

234
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,957
And I broke it.

235
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,790
But I don't know how he managed
to piece it back together again.

236
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:29,374
People come here
to be closer to their god.

237
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,249
Isn't that
what Will Graham was doing?

238
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,582
Maybe.

239
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,415
Will Graham understands Hannibal.

240
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,124
He accepts him.

241
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,540
Now, who among us doesn't want
understanding and acceptance?

242
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,915
I'm sorry.

243
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,540
You did this.

244
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,957
You set him free.

245
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,415
It was you I wanted to set free.

246
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:19,707
You said Hannibal was curious
if I would kill.

247
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,082
You were curious, too.

248
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,374
- I didn't want this.
- Yes, you did.

249
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,665
You were doing what he does.

250
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,540
He'd be proud of you, his nakama.

251
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,915
Did you know?

252
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,832
At some level... you knew.

253
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,249
He created a story...

254
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,165
...out of events
that only he experienced.

255
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:25,332
"All sorrows can be borne
if you put them in a story."

256
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:49,249
For Mischa.

257
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,540
I'll help you find him.

258
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,165
Why would you help me?

259
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,540
I have no reason to stay here.

260
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,874
Not anymore.

261
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,332
You saw to that.

262
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,374
What your sister made you feel

263
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,915
was beyond your conscious ability
to control or predict.

264
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,874
Or negotiate.

265
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:14,540
I would suggest what Will Graham
makes you feel is not dissimilar.

266
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,499
A force of mind and circumstance.

267
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,165
Love.

268
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,790
He pays you a visit or he doesn't.

269
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,374
Same with forgiveness.

270
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,290
And I would argue,
the same with betrayal.

271
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:41,165
The god Betrayal who presupposes
the god Forgiveness.

272
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,915
We can all betray.

273
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,540
Sometimes we have no other choice.

274
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,207
Mischa didn't betray me.

275
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:00,707
She influenced me to betray myself,
but I forgave her that influence.

276
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:11,082
If past behaviour is an indicator
of future behaviour,

277
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,249
there is only one way
you will forgive Will Graham.

278
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,624
I have to eat him.
