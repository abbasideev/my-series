1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,415
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,541 --> 00:00:05,124
Dr Hannibal Lecter requests
my company for dinner.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,874
This will be our last supper.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Hannibal thinks you're his man
in the room. I think you're mine.

5
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,040
They've issued a warrant
for your arrest, Will.

6
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,290
- Hello?
- They know.

7
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,499
Hello, Jack. You're early.

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,207
'Each of us

9
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,790
'whose life intersected
Hannibal Lecter lost something.

10
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,374
'A limb here, a lung there.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,374
'A few feet of intestines.'

12
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,207
The dead...

13
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,040
The dead...
at least have the luxury

14
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,457
of being done with what they lost.

15
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,082
You and I, we still itch.

16
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,874
That little itch must be
telling you something.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,499
Would you like to discuss
what that little itch is telling you?

18
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,874
Are you wearing makeup?

19
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,624
How long does it take you
to put your face on in the morning?

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,665
Now that I've got the routine down,
no time at all.

21
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:40,290
I'll tell you what. You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

22
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,707
There.

23
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,249
Now we can talk face-to-face.

24
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:33,165
I understand you have offered
quite a substantial reward

25
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,790
for any kind of relevant information
on Hannibal Lecter,

26
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,124
not just the usual
apprehension and conviction.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,290
Yes, a million dollars.

28
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,624
One million.
We advertised worldwide.

29
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,665
A high price for a fancy pig.

30
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,207
Hannibal would be a prize pig
if I had him in my hospital,

31
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,665
but you do not intend to see him
institutionalised, do you?

32
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,082
I'm saying nothing
that would force you

33
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,290
to break the bonds
of doctor-patient confidentiality.

34
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,665
You don't want a therapist,
you want a profiler.

35
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:09,832
I want to understand Hannibal Lecter,
to better understand myself.

36
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,499
You survived him. That is chief
amongst what you need to understand.

37
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,790
"Survived him"?

38
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:19,040
That implies fortune or skill on my part
that somehow allowed me to live.

39
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,207
This is exactly
how he intended me to live.

40
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,874
I know somewhere Dr Lecter
is going to and fro in the earth

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,624
and walking up and down in it,

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,290
and very likely having
a good, fun time.

43
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:43,874
How do you relieve the agony
of waiting for Dr Lecter's capture?

44
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,249
What do you fantasise about?

45
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:54,915
I wonder what would happen
if Hannibal Lecter was in your hands.

46
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,999
I worry we're heading into territory
not secured by your fee.

47
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,499
I think I need to look elsewhere

48
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,999
for someone to tend
to my emotional well-being.

49
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,749
Goodbye, Dr Chilton.

50
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,915
Happy hunting.

51
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,749
You were supposed to leave.

52
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,124
We couldn't leave
without you.

53
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,749
How do you feel?

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,749
Thirsty.

55
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,415
Feel well enough for a visitor?

56
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,082
Hello, Frederick.

57
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,915
You were expecting someone else?

58
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,332
I was hoping for someone else.

59
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,749
He knew exactly how to cut you.

60
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,832
They said it was surgical.

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,415
He wanted you to live.

62
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,999
He left us to die.

63
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,124
But we didn't.

64
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,207
Couple of suckers we've been.

65
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,540
He set us up and knocked us down.

66
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,290
What bothers me the most is,

67
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,332
I think it was easy for him.

68
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,040
Shooting monkeys in a barrel.

69
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:48,082
You had encephalitis.
I do not know what my excuse was.

70
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,374
Compulsive imitation.

71
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,874
How dull.

72
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,290
But maybe.

73
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,124
I am learning all sorts of new things
about myself these days.

74
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,165
I'm learning new things about you, too.

75
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,457
Imitation allows us to better understand
the behaviour of others.

76
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,249
I have great empathy for you, Will.

77
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,957
Both of us eviscerated and accused.

78
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,624
I have literally felt your pain.

79
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,082
We have matching scars.

80
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:28,832
You need a friend, friend.

81
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,749
You will leave this hospital
under a cloud of suspicion.

82
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,790
Not a cloud, a fog.

83
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,165
I can help you get Hannibal Lecter
out of your head.

84
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,790
And into your hospital.

85
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,374
There's opportunity here.

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,665
For both of us.

87
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,332
We can catch the man
who framed and maimed us.

88
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,207
There's no opportunity here,
Frederick.

89
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,540
Not for you.

90
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,040
The optimist believes we live
in the best of all possible worlds.

91
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,540
The pessimist fears this is true.

92
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,915
This is your best possible world, Will.

93
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,249
Not getting a better one.

94
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,832
I had hoped
you would come look for me.

95
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,540
But I understand why you didn't.

96
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,790
What can I do for you, Jack?

97
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,249
Well, I'm here to, er...

98
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:54,207
...make sure that you don't
contradict the official narrative.

99
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,582
Uh-huh.

100
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,374
Well, we're officers of the FBI,

101
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,499
wounded in the course of heroic duty.

102
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,040
That's not true for either of us.

103
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,874
Well, we were supposed to go together.
That's... That's on me.

104
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,082
My foul. My bad.

105
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,665
Not all of our choices
are consciously calculated.

106
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,790
No.

107
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,499
But our decisions are.

108
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,374
You remember when you decided
to call Hannibal?

109
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,832
I wasn't decided when I called him.

110
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,540
I just called him.

111
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,749
I deliberated while the phone rang.

112
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,040
I decided when I heard his voice.

113
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,124
You told him we knew.

114
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,207
I told him to leave.

115
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,540
I wanted him to run.

116
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,540
Why?

117
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,874
Because...

118
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,540
Because he... he was my friend.

119
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,832
And because I wanted
to run away with him.

120
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:37,082
What I said before,
I will say again,

121
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,290
which is something you cannot say.

122
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,374
That I did not warn you.

123
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,165
Cannot see what you will not see.

124
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,415
Until it shoves you out a window.

125
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,540
I've always enjoyed
the word "defenestration".

126
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,457
Now I get to use it
in casual conversation.

127
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,290
How many bones did you break?

128
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,624
You say that like I broke them.

129
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,874
You got yourself to the window,
Dr Bloom, if not through it.

130
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,290
They told me a lot of marrow
got into my blood.

131
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,999
And that I should expect
to find myself thinking differently.

132
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,290
Hallelujah!

133
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,082
I do not mean to kick you
when you are down.

134
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,207
I'm just reminding you
how you got down.

135
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,082
And who I'm down with.

136
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,082
We could all use a little group therapy
while we're down here.

137
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,707
There's only one "we"
you're really interested in, Frederick.

138
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,540
And that "we" isn't really
interested in you.

139
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,999
Will Graham could use
a breakthrough.

140
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,124
Being broken was his breakthrough.

141
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,415
Being broken was yours.

142
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,957
Will has not had his breakthrough yet.

143
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,499
He is saving that for Dr Lecter.

144
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,457
Would be the best thing
for his therapy, really.

145
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,874
It's only a matter of time before
they are back in each other's orbit.

146
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:28,207
Shame not to have the good seats.
If only to support poor Will.

147
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,540
That would require some manipulation.

148
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,249
Some English on the ball, as it were.

149
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,540
'You were so afraid of me
the last time I saw you.

150
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,874
'Before that last time I saw you.'

151
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,124
What are you doing here?

152
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,540
I guess I'm looking for you.

153
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,790
That's a good guess.

154
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,332
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting old friends.

155
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,040
You're not tempted to forget?

156
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,374
I don't want to forget.

157
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,957
I'm building rooms in my memory palace
for all my friends.

158
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,624
Friendship with Hannibal is blackmail
elevated to the level of love.

159
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,874
A mutually-unspoken pact
to ignore the worst in one another

160
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,124
in order to continue enjoying the best.

161
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,749
After everything he's done,

162
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,540
can you still ignore the worst in him?

163
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,790
I came here to be alone, Alana.

164
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,415
If you wouldn't mind.

165
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,165
I'm Dr Bloom.

166
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,207
You're the new psychiatrist.

167
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,665
I went one exit too far
on the expressway,

168
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,540
came back along the service road.

169
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,915
I'm not sure if this is my entrance.

170
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,749
This can be your entrance.

171
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,207
It isn't easy to find,
the first time you come.

172
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,999
I'm Margot Verger.

173
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,290
A witchy beauty about this place.

174
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,665
Yes, isn't there?

175
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,874
You should see it in the spring.

176
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,999
Riot of lilacs in the wind
smells nothing at all

177
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,957
like the stockyards and slaughterhouses

178
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,040
one usually associates
with the Verger name.

179
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,582
Can you please
let your brother know I'm here?

180
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,415
He knows.

181
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,332
Some people have trouble
talking with Mason.

182
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,374
So, if it bothers you,
or you can't take it,

183
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,665
I'd be happy to answer
any questions that you have.

184
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,082
Thank you.

185
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,374
Margot, you can leave us now!

186
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,457
If my brother offers you chocolate,

187
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,624
politely refuse.

188
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,540
Ah, good afternoon, Dr Bloom.

189
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,415
Good afternoon, Mr Verger.

190
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,249
You know,
I thank God for what happened.

191
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,290
It was my salvation.

192
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,082
Have you accepted Jesus, Dr Bloom?
Do you have faith?

193
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,999
I was raised in a religious atmosphere,
Mr Verger,

194
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,999
but whatever that left me with,
it's not religion.

195
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:22,415
Left me with more.
You see, I'm free, Dr Bloom.

196
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,624
I'm right with the Risen Jesus
and it's all OK now.

197
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,540
And nobody beats the Riz.

198
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,832
He will rise me up
and smite mine enemies

199
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,040
and I shall hear the lamentations
of their women.

200
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,415
That was once you, I'm told.

201
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,749
Dr Lecter got deeper inside you
than he did any of us.

202
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,165
Do you want me to get the nurse?

203
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,540
No, no, I'm... I'm fine now.

204
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,832
It's all OK now.

205
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,749
You're supposed to share any relevant
information you find on Hannibal Lecter

206
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,915
with the FBI.

207
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,582
Have you always done that?

208
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,082
Not exactly.

209
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:26,249
I want you to understand, Dr Bloom,
that this is not a revenge thing.

210
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,374
I have forgiven Dr Lecter

211
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,165
as our Saviour forgave
the Roman soldiers.

212
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,999
Forgiveness isn't all
it's cracked up to be, Mr Verger.

213
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,999
I don't need religion to appreciate
the idea of Old Testament revenge.

214
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,165
'Jack?

215
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,499
'Are you there?'

216
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,499
Did I die?

217
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,582
You did a lot of things.

218
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,540
Dying may have been among them.

219
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,665
For once, I'm glad you're stubborn.

220
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,790
What's good for the goose...

221
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,040
You're not going into the ground
with me, Jack.

222
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,290
So stop trying.

223
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,332
I was dead.

224
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,665
I knew I was dead.

225
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,582
All that was left for me to do was die.

226
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,665
I thought if I could hear your voice,
we both wouldn't have to die alone.

227
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,499
I'm not afraid of dying.

228
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:53,165
I'm not afraid of what it will be like
to be dead.

229
00:24:55,583 --> 00:25:00,415
I'm more curious...

230
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:07,457
...of any what-ifs
than I am of any absolutes.

231
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:14,124
You can do something that I can't.

232
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,957
You can cut out...

233
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,124
...what's killing you.

234
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,040
Every useful hoop
our mind can jump through

235
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,749
begins with a certain degree
of attention.

236
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:38,290
Focus is the most important thing
any of us can do.

237
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,957
You...

238
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,374
You are losing focus, Jack.

239
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,749
I have refocused.

240
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,749
Forced retirement at the FBI?

241
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:54,040
You fall in love with the Bureau,
but it does not fall in love with you.

242
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,415
Behavioural Sciences
doesn't have the resources.

243
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,999
Homeland Security is the priority now.

244
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,332
Terrorists are more frightening
than psychopaths.

245
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,790
Not to me.

246
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,374
Really?

247
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,999
The first thing you did
after getting shot in the face

248
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,582
was copyright "Hannibal the Cannibal."

249
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,790
A catchphrase is a trademark
and protected as a form of property.

250
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:21,249
You are alive because you did not
pull that glass from your neck.

251
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:26,082
Will Graham is alive because
Hannibal Lecter likes him that way.

252
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,290
Maybe it's one of those friendships
that ends after the disembowelling.

253
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:33,207
I would argue, with these two,
that's tantamount to flirtation.

254
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,832
Will is going to lead you right to him.

255
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,457
Oh, no, he's not, not to me.

256
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,499
I've let them both go.
I've let it all go.

257
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,457
You dangle Will Graham
and now you cut bait?

258
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,749
You're letting Hannibal have him
hook, line and sinker.

259
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,374
You'll excuse me, Dr Chilton,

260
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,207
I like to be home in the evenings
when my wife wakes.

261
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,457
Jack?

262
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,124
God, I love you in white.

263
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,374
Jack?

264
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,040
She'll look beautiful.

265
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,374
Bella's dead.

266
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,082
That should change
the view from these windows.

267
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,957
It's not right
if the view stays the same.

268
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,499
It's not right.

269
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,207
'I'm so sorry about Bella, Jack.'

270
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,457
I opened my eyes this morning,

271
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,540
and, at that moment,
before the weight of the day came for me,

272
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,332
I didn't even think about Bella dying.

273
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,832
I still think she was hoping to die
while I was out of the room.

274
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:44,290
But... I was there
when her heart stopped.

275
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,540
And I held onto her
until her brain died.

276
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,915
I hope she's somewhere today, Jack.

277
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,999
And that she's comfortable.

278
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,082
I hope she can see in my heart.

279
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,582
She had to die on me.

280
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,207
I knew it was coming.

281
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,165
But it still smarts.

282
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,332
I know what's coming for you, Will.

283
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,040
You don't have to die on me, too.

284
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,124
Ow.

285
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:11,665
- I'm saying "ow".
- Blood is flowing.

286
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,040
Nerves are intact.

287
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,999
Pain is a good thing.

288
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:22,540
This is why you can never legally
work in the health industry, Cordell.

289
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:25,124
They were going to throw you away.

290
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,207
You would've been wasted.

291
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,957
Scar tissue is an awesome
demonstration of self-preservation.

292
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:41,165
The flesh's fight to exist,
down to the most basic cell,

293
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,457
is a wonder.

294
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,165
At Communions around the earth,

295
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:50,957
the devout believe that,
through the miracle of transubstantiation,

296
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,915
they eat the flesh and blood of Christ.

297
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,290
It is an impressive ceremony.

298
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,249
I need to prepare an even more
impressive ceremony

299
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,999
with no transubstantiation necessary.

300
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,207
Cordell, I have known you
to be absolutely reliable

301
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,749
and capable of almost anything.
Is that true?

302
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,457
It is not untrue.

303
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:24,707
I pay you a large salary to be responsible
for my care and feeding.

304
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,290
- And all that that entails.
- All that that entails.

305
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:36,790
I would like you to begin arrangements
for Dr Hannibal Lecter to be eaten alive.

306
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:43,207
Do you have a preference
for how you would like him prepared?

307
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,749
Oh, Cordell...

308
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,749
If I had lips, I would smile.

309
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,540
Good as new.

310
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,790
All this time he eludes us,
got away clean.

311
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,665
It's as though Hannibal Lecter
has dropped off the earth.

312
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,040
Hannibal obviously has
good papers and money.

313
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:01,415
Europe is where a man of his tastes
would settle.

314
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,790
His tastes are very specific.

315
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,999
And that's how you'll find him.

316
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,874
Oh?

317
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,915
The wine.

318
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,332
The truffles.

319
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:19,874
Taste in all things will be a constant
between Dr Lecter's lives.

320
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,749
His name will change,
but his taste will not.

321
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,124
Of course,
you know what he would favour.

322
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:32,665
Tell me, Dr Bloom,
does he favour you?

323
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,707
I think I amused him.

324
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:41,665
Things either amuse him or they don't,
and if they don't...

325
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,332
Well, you didn't.

326
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,040
Do you feel he ever
genuinely cared for you?

327
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:56,582
I have no idea how Dr Lecter
genuinely feels about me.

328
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,290
Last time we spoke,
he promised he'd kill me.

329
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:08,374
Tell me, how does it feel to use
understanding as a predator's tool?

330
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,665
I'm using it as I've always used it.

331
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,374
A psychiatric tool.

332
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,540
Why not take this to Jack Crawford?

333
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,374
Jack's done at the FBI.

334
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,374
A footnote in his own
Evil Minds Museum.

335
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,957
I'm curious, Dr Bloom,
how I have found you in my pocket.

336
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,790
Do tell.

337
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:40,790
I'm all ears.
They've just been redistributed.

338
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,832
You're preparing the theatre
of Hannibal's death.

339
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,540
I'm just doing my part
to get him to the stage.

340
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,249
Where's Will?

341
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,040
He's already gone, Jack.

342
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,832
Will knows what he has to do.

343
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,999
Do you?
