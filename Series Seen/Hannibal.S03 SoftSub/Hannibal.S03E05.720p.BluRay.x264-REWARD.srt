1
00:00:01,208 --> 00:00:02,915
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,249
If this is about
my position at the palazzo,

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:08,749
once the path was cleared,
I won the job fairly on my merits.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,957
Two men from
the Capponi are dead.

5
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,415
You are going to be caught.

6
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,665
Europe is where
a man of his tastes would settle.

7
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,082
- His tastes are very specific.
- That's how you'll find him.

8
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:22,249
Come back with me. We have
a chance to regain our reputations

9
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,082
by capturing the monster.

10
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,207
I'm here for Will Graham.

11
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,415
I have no reason to stay here.
You saw to that.

12
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,457
I'll help you find him.

13
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:39,957
On still evenings,
when the air was damp after a rain,

14
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,499
we played a game.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,290
Hannibal would burn
all kinds of barks and incense

16
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,290
for me to identify by scent alone.

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,832
He was charming...

18
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,290
...the way a cub is charming.

19
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:15,957
A small cub that grows up
to be like one of the big cats.

20
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,665
One you can't play with later.

21
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:34,290
The day I met Hannibal,
he was an orphan.

22
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:39,874
I was meant to meet him
with his sister,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,999
but he was alone.

24
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,999
How did you meet him?

25
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,999
I was his aunt's attendant.

26
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,790
My parents sent me
to learn from Lady Murasaki

27
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,040
when I was just a girl.

28
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,332
I learned from Hannibal, too.

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,249
He comes in the guise of a mentor,

30
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,415
but it's distress that excites him.

31
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,457
I'm not in distress.

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,624
Not anymore.

33
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,582
You had a strict rule about taking life.

34
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,040
And you broke it.

35
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,790
Is it on your mind?

36
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:38,040
Do you see yourself killing him
over and over?

37
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,582
No.

38
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,707
I see you.

39
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,707
How do you know
Hannibal's in Florence?

40
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,290
Botticelli.

41
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,249
I've never been to Italy.

42
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,790
I've never expected to.

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,124
Birds eat thousands of snails every day.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,915
Some of those snails survive digestion.

45
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,665
And they emerge to find
they've travelled the world.

46
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,207
In the belly of the beast.

47
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,624
I kept cochlear gardens
as a young man to attract fireflies.

48
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,207
Their larvae would devour many times
their own body weight in snails.

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,915
Fuel.

50
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:36,415
To power a transformation
into a delicate creature of such beauty.

51
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,374
To the misfortune of the snail.

52
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,749
Snails follow their nature
as surely as those that eat them.

53
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,332
Fireflies live very brief lives.

54
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,040
Better to live true to yourself
for an instant than never know it.

55
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,915
Not like Will Graham does.

56
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,374
An insect lacks morality
to agonise over.

57
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,207
Will agonises about inevitable change.

58
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,124
Almost anything can be trained
to resist its instinct.

59
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,332
A shepherd dog
doesn't savage the sheep.

60
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,207
But it wants to.

61
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,874
Will has reached
a state of moral dumbfounding.

62
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,957
Empathy and reciprocity.

63
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,540
Reciprocity.

64
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:55,582
If we keep track of incoming
and outgoing intentions,

65
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,040
Will Graham is en route to kill you

66
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,749
while you lie in wait to kill him.

67
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,290
Now that's reciprocity.

68
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,207
Ciao, Bella.

69
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,790
Grazie.

70
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,165
Here we are.

71
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,665
- Grazie.
- Prego.

72
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,749
You've recently stopped wearing
your wedding ring.

73
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,582
Yes, and you've recently started
wearing yours.

74
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,957
I have a young and lovely wife.

75
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,374
Her efforts have ground
twelve pounds off my frame.

76
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,457
- La Vita Nuova.
- Yeah.

77
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,790
Divorced?

78
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,707
No, widowed.

79
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,624
Erm... I met her here.

80
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,582
It's a little strange
to be in Italy without her.

81
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,749
- What was her name?
- Bella.

82
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,832
To Bella.

83
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,124
- To Bella.
- To Bella.

84
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:24,040
I look at her and I think about
all the things I want to give her.

85
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,749
How you wish to appear in her eyes.

86
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,082
Certainly not in my present role
at the Questura.

87
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:35,540
I perform menial errands found for me
by my former subordinates.

88
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,832
Interviews in missing persons cases.

89
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,707
They've enjoyed my fall from grace.

90
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,124
You weren't in Palermo
on official business.

91
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,207
Neither were you.

92
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,082
And your subordinates
at the Questura,

93
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,332
they know you're investigating
Hannibal Lecter?

94
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,415
I'll tell them when I know it's Lecter
that I'm investigating.

95
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,165
You already know.

96
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,999
I need to be certain.

97
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,582
I am disgraced and out of fortune.

98
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:16,249
It has inclined you towards a game
that's outside of the law.

99
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,957
I know.
I played that game and I lost.

100
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,832
- Yeah.
- Let's eat.

101
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,332
Oh, my goodness!

102
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,207
How beautiful.

103
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,499
Pasta?

104
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,290
This is pappardelle alla lepre.
Can you say it?

105
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,040
- Papadelle...
- No, no. It's not "pa-pa-delle".

106
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,290
- No?
- No, it's "papardelle".

107
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,165
- Papardelle.
- Yeah! That's it, yes. With lepre.

108
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,999
Ah, thank you.

109
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:52,457
A table setting from the home
of Dr Hannibal Lecter.

110
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:00,499
The silverware is 19th-century Dutch
from Christofle.

111
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,707
The plate is Glen French china
from Tiffany.

112
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,040
The table linen is damask cotton.

113
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,374
Also from Christofle.

114
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,999
You've got to hand it to the man,

115
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,040
he has the most marvellous taste.

116
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,540
I've discovered a pattern of purchases.

117
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,999
An echo of the life
he lived in Baltimore.

118
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:31,457
He likes music, he likes wine,
he likes food and he likes you.

119
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,457
How do you taste, Dr Bloom?

120
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,540
Sweet, I bet.

121
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,499
I'm sure you got a taste of him, too.

122
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,207
Spitters are quitters,
and you don't strike me as a quitter.

123
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,707
The first step
in the development of taste

124
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,790
is to be willing to credit
your own opinion.

125
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,832
But in the areas of food and wine,

126
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,374
I have to follow Hannibal's precedents.

127
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:20,165
A receipt from a Florentine fine grocer,
Vera Dal 1926,

128
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,665
for two bottles of Bâtard-Montrachet

129
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,082
and some tartufi bianchi.

130
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,499
And another, and another,
and another.

131
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,707
Once a week,
for the last three months,

132
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,415
a blonde woman has been making
the exact same purchase.

133
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:50,374
Due bottiglie di Bâtard-Montrachet
e tartufi bianchi, per favore.

134
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,415
'And she always pays cash.'

135
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,665
Grazie.

136
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,165
She's shopping for Hannibal.

137
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,665
Bravo.

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,582
Are we obligated to talk?

139
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,790
No.

140
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,999
Strange to talk so much.

141
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:07,165
Not used to hearing voices
outside my head.

142
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,415
I hear voices from all directions.

143
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,624
In the gnawing sameness
of your days...

144
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,624
...did you look at the shape of things?

145
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,582
At... what you were becoming?

146
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,999
I wasn't becoming anything.

147
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,999
I was... standing still.

148
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,499
Exactly where he left me standing.

149
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,749
Like taxidermy.

150
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:53,332
Hollowed out and filled
with something else.

151
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,832
Not something else.

152
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,124
I'm not as malleable as you are.

153
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,249
I was violent when it was
the right thing to do.

154
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,499
But I think you like it.

155
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:16,957
Hannibal and I afforded
each other an experience

156
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,624
we may not otherwise have had.

157
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,082
If you don't kill him...

158
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,957
...you're afraid
you are going to become him.

159
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,040
Yes.

160
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:38,707
There are means of influence
other than violence.

161
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,582
Dr Fell?

162
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,290
Yes.

163
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,499
I am Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
from the Questura di Firenze.

164
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,957
I was wondering if you ever met
your predecessor?

165
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,374
Never met him.

166
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,165
Read several of his monographs.

167
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,832
The officers who first investigated
checked the Palazzo for any sort of note.

168
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,874
Farewell note, suicide note...

169
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,499
Found nothing.

170
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,124
The going assumption is,
he eloped with a woman.

171
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,915
And her money.

172
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,249
What is the going assumption
regarding Professor Sogliato?

173
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,165
Still no word?

174
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,165
You may have had the last word
with Sogliato.

175
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,624
Your colleague...

176
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,124
...Signor Albizzi, tells me no one
has spoken to Professor Sogliato

177
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,374
since he declined
your invitation to dinner.

178
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,332
He's the second to have
disappeared from the Palazzo.

179
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,082
Like any good investigator,

180
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,624
I'm sure you're sifting
the circumstances for profit.

181
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,874
Both were bachelors.

182
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,790
Well-respected scholars
with orderly lives.

183
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,790
They had some savings,
nothing much.

184
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,499
Commendator Pazzi?

185
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,665
Yes?

186
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:51,040
I think you're a Pazzi
of the Pazzi, am I correct?

187
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,624
How do you know that?

188
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,165
You resemble a figure
at the Della Robbia rondels

189
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,415
in your family's chapel
at Santa Croce.

190
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,874
Yeah... yeah.

191
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:08,582
That was Andrea de' Pazzi
depicted as John the Baptist.

192
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:13,582
Then there's the most famous
Pazzi of all, Francesco.

193
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,915
He attempted to assassinate
Lorenzo the Magnificent

194
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,082
in the cathedral at Mass, in 1478.

195
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,082
Yeah.

196
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,374
The Pazzi family were all
brought low on that Sunday.

197
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,124
If you come upon anything, Dr Fell,

198
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,957
anything personal from the missing men,
will you call me?

199
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,165
Of course, Commendatore.

200
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,082
WANTED FOR MURDER

201
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,540
'State your business, please.'

202
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,457
I may have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

203
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,499
- 'Do you know where he is now?'
- I believe so.

204
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,999
Is the reward in effect?

205
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:02,790
'Why haven't you called the police?
I'm required to encourage you to do so.'

206
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:07,999
Is the reward payable in...
special circumstances

207
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,415
to someone not ordinarily eligible?

208
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,707
'Do you mean a bounty on Dr Lecter?'

209
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,124
Yes.

210
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,957
'It is against international convention
to offer a bounty for someone's death, sir.

211
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:25,082
- 'Are you calling from Europe?'
- Yes, I am.

212
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,290
That's all I'm telling you.

213
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,207
'I suggest you contact an attorney
to discuss the legality of bounties.

214
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,165
'May I recommend one?
There is one in Geneva.

215
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,499
'I encourage you strongly to call him
and be frank about the matter.

216
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,874
'Would you like the number, sir?

217
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,499
'Sir?'

218
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,124
Yes.

219
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,124
Give me the number.

220
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,915
I prefer the sound and feel
of the harpsichord.

221
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:06,957
More alive, the music arrives
like experience.

222
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,999
Sudden and entire.

223
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,374
The piano has the quality of a memory.

224
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,332
Today has the quality of a memory.

225
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,749
You've met Inspector Pazzi before.

226
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,707
In my youth.

227
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,457
We shared a fondness for Botticelli,

228
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,999
and crossed paths in the Uffizi Gallery
beneath "La Primavera".

229
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:44,249
Does he know... what you are?

230
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,915
When I looked into his face
and stood close enough to smell him,

231
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,457
I was well aware that all the elements
of epiphany were present.

232
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,249
And yet here you are,

233
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,332
free to tell me all about it.

234
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,999
He must wait and lurk and think.

235
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,665
It's too soon to flush his quarry.

236
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,582
He's deciding what to do.

237
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,415
Someone's put a price on your head.

238
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,415
As an early-warning system,
a bounty is better than radar.

239
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,332
It inclines authorities everywhere
to forsake their duty

240
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,957
and scramble after me privately.

241
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,332
Should Rinaldo Pazzi join
Professor Sogliato

242
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,540
and the late curator of the Palazzo
down in the damp?

243
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,832
Should his body be found
after an apparent suicide?

244
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,290
No.

245
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:56,165
Rinaldo Pazzi,
a Pazzi of the Pazzi,

246
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,832
chief inspector
at the Florentine Questura,

247
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,165
has to decide
what his honour is worth.

248
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:08,707
What is it worth to be known
as the man who caught Hannibal Lecter?

249
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,249
For a policeman,
credit has a short half-life.

250
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,749
Better to sell me.

251
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,874
I like the night.

252
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,540
It's more than a period of time.

253
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,582
It's another place.

254
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,290
It's different from where we are
during the day.

255
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,207
We're different from who we are
during the day.

256
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,832
Little more hidden, little less seen.

257
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,165
When life is most like a dream.

258
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,749
Why are you searching for him?

259
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,249
What are you hoping to find?

260
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,957
I'm not searching for Hannibal.

261
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,332
I know exactly where he is.

262
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,749
Is he in Florence?

263
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,374
Yes.

264
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,207
Why didn't you tell me you knew?

265
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,832
I told you.

266
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,207
There are means of influence...

267
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,165
...other than violence.

268
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:06,707
But violence is what you understand.

269
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,499
'Hello, Rinaldo.'

270
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,290
Hello.

271
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,540
'Thank you so much
for reaching out.'

272
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:02,624
Without the cooperation
of concerned citizens such as yourself,

273
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,665
monsters like Hannibal Lecter
would be running wild.

274
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,665
Shall we?

275
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,374
Let's.

276
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,749
I will privately pay
three million dollars

277
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,707
for the doctor alive,

278
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:22,040
no questions asked,
discretion guaranteed.

279
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:26,540
Those terms include
a $100,000 advance.

280
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:30,040
To qualify for the advance,
you must provide

281
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:35,040
a positively identifiable fingerprint
from Dr Lecter.

282
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,624
'Capito?'

283
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,457
Yes, yes, yes.

284
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,165
I understand.

285
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:48,874
I will require a fresh fingerprint
in situ and unlifted,

286
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,499
on an object for my experts
to examine independently.

287
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,957
Now you don't want
to alarm the doctor.

288
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,415
He may disappear too well and...

289
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,874
'I would be left with nothing.'

290
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,165
Sì.

291
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:08,374
So you have no illusions about
what's going to happen to Dr Lecter?

292
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,832
You would be selling him
into torture and death.

293
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,582
'I'm aware.'

294
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,749
You'll get the rest of the money

295
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:19,374
when he's delivered alive
and in our hands.

296
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:25,332
I don't want Dr Lecter
near Florence when you...

297
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,582
'I understand your concern.
Don't worry, he won't be.

298
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,790
'Toodle-oo.'

299
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,249
Hannibal's going to kill him,
you know.

300
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,582
Dr Fell?

301
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,874
Buonasera, commendatore.

302
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,124
Buonasera, Dottor Fell.

303
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,582
Back so soon?

304
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,124
Given the nature of your exhibition

305
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,207
and the contents
of our last conversation,

306
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,832
I brought something
I thought you might like to see.

307
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,874
It was supposedly worn
by Francesco de' Pazzi

308
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,499
when he met his end.

309
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,957
My family's guilt cast in iron.

310
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,665
A scold's bridle.

311
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,832
- May I?
- Of course.

312
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,624
A wonderful heirloom.

313
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,624
I'm so glad you stopped by,
Commendator Pazzi,

314
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,374
as I have a family heirloom for you.

315
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,124
Yeah?

316
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:45,624
Beneath the figure is written a name.
Can you make it out?

317
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,332
- It says "Pazzi".
- This is your ancestor, Francesco.

318
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,374
Hanging outside the Palazzo.

319
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:56,832
This particular illustration is "bowels out".
I've seen others "bowels in".

320
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:01,499
By all accounts, Francesco was led
astray by thirty pieces of silver

321
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,540
from the hand of the Papal banker.

322
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,874
It's hard to see,
but here's where the archbishop bit him.

323
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,832
Eyes wild as he choked,

324
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,457
the archbishop locked his teeth
in Pazzi's flesh.

325
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,999
On a related subject,
I must confess,

326
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,290
I've been giving very serious
thought to doing the same.

327
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:49,999
Thank you.

328
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,540
He said he would be home by now.

329
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,874
What has he done?

330
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,540
Can you hear me, Signor Pazzi?

331
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,374
Take a deep breath while you can.

332
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,332
Clear your head.

333
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,707
I haven't had a bite all day.

334
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:59,832
Actually, your liver and kidneys would
be suitable for dinner right away.

335
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,957
Tonight, even.

336
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,415
But the rest of the meat
should hang at least a week

337
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,457
in the current cool conditions.

338
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,457
I didn't see the forecast. Did you?

339
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,249
I gather that means no.

340
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,749
If you tell me what I need to know,
Commendatore,

341
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,832
it would be convenient for me
to leave without my meal.

342
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,457
I will ask you the questions
and then we'll see.

343
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,665
You can trust me, you know?

344
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,540
Though I expect you find trust difficult,
knowing yourself.

345
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,665
When the police didn't come,
it was clear that you had sold me.

346
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,832
Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?

347
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,124
Yes.

348
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,540
Thank you.

349
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,124
I called the number
on his "wanted" site once,

350
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,124
far from here, just for fun.

351
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:05,124
Have you told anyone
at the Questura about me?

352
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,124
Is that a no?

353
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,082
Excuse me.

354
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,332
Pronto.

355
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:21,832
Inspector Pazzi,
my name is Alana Bloom.

356
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:24,249
'You don't know me,
but I know your benefactor.'

357
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,540
Hello, Alana.

358
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,874
I'm afraid the inspector
is otherwise occupied.

359
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,040
Is he dead?

360
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:37,665
There is nothing I would love more
than to be able to chat with you, Alana,

361
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,665
but you caught me
at a rather awkward moment.

362
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,874
Nice to hear your voice.

363
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,124
So, Commendatore,
which do you think?

364
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,832
Bowels in or bowels out?

365
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,374
Out, I think.

366
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,915
Hello, Jack.

367
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,790
Did you get my note?

368
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:19,624
I'm truly sorry about Bella.

369
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:26,832
For her, night and day must've been
very much the same in the end.

370
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,499
When she could no longer
stir or speak...

371
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,540
...did you speak for her?

372
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,499
I imagine you were capable of giving

373
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,832
any medication Bella may have
needed in the night.

374
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:50,290
Did you practise injections
on an orange, Jack?

375
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,165
What medication did you give her
in the end?

376
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,165
Was it too much?

377
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,915
Just enough?

378
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:21,707
I brought Bella back from death
and you've returned her to it.

379
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,790
Is that where you're taking me, Jack?

380
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:34,957
How will you feel when I'm gone?

381
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,415
Alive.
