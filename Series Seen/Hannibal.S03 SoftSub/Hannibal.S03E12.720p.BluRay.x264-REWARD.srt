1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:02,707
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,665
I can't be with you.

3
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:07,415
You're becoming.
The dragon is your higher self.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:11,124
There's a family out there
who don't know he's coming.

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,665
They're not my family, and I'm not
letting them die. You are.

6
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,749
- What did you say to him?
- "Save yourself. Kill them all."

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,082
Then I gave him your home address.

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,415
How's the wife?

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,124
I look at my wife and I see her dead.

10
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,624
I see Mrs Leeds and Mrs Jacobi
lying where Molly should be.

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,999
Do you see yourself
killing her?

12
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,749
Yes.

13
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,040
Over and over.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,040
It's hard to predict
when brittle materials will break.

15
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:13,290
Hannibal gave you three years
to build a family,

16
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:19,040
confident that he would find a way
to take them from you.

17
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,832
And he has.

18
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,790
What's he going to take from you?

19
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:35,999
Is it important to you that
he take something from me?

20
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:46,374
Hannibal has agency in the world.

21
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:51,957
Hannibal has no intention
of seeing me dead

22
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:56,165
by any other hand than his own.

23
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,832
And only then, if he can eat me.

24
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,832
He's in no position to eat me now.

25
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,290
If you play...

26
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,790
...you pay.

27
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,207
You have paid dearly.

28
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:30,415
It excites him to know that
you are marked in this particular way.

29
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,165
- Why?
- Why do you think?

30
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,040
Bluebeard's wife.

31
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,624
Secrets you're not to know,
yet sworn to keep.

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,249
If I'm to be Bluebeard's wife,

33
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:46,332
I would have preferred to be the last.

34
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,415
Is Hannibal...

35
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,749
...in love with me?

36
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:03,957
Could he daily feel
a stab of hunger for you

37
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,707
and find nourishment
at the very sight of you?

38
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,915
Yes.

39
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:21,082
But do you ache for him?

40
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,249
Will's thoughts are no more bound
by fear or kindness

41
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,499
than Milton's were by physics.

42
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,832
He is both free and damned
to imagine anything.

43
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,582
Now that he's imagined the worst.

44
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,082
Like ducklings, we imprint
on those ideas that grab our attention.

45
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,749
What's got your attention, Doctor?

46
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,249
God, the Devil and
the Great Red Dragon?

47
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,124
Lest we forget the Lamb.

48
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,915
Will is the Lamb of God?

49
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,999
Hide us from the wrath of the Lamb.

50
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,082
Who's "us"?

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,749
You, me and the Great Red Dragon.

52
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,707
The Lamb's wrath touches
everyone who errs.

53
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,415
His retribution is even more deadly
than the Dragon's.

54
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,290
It is for you.

55
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,874
The seals are being opened, Jack.

56
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,374
The lamb is becoming a lion.

57
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,832
"For the great day of his wrath is come;
and who shall be able to stand?"

58
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,040
I'll still be standing.

59
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,165
Is your conscience clear?

60
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,499
As clear as yours.

61
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,249
Righteousness is what
you and Will have in common.

62
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,999
"In righteousness, the Lamb
doth judge and make war."

63
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,999
War against the Great Red Dragon.

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,290
He's not the Dragon, you are.

65
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,624
The Devil himself bound in the pit.

66
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,582
Then that makes you God, Jack.

67
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,540
Yes, it does.

68
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,040
All gods demand sacrifices.

69
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,915
We don't have anything else.

70
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,457
Eight people dead in a month.
We can't play the long game.

71
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,624
You know and I know
it's the best way to bait him.

72
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,707
Got me on the hook, now you're
dangling me to catch a bigger fish.

73
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,790
It was your suggestion.

74
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,082
And you're thrilled
you didn't have to make it.

75
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,082
You once fooled yourselves
into believing you were in control

76
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,457
of what was happening.

77
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,999
Are you still under that delusion?

78
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:57,707
The Dragon has a certain
abstract curiosity about me.

79
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,832
All psychopaths are narcissists,
they love to read about themselves.

80
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,374
If you were smart, Jack,
you would use Freddie Lounds.

81
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,999
She will need to interview you, Will.
Take your picture.

82
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:12,999
I'm in it now.
Can't go home as long as he's loose.

83
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,374
So, I really bad-mouth
the Red Dragon in TattleCrime.

84
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,999
Give him a shot at me.

85
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,915
It's gotta be a really good shot.
What about the set-up?

86
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,082
Something open. Someplace
where he can get close to me.

87
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:34,707
It feels like a trap to me.
And it'll feel like a trap to him.

88
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:42,582
Unless you have a professional voice
who will legitimise what you're saying.

89
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,707
Someone to hide the wire of the snare?

90
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,249
Are you volunteering?

91
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,624
No.

92
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,957
I'd have to be a fool.

93
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,874
Since your commitment,
you have written some brilliant articles

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,207
for The Northern Medical Journal
of Psychiatry.

95
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,915
Thank you, Frederick.

96
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:08,915
I just finished your most recent piece.
Extraordinary stuff!

97
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,332
- A particularly good one.
- It may be my favourite.

98
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,832
I have seen a lot of hostility.

99
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,457
But this was quantifiably bitchy!

100
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,290
Do you think I am your nemesis?

101
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,249
No. Nemesis? No.

102
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,999
- You refuted my entire book.
- It didn't hold up to scrutiny.

103
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,707
Of course it didn't, I was lying!

104
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,582
On your behalf!

105
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,457
To save your life!

106
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,999
You refuted your insanity defence.

107
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:45,290
I went out on a limb for you and
you climbed up there and sawed it off!

108
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:49,082
"Wood burns because
it has the proper stuff in it;

109
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,249
"and a man becomes famous
because he has the proper stuff in him."

110
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,290
You don't have the proper stuff,
Frederick.

111
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,165
I am a best-selling author.

112
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,582
The journals only still publish
your writing

113
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,540
for the freak value of your by-line.

114
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,790
The attention given to you
is dwindling

115
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,749
since you have been overshadowed
by another creature.

116
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,832
That book is writing itself.

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,374
I think I'll call it The Dragon Slayer.

118
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,707
All I need is the ending.

119
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:38,540
Fate has a habit of not letting us
choose our own endings, Frederick.

120
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,374
This is the ending
fate has chosen for you.

121
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,165
Your teeth will go and your strength.

122
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,332
Nobody will be afraid of you anymore.

123
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,707
After Dr Bloom's reign,
you will be out in the ward.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,332
The young ones will push you around
and use you for sex.

125
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,665
All you'll get to read is
what you write on the wall.

126
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,999
You have seen the old ones.

127
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:16,915
They cry when they do not like
the stewed apricots.

128
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,082
Oh...

129
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:33,040
I'm just going to leave an extra copy
of my book right over here.

130
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,749
Thank you, Frederick.

131
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,999
I've personalised it for you.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,624
Are you here to remonstrate me
with "I told you so"?

133
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,874
That's not why I'm here.

134
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,499
She's here
because we need someone

135
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,999
who's less concerned about the truth
than the best story.

136
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,957
Dr Chilton, lay out your theories and
Will will aggravate them for the record.

137
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,624
You're making statements

138
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,874
no investigator would ever make
and no straight newspaper would credit.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,165
You're not
a straight newspaper.

140
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:15,665
You sell T-shirts that say:
"The Tooth Fairy Is A One-Night Stand."

141
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,374
I can get you one, if you like.
You small or medium? Small, I bet.

142
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,249
They aren't selling so well since
you started calling him "The Dragon".

143
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,082
The killer's objection to the name
"The Tooth Fairy" is likely grounded

144
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,040
in the homosexual implication
of the word "fairy".

145
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:35,207
Tedious, I know,
but if you really want to piss him off,

146
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,457
that's what you should call him.

147
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,082
Very well. "Tooth Fairy" it is.

148
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,290
The Tooth Fairy's actions
indicate a projective delusion

149
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,249
compensating for intolerable
feelings of inadequacy.

150
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,749
Smashing mirrors ties these feelings
to his appearance...

151
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:03,790
And not only is the Tooth Fairy insane,
he is ugly and impotent.

152
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:09,457
There's a strong bonding
of aggressive and sexual drives

153
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,082
that occurs in sadists
at an early age...

154
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:17,040
He's a vicious, perverted,
sexual failure. An animal.

155
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,249
The savage acts aimed primarily
at the women,

156
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,415
performed in the presence of families,
are clearly strikes at a maternal figure...

157
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,707
The Tooth Fairy is the product
of an incestuous home.

158
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,582
This is the child of a nightmare.

159
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,874
Will, I think we need a key shot of you
here in your "Washington hideaway".

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,290
I'd love something of you
in a bathrobe,

161
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:49,832
sitting at a desk, poring over
this artist's conception of the Fairy.

162
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,707
I'll stand by the window.

163
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,207
Make sure you can see
the fountain and the Capitol dome.

164
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,332
The Red Dragon needs to be able
to find this place, if he wants to.

165
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,999
Frederick, would you like
to be in the photograph?

166
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,207
One for the dust jacket.

167
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,540
That's it, up.

168
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,124
There.

169
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,374
This whole procedure
is way too passive for my taste.

170
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,082
We are playing games
in the dark of the moon.

171
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,915
He thinks he can do anything.
Maybe he thinks he can stop.

172
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,165
If he can hold off until we catch him,
maybe we can help him make it stop.

173
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,957
He almost killed your wife and son.

174
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,582
Hannibal almost killed them.

175
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,582
All right, pedestrian traffic
falls off around 7:15.

176
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,249
You should go for a walk,
say 8:30 or so.

177
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,582
He'll have to cross open ground
to get close.

178
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,790
- He'll want to get close.
- I've got snipers on the roofs.

179
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,874
You'll be wearing body armour.

180
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,207
Seven out of eleven times,
he's gone for the headshot, Jack.

181
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,624
Yeah...

182
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,082
That's absurd.
That's not what I said at all.

183
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:30,082
Dr Lecter gave misleading answers
in my interviews.

184
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,624
I will refute his refutations

185
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,165
in my new book,
"Blood And Chocolate".

186
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,624
Supermarket tabloids love Hannibal
Lecter more than alien abductions.

187
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,082
That is his demographic now.

188
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,290
We know who his fans are...

189
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,707
Would you like a blanket?

190
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,874
I'll get you a blanket.

191
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,707
Oh, my back hurts.

192
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,915
Oh, my skin.

193
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,415
Oh, did I get burned?

194
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,874
Did I...did I get burned?

195
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,082
Hope, dear God, I am not burned.

196
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,124
Burned?

197
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,999
Burned...

198
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,040
Burned.

199
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,915
No.

200
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,499
You just rest there.

201
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,999
What am I doing here?

202
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,040
Atoning, Dr Chilton.

203
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,457
I have not seen your face.

204
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,124
I could not...
I could not identify you.

205
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,415
I do not know what you look like.

206
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,332
Do you know who I am?

207
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,624
No. No. I do not want to know,
believe me.

208
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,165
According to you,

209
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,207
I'm a vicious,

210
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,540
perverted,

211
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,832
sexual failure.

212
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,457
An animal.

213
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,374
You know now, don't you?

214
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,499
Yes.

215
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,832
Why did you lie, Dr Chilton?

216
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:08,582
Do you understand what I'm doing?

217
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,499
No. No!

218
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:17,332
But I think I have an opportunity
to understand.

219
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,457
Then all my readers
could understand, too.

220
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,415
Do you feel privileged?

221
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,832
It is a privilege. But...

222
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,582
...I have to tell you, I am scared.

223
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:42,457
Man to man, I am scared.

224
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,665
And it is...

225
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,957
it is very hard to, er...

226
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,665
to concentrate when you are scared.

227
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:55,332
If you have got a great idea,
you do not need to scare me

228
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,457
for me to be impressed, OK?

229
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,874
"Man to man."

230
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,290
You use that phrase
to imply frankness.

231
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,790
But you see, I am not a man.

232
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,749
I have become Other

233
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,249
and More than a man.

234
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:32,124
Do you think God is
in attendance here?

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,624
Are you praying to him now?

236
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:47,790
We pray to God mostly
when we are scared.

237
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,999
And does God help you?

238
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,957
No.

239
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,290
I don't know, I don't know.
I do not know.

240
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:06,374
I do...I do...I ought...
I do not think about it after.

241
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,707
- I ought to.
- You ought to.

242
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,624
I ought to.

243
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:19,040
There are so many things
that you ought to understand.

244
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,040
And in a little while,
I will help you understand.

245
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,374
No, I do not want to see your face!

246
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,374
When you turn around,
you will open your eyes and look at me.

247
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,665
Or I will staple your eyelids
to your forehead.

248
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,790
D? It's me.

249
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:07,165
If you make a sound, I will kill her.

250
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,040
I don't like surprises.
I bet you don't, either.

251
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,415
I tried to call you.

252
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,457
May I come in?

253
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,290
I won't be long.

254
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,457
I asked my taxi to wait.

255
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,582
How are you feeling?

256
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,374
OK.

257
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,624
- Your office said you were sick.
- The flu.

258
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,832
You shouldn't be here.

259
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,124
I brought you soup.

260
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,707
I...I didn't come
just to give you soup, D.

261
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,582
I guess I'm guilty of liking you.

262
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,499
Demonstrably guilty.

263
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,165
And I know you like me, too.

264
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,582
I do.

265
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:43,499
I've learned that withdrawal
can be a strategy to avoid pain.

266
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,207
I have a deep vein
of cripple's anger in me.

267
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:53,832
While I can't get rid of it,
I've made it work for me.

268
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,249
It's fuelled my independence.

269
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:05,124
I'm not so scarred by life
that I'm incapable of love.

270
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,165
I hope you aren't, either.

271
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,374
Enjoy the soup.

272
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:37,124
Do you want to know
what I am?

273
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,707
More than anything.

274
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,249
I was afraid to ask.

275
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,165
Look.

276
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,499
- Do you see now?
- Yes.

277
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,665
- Do you see?
- Yes.

278
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,874
Do you see?

279
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,374
- Do you see?
- Yes.

280
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,040
Do you see?

281
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,624
Yes!

282
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,832
Do you...see?

283
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,624
Yes!

284
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,999
Do...you...see?

285
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,332
God!

286
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,499
Do you see?

287
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,124
Please! No!

288
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,874
- No what?
- Not me.

289
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,374
Are you going to tell more lies
about me, Dr Chilton?

290
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,665
- No, no, no...
- Why did you tell lies, Dr Chilton?

291
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,040
It was the police who told me to.
They...they said it.

292
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,999
You quote Will Graham.

293
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:53,332
Graham...told the lies. Graham!

294
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:58,165
Will you tell the truth now
about me? About my work?

295
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,707
My Becoming?

296
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,457
My Art, Dr Chilton?

297
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:11,290
Is...this...Art?

298
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,874
Art.

299
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,957
You said that I,

300
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,582
who see more than you,
am insane.

301
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:29,124
I, who has pushed the world

302
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,874
so much further than you,
am insane.

303
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,540
I have dared more than you.

304
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:43,290
I am the Dragon
and you call me insane?

305
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,915
Before me,

306
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:51,749
you are a slug in the sun.

307
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:58,915
You are privy to a great Becoming,
and you recognise nothing!

308
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:03,540
It is in your nature
to do one thing correctly,

309
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:07,207
and before me you tremble.

310
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,290
Fear is not what you owe me.

311
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:15,624
You owe me...awe!

312
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,957
For your journey home.

313
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,082
Ice.

314
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,999
You will need that.

315
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,082
But before we go,

316
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:46,915
I think we should tape
for a little while.

317
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,290
Look straight down the lens.

318
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,165
Repeat after me.

319
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:24,290
Dr Chilton, you did very well.

320
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,499
You will let me go now?

321
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,082
I will.

322
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,374
Although...

323
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,915
...there is one way...

324
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,832
...that I can help you
better understand...

325
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,457
...and remember.

326
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,707
I want to understand.

327
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,582
And I've got a very good memory.

328
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,207
Hand delivered.

329
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:57,082
- May I open it privately?
- You may not.

330
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:32,582
Dr Chilton often offended me,
so I certainly understand the sentiment.

331
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,207
Where's the other one?

332
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,207
This one can provide you
anything the other one can.

333
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,249
I'm sorry, Jack. The tragedy of what's
happened to Frederick has put me

334
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,207
in an excellent humour.

335
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:01,415
Dr Chilton disappeared yesterday,
under armed escort.

336
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:05,707
You pretended to burn Freddie Lounds
in a wheelchair to flush me out.

337
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,832
What were you pretending to do
with Frederick Chilton?

338
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,040
He profiled the Dragon.

339
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,249
For Freddie Lounds.

340
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,207
We wanted to enrage him.

341
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,749
Congratulations.

342
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:26,540
You could've provided
anything Dr Chilton could.

343
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,665
That would've been your lip
I was tasting. Again.

344
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,874
You publicly discredited Dr Chilton.

345
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,749
By refuting him,
you orchestrated his end by proxy.

346
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,290
You orchestrated his end, Alana.

347
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,790
You saw the hole
and let him roll right into it.

348
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,915
That's professional discourtesy.

349
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,415
'I have had a great privilege.

350
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,415
'I have seen
with wonder and awe

351
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,207
'the strength
of the Great Red Dragon.

352
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:10,415
'All that I said was lies
from Will Graham.

353
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:16,915
'I have blasphemed
against the Dragon.

354
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:22,582
'Even so, the Dragon is merciful.

355
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,624
'Because I was forced to lie,

356
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,665
'he will be more merciful to me
than to you, Will Graham.

357
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:37,957
'Reach behind you and feel

358
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,457
'the small knobs
on the top of your pelvis.

359
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:45,249
'Feel your spine between them.

360
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:53,040
'That is the precise spot where
the Dragon will snap your spine.

361
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,832
'There is much for you to dread.

362
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:02,457
'From my own lips,
you will learn a little more to dread.'

363
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,832
Would you like to talk about what
happened with Frederick Chilton?

364
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,957
The divine punishment of a sinner...

365
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:49,124
...mirrors the sin being punished.

366
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:56,874
Contrapasso.
You play, you pay.

367
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:05,457
Chilton languished, unrecognised,

368
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,249
until "Hannibal the Cannibal."

369
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,957
He wanted the world to know his face.

370
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,040
And now he doesn't have one.

371
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,374
Damned if I'll feel.

372
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:29,749
We are all making our way
through the Inferno.

373
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,082
Dante's pilgrims.

374
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,415
No, we're not pilgrims.
We are pets.

375
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:40,749
And the Great Red Dragon
kills pets first.

376
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,749
You put your hand on Dr Chilton's
shoulder in the photograph.

377
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:55,582
Touch gives the world
an emotional context.

378
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,999
The touch of others
makes us who we are.

379
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,249
It builds trust.

380
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,999
I put my hand on his shoulder
for authenticity.

381
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,457
To establish that he really told you

382
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,832
those insults about the Dragon?

383
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:24,749
Or maybe you wanted
to put Dr Chilton at risk?

384
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,040
Just a little?

385
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,665
I wonder.

386
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,749
Do you have to wonder?

387
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,749
No.

388
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:52,582
What did you think
the Great Red Dragon would do?

389
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:01,207
You were curious what would happen,
that's apparent.

390
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,624
Is this what you were expecting?

391
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,957
I can't say I am surprised.

392
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:18,874
Then you may as well
have struck the match.

393
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:27,665
That's participation.

394
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:37,915
Hannibal Lecter does have
agency in the world.

395
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,749
He has you.

396
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:39,540
He's trashed. He did Chilton like it
looked like you did Freddie Lounds.

397
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,207
Hannibal said he would
in his own way.

398
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,665
Hannibal told him to.

399
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,874
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

400
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,957
I had the SWAT team.

401
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,874
Chilton said your name
when they brought him into the ER.

402
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,582
He's trashed.
You ought to get ready for this.

403
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,374
Frederick, it's Will Graham.

404
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,457
I'm sorry this happened to you.

405
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,665
Can you understand
what he's saying?

406
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,665
He said...

407
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,874
"You set me up. You knew it.

408
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,082
"You put your hand on me
in the picture like a pet."

409
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,957
Did you see anything?

410
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,915
"A black woman. She's blind."

411
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:02,582
"Reba." The Dragon said her name
when he called Lecter.

412
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,415
We're here.

413
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:12,249
If I untie you and let you sit up,
will you be good?

414
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:26,499
I didn't know you cared
this much about me.

415
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:30,207
I'm glad you feel that way,
but you scared me with this.

416
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,499
I never hurt you.

417
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,040
I never wanted to.

418
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,874
Let's just be friends and have
a good time and forget about this...

419
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,832
Shut up.

420
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,665
I'm going to tell you something.

421
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:50,457
The most important thing
that you will ever hear.

422
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,790
"Sermon-on-the-Mount" important.

423
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:58,999
"Ten-Commandments" important.
Got it?

424
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,040
- Yes, D. I don't...
- Shut up.

425
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:07,415
Some remarkable events

426
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,124
have happened
in Chicago and Buffalo.

427
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,290
Do you know what I'm talking about?

428
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:15,874
No.

429
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,249
It's been on the news a lot.

430
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,624
Two groups of people were changed.

431
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,582
Leeds and Jacobi.

432
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,415
The police think
that they were murdered.

433
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:40,249
You know now?

434
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,582
Do you know what they call...

435
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,040
...the Being that visited
those people?

436
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,749
- The Tooth F...
- Think.

437
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,290
Answer correctly.

438
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,790
It's...Dragon something.

439
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,540
Dragon... Red Dragon.

440
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,332
I...

441
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,749
...am...

442
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:15,249
...the Dragon.
