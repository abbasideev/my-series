1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,665
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:05,457
I'm going to cut off your face
without anaesthesia, Mr Graham.

3
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:08,915
I was trying to save Will from you.
Promise me you'll save him.

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,082
I promise.
And I always keep my promises.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,749
You finally caught
the Chesapeake Ripper, Jack.

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,665
I didn't catch you.
You surrendered.

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,957
I want you to know exactly where I am.
And where you can always find me.

8
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,124
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah...

9
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,582
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah...

10
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,040
Bâtard-Montrachet and tartufi bianchi.

11
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,624
How I found you in Florence.

12
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,999
Betrayed by good taste.

13
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:21,790
Is good taste itching at you in your
daily rounds of institutional life?

14
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,457
An itch easy enough to scratch
when there's cause to celebrate.

15
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,540
Congratulations, Hannibal.
You're officially insane.

16
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,457
There's no consensus in the psychiatric
community what I should be termed.

17
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,624
You've long been regarded
by your peers in psychiatry

18
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,540
as something entirely Other.

19
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,207
For convenience,
they term you a monster.

20
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,957
What do you term me?

21
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,665
I don't. You defy categorisation.

22
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,749
Do you still prefer beer to wine?

23
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,540
I stopped drinking beer when I found out
what you were putting in mine.

24
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,207
"Who."

25
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,540
Who.

26
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,082
This means you'll be spared
the federal death sentence.

27
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,457
They had enough to convict you
a dozen times over.

28
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,290
A baker's dozen,
lest we forget Mason Verger.

29
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,957
You're welcome.

30
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,040
You're welcome, Hannibal.

31
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:35,999
The needle was guaranteed,
but you beat it all on an insanity plea.

32
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,374
I'm not insane.

33
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,665
You know that and I know that.

34
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,957
A dozen or a baker's dozen,
enough people have died.

35
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,749
You haven't.

36
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,124
A promise in waiting, isn't it?

37
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,665
A promise you intend to keep.

38
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,749
I always keep my promises.

39
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,249
Shh...

40
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,082
S-s-s-s...

41
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,582
S-s-s...

42
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,082
Sanguinaccio dolce.

43
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,874
A classic Neapolitan dessert,
with almond milk.

44
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,957
Easy on the stomach.

45
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,415
Sanguinaccio dolce.
You have served me this before.

46
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,207
One of my favourite desserts.

47
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,749
Traditionally made with pigs' blood.
In this case, a local cow.

48
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,124
And when you last made it for me?

49
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,540
The blood was from a cow
only in the derogatory sense.

50
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,374
Hmm...

51
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,915
Blood and chocolate.

52
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,124
That should've been
the subtitle of my book.

53
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,040
But I promised myself
I would never use colons in my titles.

54
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,874
Colons lose their novelty when overused.

55
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,374
- You'll have to write another book.
- Hmm, I am.

56
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,665
But not about you.

57
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:06,082
Like overused punctuation, the novelty
of Hannibal Lecter has waned.

58
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,415
What is the subject
of your new book, Frederick?

59
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,957
The Tooth Fairy.

60
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,082
I find folks are a bit more
interested in him.

61
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,290
He is the debutante.

62
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,540
Although he lacks
your love of presentation.

63
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,707
More of a shy boy, this one.

64
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,332
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

65
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,457
What do you think
about the Tooth Fairy?

66
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,124
I think he doesn't like
being called the Tooth Fairy.

67
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,290
It's not as snappy
as Hannibal the Cannibal,

68
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,165
but he does have a much wider
demographic than you do.

69
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:51,249
You, with your fancy allusions
and your fussy aesthetics,

70
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,624
you will always have niche appeal,

71
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,124
but this fellow, there is something
so universal about what he does.

72
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,874
Kills whole families.
And in their homes.

73
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,207
Strikes at the very core
of the American Dream.

74
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,332
You might say
he's a four-quadrant killer.

75
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,332
Get out of my chair, Frederick.

76
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,207
Shall we join hands
in a prayer of gratitude?

77
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:41,332
"Thank you, Father, for allowing us
to remove this monster,

78
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,457
"monster of monsters,
from your flock.

79
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:50,040
"Thank you on behalf of the souls
we will spare of pain."

80
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,249
Thank you on behalf of the monster.

81
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,290
Was that the magisterial "We"?

82
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,874
It is our cabal, yours and mine.

83
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,624
Hannibal Lecter will spend the rest
of his life in a state institution,

84
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,374
watching the diaper cart go by.

85
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,457
We lied.

86
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,124
You wrote a book of lies.

87
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,457
Not difficult to see lies flying
above my head,

88
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,415
but it's almost impossible
to shoot them down.

89
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,874
Hannibal will shoot them down.

90
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,624
He's written a brilliant piece for
"The American Journal of Psychiatry".

91
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,790
Everything he writes is about
some problem he does not have.

92
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,332
What he's written
is going to be your problem.

93
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,665
It's not so much an article
as it is a rebuttal.

94
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,082
Hard to believe an inmate's opinion

95
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,665
will count for anything
in the professional community.

96
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,249
It's going to count, Frederick,
and it's going to sting.

97
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,415
You think he would've taken
the opportunity to gloat.

98
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:07,249
He'll have plenty of time to gloat,
watching the diaper carts go by.

99
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,165
- So, what did you two talk about?
- The Tooth Fairy.

100
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,249
I've detected a trace
of competitive vanity in our man.

101
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,915
I would be cautious.

102
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,124
The Young Turk may inspire
the Old Lithuanian

103
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,790
to keep himself interesting.

104
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,790
Thank you.

105
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,415
You don't wanna talk inside?

106
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,207
Huh... You don't wanna let me inside.

107
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,624
I've come too far
to let the cold stop me, Will.

108
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,249
Why should the cold stop
what common sense couldn't?

109
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,832
- So you don't wanna talk about it here.
- I don't wanna talk about it anywhere.

110
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,874
You've got to talk about it,
so let's have it.

111
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,040
Just, er... just don't
get out any pictures

112
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,874
cos Molly and Walter
will be back soon.

113
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,249
How much do you know?

114
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,749
Two families killed in their homes
a month apart. Similar circumstances.

115
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,249
Not similar, the same.

116
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,790
You ever think about giving me a call?

117
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,999
No.

118
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,874
You know what it is?

119
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:49,374
I didn't call you,
because... I didn't want to.

120
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,249
I don't think I can be
of any use to you, Jack.

121
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,790
I don't think about this anymore.

122
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,415
I don't believe I could do it now.

123
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,790
All dead.

124
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,790
I think this freak is in phase
with the moon.

125
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:16,124
Killed the Jacobis almost
four weeks ago in Chicago. Full moon.

126
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,499
Killed the Leeds family in Buffalo
night before last.

127
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,415
A day short of a lunar month.

128
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,540
With a little bit of luck,

129
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,124
we might have a little more than
three weeks before he does it again.

130
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,749
People dump small dogs here
all the time,

131
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,915
and I can give away the cute ones.

132
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,665
The rest stay and get to be big ones.

133
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,874
Molly's a sucker for strays.

134
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,582
You're not fooling anybody.

135
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,749
You have a nice life here.

136
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,749
Yeah. Yeah, I'm lucky here.
I know that.

137
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,207
- I'm gonna take the dogs out for a pee.
- OK.

138
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,624
Come on, boys. Come here.

139
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,082
Come on.

140
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,415
- How old is he?
- Eleven.

141
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,415
He's going to be taller than you.

142
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,415
Yeah, his father was.

143
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:19,332
I'll come with you.
Come on! Come on!

144
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,165
Come on, let's go.

145
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:33,624
So whatever he says he wants to do,
you'll take him anyway, won't you?

146
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,582
I have to. I promise I'll try to make it
as easy on him as I can.

147
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,124
I know what I'm asking.

148
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,332
I wished to God I didn't have to.

149
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:23,332
How bad is it gonna be if you stay
here and read about the next one?

150
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:29,207
If you stay and there's more killing,

151
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,415
maybe it would sour this place for you.

152
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,832
High Noon and all that.

153
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:44,457
Do you want me to go?

154
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,874
I'd have the satisfaction
that you did the right thing.

155
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,457
He kills families.

156
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,457
If I go...

157
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:08,457
...I'll be different when I get back.

158
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,124
I won't.

159
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:32,124
"Dear Will,
we have all found a new life,

160
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,415
"but our old lives hover
in the shadows.

161
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:39,124
"Soon enough, I fear Jack Crawford
will come knocking.

162
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,124
"I would encourage you, as a friend,

163
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,207
"not to step back
through the door he holds open.

164
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:48,665
"It's dark on the other side
and madness is waiting."

165
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,582
I cut Mr Leeds's throat
as he lies asleep beside his wife.

166
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,040
I shoot Mrs Leeds.

167
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:27,999
The bullet enters to the right of her
navel and lodges in her lumbar spine.

168
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,374
Mr Leeds rises, his throat cut...

169
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,124
...to protect the children.

170
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,915
I shoot one of the two boys in bed.

171
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:58,165
The other boy I pull out from under
his bed and shoot him on the floor.

172
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,624
Losing gallons of blood,

173
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,749
Mr Leeds falls and dies
outside his sons' room.

174
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,415
The smashing of mirrors begins.

175
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:51,457
I moved the family
after they were dead,

176
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:55,624
and later put them back
where they were when I killed them.

177
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:12,082
Talcum powder on the body...

178
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,624
There's none in the house.

179
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,165
I have to touch her.

180
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,957
This isn't my design.

181
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,999
I was told you were told I was coming.
Were you not told?

182
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,249
Your office or agency called me,
of course,

183
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,457
but last night we had to get
the police to remove

184
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,749
an obnoxious flame-haired woman
who was trying to take pictures.

185
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,999
I'm being very careful.
I'm sure you understand, Mr Price.

186
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,415
Agent. Special.

187
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,332
Special Agent Price,

188
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,124
the bodies were only released to us
at one o'clock this morning,

189
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,957
and the funeral's at five this afternoon.
We simply can't delay it.

190
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,499
This won't take very long.

191
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,790
I'll need one reasonably-intelligent
assistant, if you have one.

192
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:43,124
Cancel the reasonably-intelligent
assistant, mine just showed up.

193
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,040
I can't help you with your thing.
I got a thing.

194
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,540
What kind of thing do you got?

195
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,249
I'm reconstructing teeth
from the bite marks on Mrs Leeds

196
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,957
and this cheddar cheese wheel thing
we found in her refrigerator.

197
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,457
Yeah, the Tooth Fairy
was feeling peckish.

198
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:59,124
Well, we'll double-dutch.
Woman's gotta get in the ground.

199
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,457
Voilà.

200
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:21,332
It's a partial. Probably a thumb.

201
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:24,290
- Jimmy, you're the light of my life.
- I know.

202
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,040
The print was smudged.

203
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:29,290
Came off Mrs Leeds's eye.
Never did that before.

204
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,124
Er, I just...

205
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,290
Erm, sorry, but I'm just surprised
to see you back.

206
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,249
Welcome back.

207
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,749
Jimmy...

208
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:43,624
OK. The mirror pieces all had
those smooth prints.

209
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,624
Forefinger on the back of the piece
wedged in her labia,

210
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,749
a smudged thumb on the front.

211
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:53,832
He polished it after he placed it,
so he could see his face in there.

212
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:57,082
One in her mouth was obscured
by blood. Same with the eyes.

213
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:01,124
Ran an AFIS.
He's not in the print index.

214
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,040
We could run a "Have-You-Seen-
These-Teeth?" sort of APB.

215
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,249
They're distinctive.

216
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,749
Pegged lateral incisors, here and here.

217
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,624
The teeth are all crooked.

218
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,124
The central incisor's got
a corner missing.

219
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,207
The other central incisor
has a groove in it.

220
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,207
A snaggletooth son of a bitch.

221
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,290
And he bites. A lot.

222
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:26,915
He may have a history
of biting in lesser assaults.

223
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,499
May be a fighting pattern
as much as sexual behaviour.

224
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,124
What's he fighting, Will?

225
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,832
You were asking about the dog.
Last night, a vet called the police.

226
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,249
Leeds and his oldest boy
took the dog into the vet

227
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:09,290
the afternoon before they were killed.

228
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,415
What's going to happen to it?

229
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,749
Please don't worry about the dog.

230
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:19,749
- What do you expect me to do?
- The best you can, that's all.

231
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:23,415
There's something else I can do.

232
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,832
I can wait until I'm driven to it
by desperation

233
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,040
in the last days before the full moon.

234
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:36,540
Or I could do it now...
while it might be of some use.

235
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,207
Is there an opinion that you want, Will?

236
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,915
It's a mindset I need to recover.

237
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,957
I have to see Hannibal.

238
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,207
Hello, Dr Lecter.

239
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,582
Hello, Will.
