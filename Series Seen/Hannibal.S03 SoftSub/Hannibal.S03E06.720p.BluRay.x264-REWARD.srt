1
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:02,874
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,749
How do you know Hannibal
is in Florence?

3
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:06,290
Botticelli.

4
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:08,707
You're drawing them to you, aren't you?

5
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,249
I'm not searching for Hannibal.
I know exactly where he is.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,707
I will pay three million dollars
for the doctor alive.

7
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,415
I'm Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.

8
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,040
Dr Lecter is careful. He will strike.

9
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,749
You are going to be caught.
It has already been set into motion.

10
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,665
Jack.

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:40,040
He's wounded. And he's worried.

12
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,499
No, Hannibal doesn't worry.

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:49,457
Knowing he's in danger won't rattle him
any more than killing does.

14
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:53,749
If Rinaldo Pazzi had decided to do
his job as an officer of the law,

15
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,332
he would've determined very quickly
that he was Hannibal Lecter.

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,915
It would've taken thirty minutes
to get a warrant.

17
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,582
All those resources
were denied to Pazzi.

18
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:07,707
As soon as he decided to sell Hannibal,
he became a bounty hunter.

19
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,999
Outside the law and alone.

20
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,999
Well, here we are:
outside the law and alone.

21
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:22,457
Have you told la polizia
they're looking for Hannibal Lecter?

22
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,207
They're motivated to find Dr Fell
inside the law.

23
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,874
Knowing who he is, what he's worth,
it'll just coax them out of bounds.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,915
- It'd be a free-for-all.
- And Hannibal will slip away.

25
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,374
Will you slip away with him?

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,082
A part of me will always want to.

27
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,707
You have to cut that part out.

28
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,249
Of course you found him here.

29
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,832
Not because of the exhibit,

30
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,124
but because of the crowd it attracts.

31
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,207
You had him, Jack. He was beaten.

32
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,582
Why didn't you kill him?

33
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,207
Maybe I need you to.

34
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,582
I want to be able to draw these streets
from memory.

35
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:38,415
I want to be able to draw
the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo.

36
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,290
You won't be coming back here
for a very long time.

37
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,832
Memories of Florence will be
all I have.

38
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,665
Florence is where I became a man.

39
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,707
I see my end in my beginning.

40
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,290
All of our endings can be found
in our beginnings.

41
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,582
History repeats itself.

42
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,290
And there is no escape.

43
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,207
You've packed lightly.

44
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,957
I've packed for you.

45
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,124
This is where I leave you.

46
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,290
Or more accurately,
where you leave me.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,999
This isn't how I intended
to say goodbye.

48
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,957
I imagined it differently.

49
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,999
I didn't.

50
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,957
I knew that you intended to eat me.

51
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,999
And I knew that you had
no intention of eating me hastily.

52
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,624
It would be a shame
not to savour you.

53
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,915
I have not marinated long enough
for your tastes.

54
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,249
When they come for you...

55
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,249
And they will come.

56
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,040
What will you say of me?

57
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,499
I will help you tell the version
of events you want to be told.

58
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,707
I will help you
because you asked me to.

59
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,707
You may make a meal of me yet,
Hannibal.

60
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,415
But not today.

61
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:31,457
Pig tails, cut into sections to give
the aesthetic of fingers cut at the joint.

62
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,165
Finger food. Huh!

63
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,957
Hands are how we touch the world.
They're tactile, sensual.

64
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,915
Remove an arm and your patient
will still feel phantom digits.

65
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,290
Imagine how Dr Lecter will feel

66
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,749
when he's watching you
nibble on his fingers.

67
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,874
Oh, poetry, Cordell, poetry.

68
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,082
In a ginger-black vinegar sauce.

69
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,249
Mm... It's mostly skin and bone.

70
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,499
The actual fingers will have more meat.

71
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,540
Then there's the marrow.

72
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,249
Here it is in a fermented bean sauce.

73
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,582
Ugh! I prefer the ginger.

74
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,957
No, no... Spit.

75
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,832
A Buddhist singing bowl. The gong
represents the start of a new day.

76
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,457
Buddhists don't eat meat.

77
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,749
This isn't meat.

78
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,415
This is man.

79
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,082
Papa always used to say
meat was a people business.

80
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,999
He was a pioneer in livestock production,
I'm sure he's eaten someone.

81
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,249
I must admit,
I tremble at the notion myself.

82
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:54,290
I find there's something reassuring
about you eating Dr Lecter.

83
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,457
It makes you the apex predator.

84
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,332
I like that, "apex predator".

85
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,082
- We could Peking duck him.
- Oh?

86
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,790
You have to torture a duck to prepare it.

87
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,957
Pump its skin up with air,

88
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:16,540
then glaze it with a hot honey
and hang it by its neck until it dries.

89
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,540
And then roast until crispy.

90
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,582
Transubstantiation.

91
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,790
I'm here. Tell me.

92
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,540
I feel like I just paid a lot of money
for a dead dago.

93
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,707
The faeces will fly about Pazzi.

94
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:26,040
Better to get it out that Pazzi was dirty.
They'll take it better if he was dirty.

95
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:30,040
- Was he dirty?
- Except for this, I don't know.

96
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,915
What if they trace Pazzi back to you?

97
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,999
Oh, I can take care of that.

98
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,457
You took care of Pazzi.

99
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,999
I have little interest
in the expensive piece of meat

100
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,332
twitching at the end
of that electrical cord, Dr Bloom.

101
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,249
Might want to get interested.

102
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,374
Hannibal could disappear too well
and you'd be left with nothing.

103
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,374
Better buy another cop.

104
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,582
Better buy the whole department.

105
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,249
You must be looking for Hannibal Lecter.

106
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,290
One of his patients?

107
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:48,790
No, not a patient. Where is he?

108
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,790
Seeing how you let yourself in,
forgive me if it's forward for me to ask...

109
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:59,707
- Who the hell are you?
- Family.

110
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:07,374
And you've come all the way from home.

111
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,749
Who are you?

112
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,915
I'm his psychiatrist.

113
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,415
Medicinal purposes.

114
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,124
You're like his bird.

115
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,082
I'm his bird, too.

116
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:31,249
He puts us in cages
to see what we'll do.

117
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,832
Fly away or dash ourselves
dead against the bars.

118
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,082
You haven't flown away.

119
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,040
You are flying right towards him.

120
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:45,207
How does he inspire such devotion?

121
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,165
You're his psychiatrist.

122
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:54,415
You could add to what I've learned
from my experience with him,

123
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,457
and from the mute postures
of the dead.

124
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,665
Were you there?

125
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,332
Did you watch
as the wild beast within him

126
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,874
turned from the teat
and entered the world?

127
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,290
I met the beast.
And I saw him grow.

128
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,374
Someone wants to kill him.

129
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,165
More than one someone, I'd say.

130
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,082
What do you want?

131
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,624
I want to cage him.

132
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,249
I thought Will Graham was
Hannibal's biggest mistake.

133
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,040
I wonder if it isn't you.

134
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,374
Now, if you'll excuse me,

135
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,124
I have to take my medicine.

136
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,457
Mrs Fell, I presume?

137
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,790
My husband is a doctor.
He's been treating my condition.

138
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,249
And what condition is that,
Mrs Fell?

139
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,665
I get confused.

140
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,707
Oh, please!

141
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:31,457
You need to get over yourself,
whatever self that is, Bedelia.

142
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,582
My name is Lydia Fell.

143
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,332
You expect us to believe
that you somehow lost yourself

144
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,582
in the hot darkness
of Hannibal Lecter's mind?

145
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,790
That Lydia Fell is some construct?

146
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,082
- It's you, isn't it?
- Well, now, I'm really confused.

147
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,957
I don't believe you.

148
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:20,707
You are not confused, Bedelia.

149
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,249
That is not my name.

150
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,999
You know who you are
and what you've done.

151
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,124
You know exactly how you're going
to wiggle out of it. What is this?

152
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,832
Sedatives? Hypnotics? Ethanol?
Scopolamine? Midazolam?

153
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,832
Same cocktail
Dr Lecter served Miriam Lass?

154
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,249
You've been freebasing your alibi.

155
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,249
And I'm not even mad at you.

156
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,249
To tell the truth,
I'm fairly impressed.

157
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,665
Mostly because
you're still alive.

158
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,790
When this fog of yours clears...

159
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,374
...I'd love to hear
how you managed that.

160
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,832
You say my husband murdered
a Chief Investigator.

161
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:06,040
Where is the polizia?
Shouldn't they be questioning me?

162
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,290
Don't worry, they will.

163
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,124
They sure are taking their time.

164
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,624
What could possibly be the delay?

165
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,832
No... I have an idea.

166
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,457
- Do you?
- They're being bought.

167
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,374
By the same people
that bought Rinaldo Pazzi.

168
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,249
Interest in my husband
is certainly getting competitive.

169
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,124
Will?

170
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,374
- Will?
- I wonder who will catch him first.

171
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,165
I've made new friends in Italy.
They're cleaning up and starting over.

172
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,582
So, all you need
to concern yourself with now is

173
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,415
what'll happen once Dr Lecter
is in your hands.

174
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,040
You've worked so hard
to give me what I want.

175
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,582
It's only fair to talk about
what Margot wants.

176
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,165
Come sit on Santa's lap.

177
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,707
You know what I want.

178
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:30,499
The biggest regret of my life is
taking away your ability to create it.

179
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,040
Adoption is a nice thing to do.

180
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,707
No pedigree in buying a Chinese baby.
They're cheaper than shoats.

181
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,457
I wish I could give you a Verger baby.

182
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,499
Our own baby, yours and mine.

183
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,749
We could raise it together.

184
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,082
The last time you said
you wanted to have a baby,

185
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,999
you removed my uterus.

186
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,457
In my defence,
you weaponised your uterus.

187
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,124
You shouldn't have been waving it
around like a loaded pistol.

188
00:18:56,083 --> 00:19:00,665
- I brought it on myself.
- As you so often do, Margot.

189
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:06,040
But there's a possibility that
I'm still packing loads of viable sperm.

190
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,040
Stumbled across
any viable uteruses lately, hm?

191
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,624
What are you up to, Mason?

192
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,249
I want us to have a baby, Margot.

193
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,374
I could be really good to a child.

194
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,874
I could take parenting classes.

195
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,374
Let's find a way, Margot.

196
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,457
Let's find a way to be a family again.

197
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,999
If I saw you every day forever, Will,

198
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,249
I would remember this time.

199
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,082
Strange seeing you here
in front of me.

200
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,249
Been staring at afterimages of you
in places you haven't been in years.

201
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,749
"To market, to market,
to buy a fat pig.

202
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,957
"Home again, home again,
jiggity-jig."

203
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,124
I wanted to understand you,

204
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,749
before I laid eyes on you again.

205
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:05,624
I needed it to be clear
what I was seeing.

206
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:14,582
Where does the difference between
the past and the future come from?

207
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,082
Mine?

208
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,165
Before you and after you.

209
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,249
Yours?

210
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,457
It's all starting to blur.

211
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,874
Mischa?

212
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,999
Abigail?

213
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,874
Chiyoh?

214
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,499
How is Chiyoh?

215
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,707
She pushed me off a train.

216
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,082
Atta girl.

217
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,665
You and I have begun to blur.

218
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,124
Isn't that how you found me?

219
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,999
Every crime of yours...

220
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,874
...feels like one I am guilty of.

221
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,582
Not just Abigail's murder,

222
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:30,999
every murder stretching
backward and forward in time.

223
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,999
Freeing yourself from me
and me freeing myself from you,

224
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,040
they're the same.

225
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,082
We're conjoined.

226
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:56,499
I'm curious whether either of us
can survive separation.

227
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,332
Now is the hardest test,

228
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,957
not letting rage and frustration...

229
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,540
...nor forgiveness,
keep you from thinking.

230
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,124
Shall we?

231
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,957
After you.

232
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:49,249
Mason's ahead of the FBI
in the pursuit of Hannibal Lecter.

233
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,540
Mason has no intention
of ever sharing his lead with the FBI.

234
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,249
I do.

235
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:04,207
Once he has Hannibal.

236
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:10,665
There's something I need to get
from Mason before he goes to prison.

237
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,874
Any experience harvesting sperm?

238
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,624
We cannot locate Dr Fell.

239
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:29,749
Close attention has been brought
to bear on him.

240
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,707
We have eyewitness accounts
of a bloody figure,

241
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,874
matching his description,
running from the scene.

242
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,999
The Italian public have already decided
Il Mostro has killed Rinaldo Pazzi.

243
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,540
A twenty-year-old debt finally paid.

244
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,957
The Italian public is right.

245
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,040
Il Mostro died in prison.

246
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:55,040
Il Commendator Pazzi had been
assigned to investigate

247
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:58,040
the disappearance of two men
from the Palazzo Capponi.

248
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:04,415
My husband knew Professor Sogliato.
We were at his home many times.

249
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:07,749
We believe your husband was
responsible for the disappearances,

250
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:12,624
and murdered Pazzi when he came
to the same conclusion.

251
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,374
If you haven't already,
access the ViCAP database at Quantico.

252
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,957
You'll find Dr Fell
on the "Most Wanted" page,

253
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,415
under the name of Hannibal Lecter.

254
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,832
The fingerprints you'll pull
from Pazzi's noose will be his.

255
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,707
If you knew Dr Fell
to be Hannibal Lecter,

256
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,415
why didn't you bring it
to the attention of the Questura?

257
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,999
He had a price on his head.
Pazzi knew about it, tried to sell him.

258
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,165
That kind of money,
I can't blame him. Can you?

259
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,249
You've already been questioned

260
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,915
regarding Rinaldo Pazzi's murder,
Signor Crawford.

261
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:52,999
Since you're not in Florence on
official FBI business, that will be all.

262
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,124
Not you, Signora Fell.

263
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,874
You stay right where you are.

264
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,374
This is going to hurt.
That bullet is still inside you.

265
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,957
Chiyoh has always been
very protective of me.

266
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,832
Did she kill her tenant?
Or did you?

267
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,749
She did.

268
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,415
Excellent.

269
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,790
You dropped your forgiveness, Will.
You forgive how God forgives.

270
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,665
Would you have done it quickly,
or would you have stopped to gloat?

271
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,374
Does God gloat?

272
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,999
Often.

273
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,874
No. No, no, no, no, no...

274
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,749
Give that a moment.

275
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,332
I can almost taste the butter.

276
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,415
Taste and smell are the oldest senses,

277
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,040
and the closest
to the centre of the mind.

278
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,457
Parts that precede
pity and morality.

279
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,290
They play in the dome of our skulls,

280
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,665
like miracles
illuminated on a church ceiling.

281
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,749
The ceremonies and sights
and exchanges of dinner

282
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,540
can be far more engaging
than theatre.

283
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,749
What's for dinner?

284
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:14,624
Never ask.
It spoils the surprise.

285
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:09,207
I don't indulge much in regret,
but... I am sorry to be leaving Italy.

286
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:18,207
There were things in the Palazzo
Capponi I would've liked to read.

287
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,165
I would have liked to play the clavier
or perhaps compose.

288
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,874
I would've liked
to show you Florence, Will.

289
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,249
The soup isn't very good.

290
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,999
It's a parsley and thyme infusion,

291
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,999
and more for my sake than yours.

292
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:01,040
Have another sip.

293
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,749
Let that circulate.

294
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,582
Are we expecting company?

295
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,415
Wrong floor.

296
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,040
Will?

297
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,290
He's under the table, Jack.

298
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:07,165
Your husband left you behind.

299
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,540
I had no reason to run.

300
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,207
I've done nothing wrong.

301
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,749
I hold in my hands the photographs

302
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:24,582
taken for Dr Fell's state work permit.

303
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:30,124
Oh, I also have
his French work papers.

304
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,124
Looks different with a beard, no?

305
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:40,874
- That is not my husband.
- This is Roman Fell.

306
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,874
And this is Lydia Fell.

307
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,124
I am Lydia Fell.

308
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,457
Did you murder her
with your husband?

309
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,374
Or did you just watch?

310
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,457
I am Lydia Fell.

311
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,040
I don't care who you are.

312
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,457
I don't care if you're in your right mind
or your wrong mind, understand?

313
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:21,832
Those things are inconsequential.

314
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:28,832
I understand, in this moment,

315
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,915
you do not work for the Questura.

316
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,249
That's a good thing to understand.

317
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:42,915
I don't want to be seen
as uncooperative.

318
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:49,165
How you are seen is entirely up to you.

319
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,249
Rescued by the brave Questura, or...

320
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,624
...apprehended.

321
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:03,874
I have never considered myself
in need of being... rescued.

322
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,290
Until now.

323
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:09,540
Is your husband still in the city?

324
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:17,540
My husband was hoping to meet
a friend before he left Florence.

325
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,457
Where?

326
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,790
The nature of the meeting
required privacy.

327
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,999
They will be somewhere
no one is supposed to be.

328
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,332
I've taken the liberty of giving you
something to help you relax.

329
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,415
You won't be able to do
much more than chew,

330
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,582
but that's all you'll need to do.

331
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,790
I didn't have an opportunity to ask you
during our last encounter,

332
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,999
but did you enjoy the exhibition?

333
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,790
A different kind of evil minds museum.

334
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,749
Not that different.

335
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:14,165
We were supposed to sit down
together at your house in Baltimore.

336
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,082
Just the three of us.

337
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,249
You were to be the guest of honour.

338
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,624
But the menu was all wrong.

339
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,999
Yes, it was.

340
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,040
Jack was the first to suggest
getting inside your head.

341
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,999
Now we both have the opportunity
to chew quite literally...

342
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:50,540
...what we've only chewed figuratively.

343
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,207
Hannibal...

344
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,415
Stop!

345
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,665
Stop!

346
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,582
Gentlemen.

347
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:24,624
Welcome to Muskrat Farm.
