1
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:22,666
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,541
You know and I know
it's the best way to bait him.

3
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:28,374
So I really bad-mouth
the Red Dragon in TattleCrime.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,458
It feels like a trap to me.

5
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:35,416
'I have blasphemed against the Dragon.
There is much for you to dread.'

6
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,499
You orchestrated his end,
Alana.

7
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,541
I am the Dragon.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,708
Get up. Stand by the bed.

9
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,958
Do you know where you are
in the room?

10
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:57,749
Yes.

11
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,083
And you know where you are
in the house?

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,833
Then you know where the front door is,
don't you?

13
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:17,041
Reba, feel on my chest.

14
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:29,708
Bring your hands up slowly...
Don't do what you're thinking!

15
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:34,208
Just feel on my chest.

16
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,749
Just around my throat.
You feel that?

17
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,749
It's a key.

18
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,333
Take it off over my head.

19
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,874
Careful.

20
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,874
Now...

21
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,124
...I'm going to see
if I can trust you.

22
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,041
Go to the front door, lock it.

23
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,916
Go ahead.

24
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,208
I'll wait right here.

25
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,208
Don't try to run.

26
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,208
I can catch you.

27
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,541
Oh, Reba.

28
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:16,333
Now lock the door,
and put the key around my neck.

29
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,708
Hang it around my neck.

30
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,333
Now let's make sure it's locked,
shall we?

31
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,208
Very good.

32
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,916
Now go on back to the bedroom.

33
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,874
You know the way.

34
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,666
Sit down.

35
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:07,124
Sit still or I can't keep Him off you.

36
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,041
Please try.

37
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,499
Put out your hand.

38
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,249
Feel this.

39
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:25,874
Don't grab it, feel it.

40
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,208
It's a shotgun.

41
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,541
You know what it will do.

42
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,708
Take your hand down.

43
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,541
I wish I could've trusted you.

44
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,291
I wanted to trust you.

45
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,208
You felt so good.

46
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:02,874
So did you, D.
I love it.

47
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,624
Please don't hurt me now.

48
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,249
It's all over for me.

49
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,791
I can't give you to Him.

50
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,041
You know what He will do.

51
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,541
No...

52
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:36,958
No, no, no...

53
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,208
He will bite you.

54
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,499
Better you go with me.

55
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,416
No, no, no, no...

56
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,791
Oh, god, no!

57
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,499
Oh, Reba...

58
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,333
...I-I can't stand to watch you burn.

59
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,791
No!

60
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,874
He shot himself in the face.

61
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:50,083
I put my hand in it.

62
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,041
He set fire to the house.

63
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,208
He shot himself.

64
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,624
I put my hand in it.

65
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,791
He was on...the floor.

66
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,416
I won't put you through this again,

67
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:17,458
but, er... I'd like to come back by,

68
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,749
just to say hi
and see how you're doing.

69
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,416
How could you help it,
a charmer like me?

70
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:44,624
In the end, he couldn't kill you
and he couldn't watch you die.

71
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:51,124
The people who study this kind of thing
say that he was trying to stop

72
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,333
because you helped him.

73
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,083
Probably saved some lives.

74
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,749
I drew a freak.

75
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,458
You didn't draw a freak.

76
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,791
You drew a man...

77
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:07,833
...with a freak on his back.

78
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,416
There is nothing wrong with you.

79
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,333
I know there's nothing wrong with me.

80
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,583
In making friends,
I try to be wary of people

81
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,416
who foster dependency
and feed on it.

82
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:30,041
I've been with a few.
The blind attract them.

83
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,291
Not just the blind.

84
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,791
Ding-dong, the Dragon's dead.

85
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,416
Are congratulations in order?

86
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:24,624
I didn't kill him. Suicide.

87
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,041
Then he wasn't as strong
as the Dragon after all.

88
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,416
He was trying to stop.

89
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,208
I was rooting for you, Will.

90
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,749
It's a shame.

91
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,791
You came all this way
and you didn't get to kill anybody.

92
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,624
The only consolation is Dr Chilton.

93
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,958
Congratulations for the job
you did on him.

94
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,208
I admired it enormously.

95
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,208
What a cunning boy you are.

96
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:15,083
Are you accusing me of something?

97
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,749
Does the enemy inside you
agree with the accusation?

98
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,791
Even a little bit?

99
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,791
I came back to stop the Dragon.

100
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,208
He's stopped.

101
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:36,124
Your family was on his itinerary.

102
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,999
Safe now.

103
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,208
You can go home again,
if there's any point.

104
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,666
Is there any point?

105
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,583
I like my life there.

106
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,208
It won't be the same.

107
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,624
You'll see it's not the same.

108
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,999
The unspoken knowledge
will live with you,

109
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,374
like unwanted company in the house.

110
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,708
Molly and I want it to be the same.

111
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,874
When life becomes
maddeningly polite...

112
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,416
...think about me.

113
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:25,374
Think about me, Will,
don't worry about me.

114
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,416
You turned yourself in,

115
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,666
so I would always know
where you were.

116
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:58,208
You'd only do that if I rejected you.

117
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,416
Goodbye.

118
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,041
Will...

119
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,208
Was it good to see me?

120
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,666
Good?

121
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,291
No.

122
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,624
Do you think you can sit up?

123
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,374
Try to sit up.

124
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,791
You didn't break my back.

125
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:36,541
Your face... is closed to me.

126
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,333
If I can see you...

127
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,708
...you can see me.

128
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,708
Oh, you think you understand,
don't you?

129
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:58,874
"I understand that blood and breath...

130
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:06,416
"...are only elements undergoing change
to fuel your Radiance."

131
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,874
Hannibal said those words.

132
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,708
To me.

133
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,916
I wanted to share with Lecter,

134
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,708
and Lecter betrayed me.

135
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,791
He betrayed me, too.

136
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,708
I would like to share.

137
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,499
You shared...

138
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,374
...with Reba.

139
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:49,541
I shared with Reba a little,
in a way that she could survive.

140
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,249
But you didn't change her.

141
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:58,999
I chose not to change her.
I am stronger than the Dragon now.

142
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:08,041
Hannibal Lecter is
who you need to change.

143
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,708
I want to meet Lecter.

144
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,124
How would I manage that?

145
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:27,249
The only teeth we found in the skull
were grandma's dentures.

146
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,916
And the upper part was made of vulcanite
instead of acrylic like they use today.

147
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,583
No one's made vulcanite plates
in fifty years.

148
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,083
Dolarhyde had a new acrylic set
just like them made to fit him.

149
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,708
Chinese manufacturer.
The new pair we found on the body.

150
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,249
Grandma's old yucky pair
we found in his mouth.

151
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,458
Well, not his mouth, per se.

152
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,166
We think it's a guy named
Arnold Lang. He's missing.

153
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,499
Worked at a service station
near Dolarhyde.

154
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,791
Found his car,
but it'd been wiped clean.

155
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,083
So Dolarhyde snuffs out Lang,

156
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:58,458
takes the dead body back to the house,
does his whole thing with the blind lady,

157
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,749
song and dance, "Will I shoot you?
"Won't I shoot you?"

158
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,749
"I can't stand to see you burn.
Boo-hoo!"

159
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,124
Then blows Lang's head away
with a twelve-gauge.

160
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,458
So the routine of hanging the key around
his neck was to be sure she felt the body.

161
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:13,708
So she could tell us
she certainly felt a body.

162
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,708
The Great Red Dragon lives.

163
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:21,999
The obvious thing is
to get him to come to us.

164
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,791
Bait him with something
he wants more than me.

165
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,166
- He'd have to be an idiot to go for it.
- I know.

166
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,749
Want to hear
what the best bait would be?

167
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,874
I'm not sure I want to.

168
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,249
Hannibal would be the best bait.

169
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:41,916
Why in God's name would anyone
want to meet Hannibal Lecter?

170
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,124
To kill him, Jack.

171
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,208
The Dragon could absorb him
that way, engulf him,

172
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,416
become more than he is.

173
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,874
You sound pretty sure.

174
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,208
I'm not sure. Who's sure?

175
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:02,916
I'm not even sure Hannibal
would draw the Dragon.

176
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:05,916
I just say that it's our best shot.

177
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,708
Set him up how?

178
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,499
We take Hannibal into federal custody.

179
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,208
We fake an escape.

180
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:47,291
We assign a moment to decision.

181
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:52,208
What you propose is so thoughtless...

182
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:58,291
...I find it difficult
to imagine that moment exists.

183
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:02,291
Decisions are made
of kneaded feelings.

184
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:08,208
They're more often a lump
than a sum.

185
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:12,208
However you think

186
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:17,999
you are going to manipulate
this situation to your advantage...

187
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,874
...think again.

188
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:24,083
There's no advantage.

189
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:29,249
It's all degrees of disadvantage.

190
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:34,083
"Who holds the Devil,
let him hold him well.

191
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:39,041
"He will hardly be caught
a second time."

192
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:44,499
I don't intend Hannibal
to be caught a second time.

193
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:52,458
Can't live with him,
can't live without him.

194
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,666
Is that what this is?

195
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,249
I guess...

196
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,749
...this is my Becoming.

197
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,291
What you are "becoming"
is pathological.

198
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:16,916
Extreme acts of cruelty require
a high degree of empathy.

199
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,583
You've just found religion.

200
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:24,499
Nothing more dangerous than that.

201
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,916
I'd pack my bags if I were you, Bedelia.

202
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:35,541
Meat's back on the menu.

203
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:42,333
You righteous, reckless,
twitchy little man.

204
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:46,416
He might as well cut all of our throats
and be done with it.

205
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:52,291
Ready or not, here he comes.

206
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,541
Dr Bloom.

207
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,041
You finally broke down
and came to visit.

208
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:31,541
Your face did not change at all

209
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,208
when you first looked at me.

210
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:39,583
Shock, in seeing me,

211
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:43,249
is usually... delayed.

212
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,249
I wanted to see you, Frederick.

213
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,458
I wanted to remind myself
what Hannibal is capable of.

214
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:57,541
What Hannibal is capable of.

215
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:03,041
What Will Graham is capable of.

216
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:08,416
What you are capable of.

217
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:13,333
You were the roper.

218
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:19,416
Too bad there was not enough rope
for you to hang yourself with.

219
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:26,041
Just enough... to hang me.

220
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,833
Who does Will Graham have you
roping now?

221
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,624
Hannibal.

222
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:47,083
If I had them,
I would burn the man alive.

223
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,124
Though...

224
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:56,416
...maybe I would rather have his skin.

225
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:01,166
I've been getting grafts.

226
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:07,124
How I would love to count Hannibal
among my donors.

227
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,999
You were never comfortable
in your own skin, Frederick.

228
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,458
You wouldn't be comfortable
in Hannibal's.

229
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,499
Are you?

230
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:40,124
There's a deal for you, Hannibal.
Or there could be.

231
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,374
A deal? With whom?

232
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,041
The FBI.

233
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,583
- Jack couldn't ask me himself?
- Jack doesn't know you as well as I do.

234
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,999
He thought if he asked you for help,
you would just torment him.

235
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:03,874
Quite right, too. How wise of Jack.

236
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,666
The Red Dragon faked his death.

237
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,124
Good for him.

238
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,583
Jack wants to fake your escape.

239
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:21,333
I release you into police custody,
and Jack uses you as bait.

240
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,916
Was it Will's idea?

241
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,291
Yes.

242
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:34,541
Yes, that worked out so well
for Frederick Chilton.

243
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,999
Do please tell Frederick,
if you see him,

244
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:42,208
I wish a speedy convalescence
and hope he won't be very ugly.

245
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,249
I've been on the phone for hours on
your behalf, and this is what you get...

246
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:52,458
Any rational society would either
kill me or give me my books.

247
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:58,541
If you cooperate in the capture
of Francis Dolarhyde,

248
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:02,583
you get your books,
your drawings, your toilet.

249
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:06,291
All privileges will be restored.

250
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,999
You trust Will with my well-being?

251
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,208
As much as I trust you with his.

252
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,041
You trust me with yours?

253
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,458
You intend to release me
into police custody.

254
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:28,541
Police are not as wise as you are.

255
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:35,124
I might escape in earnest
and come to kill you.

256
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,583
First chance you get, I assume.

257
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:45,708
You died in my kitchen, Alana,
when you chose to be brave.

258
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:50,833
Every moment since is borrowed.

259
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,916
Your wife.

260
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,708
Your child.

261
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,791
They belong to me.

262
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:05,833
You made a bargain for Will's life,
and then I spun you gold.

263
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,249
Hannibal has tentatively agreed
to the deal, as proposed.

264
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,708
What will it take to make him
less tentative?

265
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,374
He wants Will to ask him.

266
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,499
And he wants you to say "please".

267
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,708
I'll say "pretty please".

268
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:41,041
Well, people are going to stampede
if they think that Lecter is out.

269
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,666
Let them stampede.

270
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,583
Authenticity.

271
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:50,624
And let them believe
I helped Hannibal escape.

272
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,874
Authenticity?

273
00:26:57,084 --> 00:27:00,916
Someone has to be close
when the Dragon comes.

274
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,374
And then?

275
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,416
We kill Dolarhyde.

276
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,208
And then...

277
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:15,833
...we kill Hannibal.

278
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,666
To the Devil his due.

279
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,749
I thought you said
your goodbyes.

280
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,874
We've one last goodbye between us.

281
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,916
You didn't just say goodbye,
though, did you?

282
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:44,041
That little extra bit at the end...
What was that you said?

283
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,333
You'd never have turned yourself in
unless I rejected you.

284
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,833
Yes. That extra bit.

285
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,916
I believe that's what they call
a "mike-drop".

286
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,249
You dropped the mike, Will.

287
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,999
But here you are having to come back
and pick it up again.

288
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:08,333
I knew you'd keep running
if I kept chasing you.

289
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:14,916
I knew you wanted me to know exactly
where I could find you when I needed to.

290
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:16,833
And you did.

291
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,874
I need you, Hannibal.

292
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,958
Ding-dong, the Dragon's not dead.

293
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:32,541
He told you he wanted to meet you.
Maybe that was a serious invitation.

294
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,874
After the big escape,
you send a message to the Dragon

295
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,458
in the personal ads,
ask him for a rendezvous.

296
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,499
He won't go near a mail drop.

297
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,666
He might be curious enough
to look at one, see if you sold him.

298
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,958
We chose a drop that can be
watched only from a few places

299
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,374
from a long way off,

300
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,874
and we'll stake out
the observation points.

301
00:28:56,584 --> 00:29:00,458
It sounds weak to you,
even as you say it.

302
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:04,708
Secret Service has a set-up they've
never used. They'll let us have it.

303
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:10,249
You're our best shot, Hannibal.

304
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,541
Please.

305
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,083
He's not going to kill us here.

306
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:03,874
What he wants to do requires
something a little more private.

307
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,374
What are you doing?

308
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,208
You know, Will, you worry too much.

309
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:17,708
You'd be much more comfortable
if you relaxed with yourself.

310
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,666
Going my way?

311
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,916
The bluff is eroding.

312
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:02,999
There was more land
when I was here with Abigail.

313
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:07,374
More land still when I was here
with Miriam Lass.

314
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,583
And now you're here with me.

315
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:17,124
And the bluff is still eroding.

316
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,416
You and I are suspended
over the roiling Atlantic.

317
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,374
Soon, all this will be lost
to the sea.

318
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:53,624
You're playing games with yourself
in the dark of the moon.

319
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:59,624
It wasn't surprising that I heard
from the Great Red Dragon.

320
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,916
Was it surprising
when you heard from him?

321
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,458
Yes and no.

322
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:19,374
Do you intend to watch him kill me?

323
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,416
I intend to watch him change you.

324
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:34,291
My compassion for you
is inconvenient, Will.

325
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,541
If you're partial to beef products,

326
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:41,333
it is inconvenient to be
compassionate toward a cow.

327
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,708
Save yourself, kill them all?

328
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,916
I don't know if I can save myself.

329
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,666
And maybe that's just fine.

330
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:23,499
"No greater love hath man
than to lay down his life for a friend."

331
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,791
- He's watching us now.
- I know.

332
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,041
Don't run. I'll catch you.

333
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,208
Hello, Francis.

334
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,583
Hello, Dr Lecter.

335
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:21,458
I'm so happy you chose life, Francis.

336
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,124
Suicide is the enemy.

337
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,583
You were seized by a fantasy world...

338
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:42,666
...with the brilliance and freshness
and immediacy of childhood.

339
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,874
It took you a step beyond alone.

340
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,249
I'm going to film your death,
Dr Lecter.

341
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:03,083
As dying, you meld with the strength
of the Dragon.

342
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:10,208
It's a glorious and
rather discomforting idea.

343
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:16,916
Watching the film will be wonderful.

344
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:21,041
But not as wonderful
as the act itself.

See.
