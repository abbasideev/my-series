1
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:02,749
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:05,624
You won't be coming back here
for a long time.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,207
There's something reassuring
about you eating Dr Lecter.

4
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,457
It makes you the apex predator.

5
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,999
I am packing loads of viable sperm.

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,749
Stumbled across any viable uteruses?

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:16,957
Where is the polizia?

8
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,249
They're being bought by the same people
that bought Rinaldo Pazzi.

9
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,707
Is your husband still in the city?

10
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,124
Chiyoh has always been
very protective of me.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,915
I've taken the liberty of giving you
something to help you relax.

12
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,415
Jack was the first to suggest
getting inside your head.

13
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,832
No!

14
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,499
Sono un ufficiale del FBI.

15
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,332
Ascoltami.
Mi chiamo Jack Crawford.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,665
Sono un ufficiale del FBI.

17
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,665
Ascoltami. Ascoltami.

18
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,874
Ascoltami.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,749
Commendatore Benetti.

20
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,082
I don't imagine you're here
to make an arrest.

21
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,874
No. You imagine correctly.

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,582
Take Lecter and this one.
He'll pay us double for both.

23
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,749
There's no price on your head,
Signor Crawford.

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,290
So, Hannibal Lecter...
Il Mostro di Firenze,

25
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,624
narrowly escapes the Questura.

26
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,082
Is that how the story goes?

27
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,124
Missed him by this much.

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,499
The good Doctor Lecter
is once more in the wind.

29
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:25,207
But he left one last victim.

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,374
Open him the way Lecter
opened the other one.

31
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,624
Open him all the way.

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,582
Arrivederci.

33
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,790
Arrivederci.

34
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,165
Wrong floor.

35
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,249
Would you mind coming over here
and pulling this needle out of my neck?

36
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,249
Where did they take them?

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,582
Did you do this?

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,749
Of course.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,957
I appreciate it.

40
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,624
You're sitting at Hannibal's table.

41
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,332
You know him. You know Will.

42
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,332
I know them.

43
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,999
They are identically different,
Hannibal and Will.

44
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,790
Where did they take them?

45
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,915
They are most likely taking them
to the US, to Maryland.

46
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,707
I can even tell you the address,

47
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,415
once you've pulled this needle
out of my neck.

48
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,082
Then what?

49
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,999
My "then what" consists
of getting out of Florence alive,

50
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,874
since I'm supposed to be dead.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,165
Which puts me in no position to stop
whatever it is you intend on starting.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,665
Where?

53
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,957
Muskrat Farm, the Verger estate,

54
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,624
near the Susquehanna River
in northern Maryland.

55
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,915
Pronto.

56
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,540
Dimmi tutto.

57
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,999
Mason has what he wants.

58
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,582
I think it's time you get what you want.

59
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,624
He has Hannibal.

60
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,624
He has Will, too.

61
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,624
Your brother's a sadist.

62
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,374
He'll torture them
and take the time to enjoy it.

63
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,082
That gives us time.

64
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,957
There's a hush
over Muskrat Farm, Cordell.

65
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,124
Like the quiet of the old Sabbath.

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,540
Smells like salvation.

67
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:20,207
Gentlemen,
welcome to Muskrat Farm.

68
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,790
Your people might have assassinated me
in Florence, Mason.

69
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,415
Now where's the fun in that?

70
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,540
I still keep my father's knife,

71
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:37,540
ever ready to slip into a pig's back
to check the depth of the fat.

72
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,874
Cordell, if you would?

73
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,415
A little lean, I think.

74
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,957
Maybe we should fatten you up,
shall we?

75
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:13,415
It is more trouble to move
a semi-wild pig against its will

76
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,957
than it is to kidnap a man.

77
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:21,082
Pigs are harder to get hold of,
and big ones are stronger than a man.

78
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,499
There are the tusks to consider,

79
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,832
if you want to maintain
the integrity of your abdomen.

80
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,124
Something worth maintaining,
Mr Graham?

81
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,124
Tusked beasts instinctively disembowel.

82
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:45,207
At swine fairs, I've seen exotic pigs
from all over the world.

83
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:50,290
You are the best of all
that I've seen.

84
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:57,082
We are going to have
some good, funny times, Dr Lecter.

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,290
Sad news about Jack Crawford.

86
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,832
Appears Hannibal Lecter
killed him in Florence.

87
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:13,540
I hope there's some satisfaction in being
the final victim of the Chesapeake Ripper.

88
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,249
There'll certainly be some notoriety.

89
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,415
The faeces are flying again in Florence.

90
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,624
Jack Crawford is alive.

91
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,665
Well, that's disappointing.

92
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,207
He saw the snatch.

93
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:41,249
I trust you haven't betrayed
doctor-patient confidentiality, Dr Bloom.

94
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,790
Your trust hasn't been misplaced.

95
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:49,290
The FBI is going to catch
the first squeal on the kidnapping.

96
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,999
The moment Jack Crawford
set foot in Italy,

97
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,749
I registered complaints
with the local authorities,

98
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,207
the sheriff, the US Attorney's office,

99
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,415
that he'd been harassing me,

100
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,082
calling me late at night
with incoherent threats.

101
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,457
Of course he can't prove he didn't.

102
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,582
And it muddies the water.

103
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,332
Now you can head off a warrant.

104
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:18,415
There will be no warrant,
and there will be no warrant forthcoming.

105
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,999
I appreciate wanting to kill
Hannibal Lecter,

106
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,249
and I'm not without benefit from that.

107
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:32,415
He can't make good on his promise
to murder you if he's dead, now, can he?

108
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,415
But he's not dead.

109
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,124
Play with your food, Mason, and
you give it the opportunity to bite back.

110
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,790
Oh, I'm not playing, Dr Bloom.

111
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,999
Hannibal is.

112
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,624
He's always playing.

113
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,999
I snatched Will Graham
right out of your mouth.

114
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,332
You must be famished.

115
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,999
There is an inescapable parallel
between you and Jezebel, Mason.

116
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,124
Keen Bible student that you are,
you'll recall dogs ate Jezebel's face,

117
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,290
along with the rest of her.

118
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,124
If Jezebel was right
with the Risen Jesus,

119
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,124
the Riz would have provided her
with a new face,

120
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,999
as he has provided mine.

121
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,207
The transplant surgery
is extremely skilful,

122
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,665
which is why Cordell here
will be performing the face-off.

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,415
Hello.

124
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,082
You boys remind me of that German
cannibal who advertised for a friend,

125
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:10,749
and then ate him and his penis
before he died.

126
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,332
Tragedy being,
the penis was overcooked.

127
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:20,832
Go to all that trouble to eat a friend,
and you overcook his penis!

128
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,207
They ate it anyway.
They had to, they committed.

129
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,665
But they didn't enjoy it.

130
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,332
I'm committed to enjoying
every bite of you.

131
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:36,874
You're going to eat him
with my face?

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,957
Yes.

133
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,749
I got a taste for it
after you two had me eat my nose.

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,707
You must be terribly proud
that you could bring this off.

135
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,749
It's dangerous
to get exactly what you want.

136
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,540
What will you do
after you've eaten me?

137
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:59,457
You could wreck some foster homes
and torment some children.

138
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:04,332
Uh... or drink martinis
made with tears.

139
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,790
But where, Mason,
would the hard-core fun come from?

140
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,290
It's foolish to dilute
such an ecstatic time as this

141
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,874
with fears about the future.

142
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,124
Er, Cordell,
Mr Graham's looking very dry.

143
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,624
A little moisturiser, please.

144
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,457
I'm curious, what will be
the first cuts of me you'll serve?

145
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,999
The first course, of course,
will be your hands and feet.

146
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,790
Sizzling on a Promethean barbecue.

147
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,124
The coal is white and very hard,

148
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,457
it makes a clear ringing sound
when struck.

149
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,874
You've thought of everything.

150
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:52,624
And after that, we'll have
a little pyjama party, you and I.

151
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,749
You can be in shorties by then.

152
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,790
Cordell is going to keep you alive
for a very long time.

153
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,624
Well, no pyjama party for you,
Mr Graham.

154
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,874
We're gonna feed you to the pigs

155
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,957
as soon as Cordell
has removed your face

156
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:28,415
in a much more civilised fashion
than you just tried to remove his.

157
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,790
Mason would've preferred
to brand your face.

158
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:20,082
He fought bravely and with his own funds
against the Humane Slaughter Act,

159
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,624
and managed to keep
face-branding legal.

160
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,040
It's very important to Mason
that I have the pig's experience.

161
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,582
Mason has done beautiful things
with these creatures.

162
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,290
Very special.

163
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,582
Truly a visionary.

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,665
He has a wealth of information
and resources in his faceless skull.

165
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,957
The longer you're respectful,

166
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,665
the longer you'll keep your tongue.

167
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,415
And when I do lose my tongue?

168
00:15:56,166 --> 00:16:00,124
I'll boil it and slice it very thin,

169
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,749
marinate it in olive oil,
garlic, parsley and vinegar.

170
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,040
Simple and clean. And delicious.

171
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,290
Have they told you the drill?

172
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,624
The drill is, in a few hours,
I'll come down here

173
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,415
and remove all you've got
below the elbows and knees.

174
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:26,040
I'll keep you going with IVs
and tourniquets until the very last.

175
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,249
Some things are best saved for last.

176
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:36,374
Once you're dead,
I'll prepare your loins and ribs.

177
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,874
Aged.

178
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,957
Meats are aged not only for tenderness
but mainly for flavour.

179
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,915
And flavours change.

180
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,165
Every day I'll feed Mason
some new part of you.

181
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,290
Don't you worry, Dr Lecter.

182
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,540
You will always be cooked to perfection.

183
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:05,457
I think I might feed the eel
some delicacy of Lecter.

184
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,540
His genitals, perhaps.

185
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,124
How long have you and Dr Bloom
been an item?

186
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,332
Not long.

187
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,582
Longer than that, Cordell says.

188
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,415
Does Dr Bloom want children?

189
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,457
I'm sure you've had a chance
to check under the hood by now.

190
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,957
How's the uterus? Intact?

191
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,874
Are the hips childbearing? Roomy?

192
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,124
Land the plane, Mason.

193
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,915
Oh, you've got a big surprise
coming to you, Margot.

194
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,040
Would it spoil anything for you

195
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,457
if I told you I've already found us
a surrogate?

196
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,332
Not for my sperm, but for your eggs.

197
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,957
I don't have any. You took them.

198
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,082
I most certainly did,
but I didn't humpty-dumpty them.

199
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,415
I just went and found them
a new basket.

200
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:21,332
I told you I wanted to give you
a Verger baby, our own baby.

201
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,790
Yours and mine.

202
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,915
Well... mostly yours.

203
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,582
Where's the surrogate, Mason?

204
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,999
She's resting at the moment.

205
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,832
She's here?

206
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,790
She's on the farm.

207
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,332
I want to see her.

208
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,457
First, I think you need
to prepare yourself,

209
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,124
psychologically, I mean.

210
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,624
This is going to be a very emotional
experience for you, Margot.

211
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,624
I have to think about appropriate timing.

212
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,040
Don't think too long, smiley.

213
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,332
Oh, that's the spirit, Margot.

214
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:33,374
Your maternal instinct's revving up.
I love it.

215
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,290
What are you doing here?

216
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,082
I'm Mason Verger's psychiatrist.

217
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,790
Is that part of his therapy or yours?

218
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,082
I think we're all working
through some issues.

219
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,415
I'm putting an emphasis
on self-preservation.

220
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,290
Jack's alive.

221
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,457
Good for Jack.

222
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,207
You helped Mason Verger find us.

223
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,082
I helped Mason find Hannibal.

224
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:36,082
We followed Bâtard-Montrachet
when we should've just followed you.

225
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,457
Almost as ugly as
what Mason wants to do to us

226
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,124
is the fact that he can do it

227
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,124
with the tacit agreement
of people sworn to uphold the law.

228
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,624
I was trying to get to Hannibal
before you.

229
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,457
I knew you couldn't stop yourself,
so I had to try.

230
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,249
By facilitating torture and death?

231
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,249
I can abide the thought
of Hannibal tortured.

232
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,790
Not necessarily to death.

233
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,207
I'd say he has it coming,
wouldn't you?

234
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,415
Or maybe you wouldn't.

235
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,374
What did you think would happen?

236
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,415
I thought Jack Crawford and the FBI
would come to the rescue.

237
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,832
But the finer details of what I thought
would happen have evolved.

238
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,790
Then you have to evolve, Alana.

239
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,415
You have to spill blood.

240
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,999
Either by your own hand or...

241
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,374
...someone else's.

242
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,332
Buonasera, signor.

243
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,540
Buonasera, Signorina Verger.

244
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,874
Thank you for coming, Margot.

245
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,082
It hasn't been that long
since I treated you.

246
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,915
Have you started taking the chocolate,
as Mason likes to say...

247
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,457
...after you fought him for so long?

248
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,415
Are we in therapy now?

249
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,207
You tell me.

250
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,624
Mason promised
to give something back to me.

251
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,415
Something that he stole.

252
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,207
There was a surrogate all along.

253
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,582
It's a Verger baby.

254
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,374
It's my baby.

255
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,207
Mason will deny you.

256
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,415
He will always deny you.

257
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,082
You know you will have to kill him.

258
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,749
Are you saying you'd do it for me?

259
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,457
I could never trust you.

260
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,624
No, of course not.

261
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,457
But you could trust me
never to deny that I did it.

262
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,832
It would actually be more therapeutic
for you to kill him yourself.

263
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,332
You'll remember
I recommended that in session.

264
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,665
Wait until I could get away with it,
you said.

265
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,665
What difference would one more
murder charge make to me?

266
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:11,082
I'm the only other suspect you've got.

267
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,290
You can do it when it suits you,

268
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,999
and I'll write a letter gloating about
how much I enjoyed killing him myself.

269
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,749
Buonasera.

270
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,374
He has a pocketknife.

271
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,124
I was trying to save Will from you.

272
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,790
But right now, you're the only one
who can save him.

273
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,832
Promise me you'll save him.

274
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,749
Please.

275
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,582
I promise.

276
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,124
And I always keep my promises, Alana.

277
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:44,040
Just cut the ropes on one arm,
give me the knife and leave.

278
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,874
I can do the rest.

279
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,749
Are you going to kill Mason?

280
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,124
Margot is.

281
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:17,124
Snatch some of my hair,
back from the hairline, if you don't mind.

282
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,082
Get some skin.

283
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,999
Put it in Mason's hand after he's dead.

284
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,999
Could I have ever understood you?

285
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,582
No.

286
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,499
Ah... Cordell told me
if I waited long enough,

287
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:29,124
he could grow me a new face
from my own cells.

288
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,457
But I was adamant
it was your face I wanted.

289
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:37,207
I was looking at your face
while you were watching me cut mine off

290
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,874
and I thought,
"Oh, that's a nice face."

291
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,207
You're going under now,
Mr Verger.

292
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,624
When you wake up, your face
will be bound and uncomfortable.

293
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,207
Have you accepted Jesus,
Mr Graham?

294
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,124
Do you have faith?

295
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,749
I do. I'm free.

296
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,832
Hallelujah.

297
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:20,332
This will immobilise your body,

298
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:24,124
but you'll feel everything.

299
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,415
I'm going to cut off your face
without anaesthesia, Mr Graham.

300
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,165
Is he alive?

301
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,832
There's no foetal heartbeat.

302
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,540
Take it out.

303
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,415
Take it out!

304
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:12,165
You'll be sure to let me know
if this hurts, won't you?

305
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,582
Cordell?

306
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,457
Cordell?

307
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,374
Cordell!

308
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,832
Cordell!

309
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,624
Cordell!

310
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,749
Hi, Mason.

311
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,332
What the hell's going on out there?
Where's Cordell?

312
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,540
Cordell's dead.

313
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,749
They're all dead out there.

314
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,415
Hannibal got away.

315
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,290
Well, get on the horn to Washington

316
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:45,624
and get four of those bastards
with guns up here now!

317
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,749
Send the helicopter.

318
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,957
I found your surrogate, Mason.

319
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,915
Your surrogate, Margot.

320
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:02,332
I promised you
I'd give you a Verger baby.

321
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:07,374
I'm taking what you promised me.

322
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:12,624
And I've got everything I need
from you now.

323
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,040
You can't kill me, Margot.

324
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,915
You'll lose everything.

325
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,457
"In the absence of an heir,

326
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:29,082
"the sole beneficiary is
the Southern Baptist Church."

327
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,832
But there is going to be
an heir, Mason.

328
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,540
A Verger baby.

329
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,040
Yours, mine...

330
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,999
Mostly yours.

331
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:46,249
You know what happens if we stimulate
your prostate gland with a cattle prod?

332
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,374
Hannibal does.
He helped us milk you.

333
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,957
You're dead, Dr Bloom.

334
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,082
No, Mason.

335
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,582
We all are. Didn't you know that?

336
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,540
But these aren't.

337
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,332
Will you go home?

338
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,790
Can you go home?

339
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,665
No more than you can.

340
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,540
- Would you watch over me?
- I will.

341
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,540
Not in a cage.

342
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,999
Some beasts shouldn't be caged.

343
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,790
Your obsessive and successful hunt,

344
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:43,082
whose plight was it driven by? Mine?

345
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,624
Yours?

346
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,749
Mischa's.

347
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,790
Did you eat her?

348
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,207
Yes.

349
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,374
But I did not kill her.

350
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:11,082
The most stable elements, Chiyoh,
appear in the middle of the periodic table,

351
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,582
roughly between iron and silver.

352
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,749
Between iron and silver.

353
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,749
I think that's appropriate for you.

354
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:33,540
Do we talk about teacups and time
and the rules of disorder?

355
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:38,207
The teacup's broken.

356
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,915
It's never going to gather itself
back together again.

357
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,874
Not even in your mind?

358
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,249
Your memory palace is building.
It's full of new things.

359
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:03,624
It shares some rooms with my own.

360
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,499
I've discovered you there.

361
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,957
Victorious.

362
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,874
When it comes to you and me...

363
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,915
...there can be no decisive victory.

364
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,415
We are in zero-sum game?

365
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,040
I miss my dogs.

366
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,874
I'm not gonna miss you.

367
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,415
I'm not going to find you.

368
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,165
I'm not going to look for you.

369
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,915
I don't want to know
where you are or what you do.

370
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,624
I don't want to think about you anymore.

371
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,124
You delight in wickedness
and then berate yourself for the delight.

372
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,415
You delight.

373
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,582
I tolerate.

374
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,999
I don't have your appetite.

375
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,415
Goodbye... Hannibal.

376
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,124
He's gone, Jack.

377
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,165
Jack.

378
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,749
I'm here.

379
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:22,249
You finally caught
the Chesapeake Ripper, Jack.

380
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,415
I didn't catch you.

381
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,665
You surrendered.

382
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,832
I want you to know exactly where I am.
And where you can always find me.

383
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,832
Cuff him. Put him in my car.
