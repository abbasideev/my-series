1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,915
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,165
I've killed hardly anybody
during our residence.

3
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:07,415
What are you doing in Florence?
Are you working with Roman?

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,957
Roman is speaking to the Studiolo Friday.
You should come.

5
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,165
What wickedness has your attention,
Mr Dimmond?

6
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,957
Yours... "Dr Fell".

7
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,749
Are you here to twist me
into an uncomfortable position?

8
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,249
I'm here to help you untwist.

9
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,165
Snails prefer eating
with company.

10
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,957
If only that company
could be Will Graham.

11
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,957
Is Will Graham still alive?

12
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,707
Will was not a suitable
substitute for therapy.

13
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:30,999
What have you done,
Hannibal?

14
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,874
Abigail...

15
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,374
I didn't know what else to do, so...

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,415
I just did what he told me.

17
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,957
Where is he?

18
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,540
You were supposed to leave.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,040
We couldn't leave without you.

20
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,249
Time did reverse.

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,165
The teacup that I shattered
dared to come together.

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,874
A place was made for Abigail
in your world.

23
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,332
Do you understand?

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,415
That place was made for all of us.

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,707
Together.

26
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,082
I wanted to surprise you.

27
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,790
And you...

28
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,874
You wanted to surprise me.

29
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,499
I let you know me.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
See me.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,749
I gave you a rare gift.

32
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,499
But you didn't want it.

33
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,249
Didn't I?

34
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,457
- You would deny me my life.
- No... no.

35
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,374
Not your life, no.

36
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,540
My freedom, then.
You would take that from me.

37
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,957
Confine me to a prison cell.

38
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:06,249
Do you believe you could change me
the way I've changed you?

39
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,957
I already did.

40
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,499
Fate and circumstance have
returned us to this moment...

41
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,874
when the teacup shatters.

42
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,207
I forgive you, Will.

43
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,957
Will you forgive me?

44
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,540
Don't...

45
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,499
Don't...

46
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,915
No, no...

47
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,832
No!

48
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,040
You can make it all go away.

49
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,040
Put your head back.

50
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,915
Close your eyes.

51
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,499
Wade into the quiet of the stream.

52
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,665
How do you feel?

53
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,707
Thirsty.

54
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,707
There's someone here
very anxious to see you.

55
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,749
They told me he knew exactly
how to cut me.

56
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,457
They said it was surgical.

57
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,624
He wanted us to live.

58
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,915
He left us to die.

59
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,332
But we didn't.

60
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,165
He was supposed to take me with him.

61
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,540
We were all supposed to leave together.

62
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,457
He made a place for us.

63
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,999
- Abigail...
- Why did you lie to him?

64
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,957
The wrong thing being
the right thing to do was...

65
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,374
was too ugly a thought.

66
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,540
He gave you a chance to take it all back,
and you just kept lying.

67
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,707
No one had to die.

68
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:20,374
It's hard to grasp
what would've happened,

69
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,582
or could've happened,

70
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,290
in some other world did happen.

71
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,582
I'm having a hard enough time
dealing with this world.

72
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:36,207
Hope some of the other worlds
are easier on me.

73
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,332
Everything that can happen happens.

74
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,540
It has to end well.

75
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,499
And it has to end badly.

76
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,124
It has to end every way it can.

77
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,499
This is the way it ended for us.

78
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,749
We don't have an ending.

79
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,790
He didn't give us one yet.

80
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,707
He wants us to find him.

81
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,290
After everything he's done,
you'd still go to him?

82
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,290
If everything that can happen happens,

83
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,457
then you can never really do
the wrong thing.

84
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,874
You're just doing
what you're supposed to.

85
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,457
When we've gone from this life,

86
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,749
I will always have this place.

87
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,749
In your "memory palace".

88
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,249
My palace is vast,
even by medieval standards.

89
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,707
The foyer is the Norman Chapel
in Palermo.

90
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,665
Severe and beautiful and timeless.

91
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,082
With a single reminder of mortality:

92
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,749
a skull graven in the floor.

93
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,582
Even in an enlightened world,
we come here to feel closer to God.

94
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,749
Do you feel closer to God?

95
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,999
God's not who I came here to find.

96
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,457
Do you believe in God?

97
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,082
What I believe is closer to science fiction
than anything in the Bible.

98
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,207
We all know it,
but nobody ever says that G-dash-D

99
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,915
won't do a G-dash-D-damned thing
to answer anybody's prayers.

100
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:49,832
God can't save any of us
because it's inelegant.

101
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,082
Elegance is more important
than suffering.

102
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,332
That's his design.

103
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,665
Are you talking about God or Hannibal?

104
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,957
Hannibal's not God.

105
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,290
He wouldn't have any fun being God.

106
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,957
Defying God,
now that's his idea of a good time.

107
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:31,040
Nothing would thrill Hannibal more
than to see this roof collapse

108
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,290
mid-Mass, packed pews,
choir singing.

109
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,374
He would just love it.

110
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,874
And he thinks God would love it too.

111
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,915
Is it him?

112
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,665
Per favore, signore.

113
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,999
È proibito qui.
La cappella è chiusa.

114
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,790
La Manna, non lasciarlo uscire.
Voglio parlare con lui.

115
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,290
What did he say?

116
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,332
He said,
he wants to talk to you.

117
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,915
Signor Graham...

118
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,957
Chief Investigator Rinaldo Pazzi,
Questura di Firenze.

119
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,790
You're a long way from Florence.

120
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,999
You're a long way from Baltimore.

121
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,999
I read everything I can find
on FBI profiling methods.

122
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,249
I've read all about your incarceration.

123
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,874
Keep reading. I was acquitted.

124
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:28,582
You come to Palermo
and soon, very soon,

125
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,290
a body is discovered.

126
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,999
The priest at the Cappella
dei Normanni said

127
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,040
you have been spending
a lot of time there.

128
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,749
I've been praying.

129
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,290
There is some comfort in prayer.

130
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:52,374
It leaves you with the distinct feeling
you're not alone.

131
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,832
Signore...

132
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,624
Vieni con me.

133
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,332
Ciao.

134
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,832
Is Will Graham here
because of the body at the cappella,

135
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,874
or is the body here
because of Will Graham?

136
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,957
Why are you here?

137
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,874
I'm like you.

138
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,499
I do what you do.

139
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,249
We share the gift of imagination.

140
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,707
I've got the scars of a man
who grabbed his gift by the blade.

141
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,374
You grabbed the wrong end.

142
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,207
Those moments
when the connection is made,

143
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,707
that is my keenest pleasure.

144
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,124
- Knowing.
- Knowing.

145
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,540
Not feeling, not thinking.

146
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,874
You know who murdered that man
and left him in the Cappella Palatina.

147
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,415
Don't you know?

148
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,957
I met him twenty years ago.

149
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,457
Il Mostro,

150
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,540
the Monster of Florence.

151
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,540
It was his custom to arrange his victims
like a beautiful painting.

152
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:48,415
Il Mostro created images
that stayed in my mind.

153
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,165
Twenty years ago,

154
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,915
I was dwelling on a couple found slain

155
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,707
in the bed of a pickup truck
in Impruneta.

156
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,665
Bodies placed,
garlanded with flowers...

157
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,582
Like a Botticelli.

158
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,040
Exactly like a Botticelli.

159
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,665
His painting "Primavera" still hangs
in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence,

160
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,874
just as it did twenty years ago.

161
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,957
The garlanded nymph on the right,

162
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,957
flowers streaming from her mouth,

163
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,665
match... match...

164
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,915
The Uffizi Gallery...

165
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,082
That's where you met Il Mostro.

166
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,749
That's where I met...

167
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,874
...this man.

168
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,207
The Monster of Florence.

169
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,790
Success comes
as a result of inspiration.

170
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,790
Revelation is the development
of an image,

171
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,707
first blurred, then coming clear.

172
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:23,415
To find the inspiration
Il Mostro used was a triumph.

173
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:29,207
I went to the Uffizi and stood before
the original "Primavera" day after day,

174
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:34,332
and most days I'd see
a young Lithuanian man

175
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:38,457
as transfixed by the Botticelli
as I was.

176
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:44,124
As transfixed as I imagined
Il Mostro would be.

177
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,957
And every day I saw him,

178
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,582
he would recreate
the "Primavera" in pencil,

179
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,957
just as he did in flesh.

180
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,707
I knew.

181
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,874
It was the best moment of my life.

182
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,624
A moment of epiphany
that made me famous

183
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,832
and then ruined me.

184
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,040
In the haste and the heat of ambition,

185
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,499
the Questura nearly destroyed
the young man's home,

186
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,082
trying to find evidence.

187
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,790
- He doesn't leave evidence.
- No, he doesn't.

188
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,540
He eats it.

189
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,124
Another man,

190
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,624
not an innocent man,
but innocent of those crimes,

191
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,457
was a dream suspect.

192
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:38,457
He was convicted on no evidence
except his character.

193
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:43,415
Blame has a habit of not sticking
to Hannibal Lecter.

194
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:52,082
It has a habit of sticking to you.

195
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,540
I splintered every bone,

196
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:54,124
fractured them... dynamically.

197
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,874
Made you malleable.

198
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,374
I skinned you.

199
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,040
Bent you.

200
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,874
Twisted you.

201
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,499
And trimmed you.

202
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,790
Head, hands, arms, and legs.

203
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,415
A topiary.

204
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,332
This is my design.

205
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:51,124
A valentine written on a broken man.

206
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,874
Will...

207
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:29,290
I do feel closer to Hannibal here.

208
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,582
God only knows
where I'd be without him.

209
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,790
He left us his...

210
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,249
his broken heart.

211
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,624
How did he know we were here?

212
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,290
He didn't.

213
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,999
But he knew we would come.

214
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,665
He misses us.

215
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,040
Hannibal follows
several trains of thought at once

216
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:16,165
without distraction from any.

217
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,415
And one of the trains...

218
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,915
...is always for his own amusement.

219
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,082
He's playing with us.

220
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,207
Always.

221
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,707
You still want to go with him?

222
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,415
Yes.

223
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,749
He gave you back to me.

224
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,457
Then he took you away.

225
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,540
It's Lucy and the football.
He just keeps pulling you away.

226
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,499
What if no one died?
What if...

227
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,665
What if we all left together?

228
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,832
Like we were supposed to.

229
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,707
After he served the lamb.

230
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,207
Where would we have gone?

231
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,665
In some other world?

232
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,165
In some other world.

233
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,249
He said he made a place for us.

234
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,415
A place was made for you, Abigail.

235
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,665
In this world.

236
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:07,332
It was the only place
I could make for you.

237
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,249
Are you praying?

238
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,249
Hannibal doesn't pray.

239
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,832
But he believes in God.

240
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,915
Intimately.

241
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:41,582
I wasn't asking Hannibal Lecter.

242
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,457
I think my prayers would feel
constricted by the saints

243
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,915
and the apostles

244
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,749
and Jesus Pantocrator.

245
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,332
How do your prayers feel?

246
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:12,082
I hope my prayers escaped,

247
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:16,457
flown from here
to the open sky and God.

248
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,707
Praying you catch him?

249
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,957
You should be praying
he doesn't capture you.

250
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,915
I didn't head the Questura di Firenze
for nothing.

251
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,207
You couldn't catch him
when he was just a kid,

252
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,040
what makes you think
you're going to catch him now?

253
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,332
You.

254
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,040
What makes you think
I want to catch him?

255
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,082
Signor Graham...

256
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,499
Sei ancora qui signor Graham,
con me?

257
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,290
Dove sei?

258
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:10,124
If you could possibly be content,

259
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,332
I would suggest you let Il Mostro go.

260
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,999
I can't do that
any more than you can.

261
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,082
He's going to kill you, you know.

262
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,749
I'm usually right about these things.

263
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:31,582
He let you know him.
He sent you his heart.

264
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,374
Where has he gone now?

265
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,415
He hasn't gone anywhere.

266
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,957
He's still here.

267
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,415
Hannibal.

268
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,665
Signor Graham...

269
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:43,332
You shouldn't be down here alone.

270
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,582
I'm not alone. I'm with you.

271
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,957
You don't know whose side I'm on.

272
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,290
What are you going to do
when you find him?

273
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,540
Your Il Mostro?

274
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,707
I'm curious about that myself.

275
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:26,249
You and I carry the dead with us,
Signor Graham.

276
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,707
We both need to unburden.

277
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:35,457
Why don't you carry your dead
back to the chapel

278
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,707
before you count yourself
among them?

279
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:48,207
You are already dead, aren't you?

280
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,624
Buonanotte, commendatore.

281
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,457
Hannibal...

282
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,457
I forgive you.
