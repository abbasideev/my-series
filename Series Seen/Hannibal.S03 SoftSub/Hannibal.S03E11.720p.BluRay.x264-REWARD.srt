1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,790
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:05,915
You're full of surprises, D.
I find you very mysterious.

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,249
I am delighted that
you have taken an interest in me.

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:13,290
- I want to be recognised by you.
- See how magnificent you are.

5
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,624
The man who killed
the Jacobis and the Leedses chose them.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,749
I have to believe
there is a common factor.

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,624
Are you familiar with William Blake's
"The Great Red Dragon"?

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,207
You're the second person
who's asked to see the Blake today.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,624
As the dragon grows
in strength and glory,

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,290
there are families to come.

11
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,332
So whatever he says he wants to do,
you'll take him anyway.

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,457
I promise I'll try to make it
as easy on him as I can.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,749
- He ate a painting.
- He ate it?

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,749
He ate it up.

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:55,040
The Art Squad in New York snapped to it
when they found out what he ate.

16
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,207
They pulled two partial prints
from the plastic pass he used.

17
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,749
No ID, but it's still the same thumb
that was on Mrs Leeds' eye.

18
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,790
What about the docent at the museum?

19
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:09,082
He had a sweet touch with her.
She had to have four stitches.

20
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:13,332
- Mild concussion, but he didn't kill her.
- Why?

21
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:17,457
He'd have been better off killing her.
And you.

22
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,832
Maybe he's trying to stop.

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,957
You think there's a way to push him
to being self-destructive?

24
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:29,999
- You mean push him toward suicide?
- Suicide suits me just fine.

25
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:34,082
If he's really trying to stop,
he's not going to kill himself.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,665
How could he be sure his death
would affect whatever's inside him?

27
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:43,207
You must know something about him
otherwise you wouldn't have found him.

28
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,082
Jack Crawford...

29
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:56,082
...fisher of men, watching my cork
move against the current.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,415
You got me again.

31
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,957
Hannibal told me where to find him.

32
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,040
He knows.

33
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,957
He knows who the Dragon is.

34
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,207
He probably treated him.

35
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,707
It stunned me the first time I saw it.

36
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,624
Like Blake peeked in your ear
and saw the Red Dragon there.

37
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,749
Coiled inside you. Coiled around you.

38
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,582
This new two-ness with the Dragon,
it's disorienting for you.

39
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,332
Our wills were one.

40
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,749
But not now.

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,999
Not since her.

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:10,457
The Dragon has never
spoken to me before.

43
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,915
It was frightening.

44
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,457
What did it say?

45
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,957
It called my name.

46
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,915
It wants her.

47
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:33,457
If it weren't for the power
of your Becoming,

48
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:38,124
if it weren't for the Dragon,
you could never have had her.

49
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,957
I put my hand...

50
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,082
...on her beating heart.

51
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:55,332
Heard the sound of her living voice.

52
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:03,874
A...living...woman.

53
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,624
How bizarre.

54
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:20,665
I don't want to give her to the Dragon.

55
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,332
The Dragon is in your belly now.

56
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,457
'You can choose to have her alive.'

57
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,249
You don't have to worry
about feeling love for her.

58
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,249
You can always toss the Dragon
to someone else.

59
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,207
Will Graham...

60
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,249
...interests me.

61
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,415
Odd-looking for an investigator.

62
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,124
Not very handsome, but purposeful.

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,665
He has a family.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,915
Save yourself.

65
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,040
Kill them all.

66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,249
I have a little homework.

67
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,957
Sure.

68
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,249
If I'm keeping you from working,
I can go.

69
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,957
No.

70
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,915
I want you to be here.

71
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,124
I do.

72
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:02,582
I have some film
that I need to check.

73
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,207
It won't take long.

74
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,749
Hmm. Does it have a soundtrack?

75
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,124
No.

76
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,415
May I keep the music?

77
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,874
Uh-huh.

78
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:24,124
I think I'll just stretch out here
for a few minutes, if you don't mind.

79
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,124
No, don't move.

80
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,790
I have plenty of room.

81
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,040
Wake me up if I drop off.

82
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,207
Are these your nocturnal animals?

83
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,749
Uh-huh.

84
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,124
Think they know they're being filmed?

85
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,082
No.

86
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,499
- Mum! Mum!
- What?

87
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,082
Something's wrong with the dogs.

88
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,665
They may have got into something
they shouldn't have.

89
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:07,082
Has there been any changes in their diet?

90
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,790
My husband usually
makes their food from scratch.

91
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,124
But he's out of town
and it's a lot of work,

92
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,540
so I've been feeding them
canned food.

93
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,790
- Was that canned food made in China?
- Is it bad to be made in China?

94
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,415
If you're pet food. Dogs get poisoned
by Chinese pet food all the time.

95
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,457
- Are the dogs going to die?
- No, they're not gonna...

96
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,415
- Are the dogs gonna die?
- No, you got them here really fast.

97
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,624
The activated charcoal should
soak up whatever's in their system.

98
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,082
Bring a sample of what they've been
eating, so we can run some tests.

99
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,999
I'll bring it by tomorrow.

100
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,832
In the meantime, we'll keep the dogs here
overnight and monitor their recovery.

101
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,540
- They should be fine.
- Thank you.

102
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,415
Are you going to tell Dad?

103
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:02,290
Erm, you know how I always said
that secrets were bad

104
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,665
and you shouldn't keep secrets?

105
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,915
I have an amendment to that,

106
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,624
and we're going to keep
this secret for now.

107
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,832
Just you and me.

108
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,124
You want me to lie?

109
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,082
It's not a lie,
if you keep your mouth shut.

110
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,082
Your dad has enough to worry about

111
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,832
without worrying if I'm going
to poison the dogs again.

112
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,790
I'm not fortune's fool.

113
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,999
I'm yours.

114
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,790
"Behold the Great Red Dragon."

115
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,332
And did you?

116
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,915
The Brooklyn Museum is closed
to the public on Tuesdays,

117
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,915
and researchers are admitted.

118
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,749
You knew that's when
we'd both be going.

119
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,040
A sophisticated intelligence
can forecast many things.

120
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,040
I suppose mine is
sophisticated enough.

121
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,082
He's contacted you.

122
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,540
How do you imagine
he's contacted me?

123
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,374
Personal ads?

124
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,832
Writing notes of admiration
on toilet paper?

125
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,749
There is a family out there
who don't know he's coming.

126
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,415
We can save them.

127
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,915
Tell me who he is.

128
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,249
I don't know who he is.

129
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:47,290
When you close your eyes, Will,
is it your family you see?

130
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,457
No...

131
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,957
How's he choosing them?

132
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,540
Social media, I imagine.

133
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,249
Can't be too careful
with privacy settings.

134
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,207
Do you know who they are?

135
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,665
Yes.

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,665
And you're willing to let them die.

137
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,207
They're not my family, Will.

138
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,915
And I'm not letting them die.
You are.

139
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:01,124
Wait for me by the car.
Count to a hundred.

140
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,915
If you see anyone else but me,
run for the road.

141
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,040
Forty-four...

142
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,124
Wait here. Stop!

143
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,165
Mum!

144
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,249
Come on, quick!

145
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,124
- I almost killed you! What are you doing?
- Stay down! Get back in the car.

146
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,749
Your mum's in surgery now.

147
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,290
Is there anything else I need
to know to see about Mum?

148
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,749
You're both safe here.

149
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,040
This crazy guy wants to kill you?

150
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,457
No...

151
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,915
Well, we don't know what he wants.

152
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,582
Are you gonna kill him?

153
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,249
No.

154
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,790
I'm gonna catch him.

155
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,624
They'll put him in a mental hospital,

156
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,749
so they can treat him and keep him
from hurting anybody else.

157
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,082
Tommy's mum had this little newspaper.

158
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,999
It said you killed a guy and
you were put in a mental hospital.

159
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,790
Is it true?

160
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,040
Yes, yes.

161
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:33,165
It bothers you, finding that out?

162
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,790
Because I married your mum?

163
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,790
Then you shouldn't put this guy
in a mental hospital, you should kill him.

164
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,999
I want to watch baseball.

165
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,332
His team playing?

166
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,124
He read about me
in a Freddie Lounds article.

167
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,624
I had to justify myself
to an eleven-year-old.

168
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,124
Resentment's raising
a blister in you, Will.

169
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,415
You think you might lose me
after this, Jack?

170
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,707
You think I might go back
to my family?

171
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,124
- For a minute, I did.
- Right...

172
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,207
Then you realised what I realised,
which is I can't go home.

173
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,915
And neither can Molly and Walter,

174
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,749
not until the Red Dragon is
out of the way.

175
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,749
Sorry to interrupt.
You have a telephone call.

176
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,915
It's your lawyer.
Would you like to take it?

177
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,415
Did he say why he was calling?

178
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,207
I called him.

179
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,790
To confirm that he hasn't called you.

180
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,165
Not since you've been declared insane.

181
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,040
I could have told you that.

182
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,957
- If only I'd known to ask.
- If only.

183
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,707
Would you have told me the truth?

184
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,540
In my own way, I always have.

185
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:12,874
Mr Metcalf, that'll be all for now.
Thank you for your time.

186
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,332
You've been talking
to the Tooth Fairy.

187
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,124
I think he's earned the right to be
known by the name he's chosen.

188
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,749
He's the Great Red Dragon.

189
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,290
You have hubbed hell, Dr Lecter.

190
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,040
I often do.

191
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,915
You got what you wanted.

192
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,999
Suddenly, you're very relevant.

193
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,040
There is one way
for you to stay relevant...

194
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,624
...and comfortable.

195
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,540
You want me to speak with the Dragon.

196
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,415
Given his recent failure,
you believe he will seek counsel.

197
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,957
We need to make
your contact work for us.

198
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,624
Standing trace order
for any time you're on the phone.

199
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,332
When he calls,
you keep him on the line.

200
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,624
I can't refuse him a sympathetic ear.

201
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,040
He no doubt needs it.

202
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,582
Don't do that.

203
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,082
Don't do that.

204
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,457
D?

205
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,415
D?

206
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,124
You in here?

207
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:50,665
Yes.

208
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:54,749
What are you doing
sitting here in the dark?

209
00:27:55,541 --> 00:28:00,249
- How do you know it's dark?
- The lights aren't on.

210
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,832
Do you remember it?

211
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,082
The light?

212
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:14,249
Is it worse to have seen it
and lost it?

213
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,415
I know I can never have the light,

214
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,999
but there are things I can have.

215
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,082
There are things to enjoy.

216
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,207
You sound strange.

217
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,249
Reba...

218
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,499
I don't know what to say to you.

219
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:41,582
I don't know what's happening to me...
with you.

220
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:47,249
You threaten me and
yet you do not threaten me.

221
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,457
It's confusing.

222
00:28:55,666 --> 00:29:00,999
It's OK to be confused.
We spend most of our lives confused.

223
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,749
It's rare to really figure anything out.

224
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,999
I can't be with you.

225
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:39,165
Most men are terrified
of entailing a burden.

226
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,999
That fear is amplified in my case.

227
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:51,415
That's not why I'm afraid.

228
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,457
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

229
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,457
It was nice to spend time
with someone

230
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,124
who has the courage to get his hat

231
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,624
or stay as he damn pleased,

232
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,124
and gives me credit for the same.

233
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,915
Get your hat, Francis.

234
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,457
Get it and go.

235
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,624
Hello?

236
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:52,124
'You are the Dragon,
you don't have to be afraid.

237
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,999
'You know who speaks.

238
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,915
'From the beginning,
you and the Dragon had been one.

239
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,290
'You are becoming.'

240
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:07,749
And the Dragon is your higher self.

241
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:16,624
If I'm not as strong as the Dragon,

242
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,749
she will die.

243
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,082
Don't let fear leach your strength.

244
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,749
I need to think.

245
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,165
I need to think.

246
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:39,207
I told her I can't be with her.

247
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:46,749
You are almost blind
to your own true feelings,

248
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,832
no more able to express them
than a scar can blush.

249
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,749
Do you know how you feel about her?

250
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,915
Yes.

251
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,749
I...

252
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:08,165
I'm afraid she will come
to the house to talk.

253
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:14,332
I don't know what will happen
in the house.

254
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,665
The Dragon may come down.

255
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,040
I know how easily she would tear.

256
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,457
I think about what the...

257
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,832
She called me a man.

258
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,415
A sweet man.

259
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:14,749
I didn't hear Reba's heart.

260
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,082
They are listening.

261
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,082
The Tooth Fairy used
call-spoofing software,

262
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,124
piggybacking on Lecter's old line,

263
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,207
but the caller ID showed
his lawyer's number.

264
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,332
Hannibal's having his fun.

265
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,790
You're not the only one
who keeps their promises, Hannibal.

266
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,040
The toilet, too.

267
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,124
Wally's safe.

268
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,540
The dogs are safe.

269
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,040
We're picking them up
and bringing them in.

270
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,457
You look different.

271
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,915
You said you wouldn't be the same
when you came home.

272
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,499
- And you said you would.
- Hmm.

273
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,040
Boy, was I wrong about that.

274
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,665
I wanted you to go.

275
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,457
I told you to go.

276
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,624
Nobody to blame but myself.

277
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,290
And Jack Crawford.

278
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,915
I do blame Jack Crawford.

279
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,582
Jack knew what he was doing.

280
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,207
And so did I.

281
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,915
Is he after you now?

282
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,624
Is that why he came after us?

283
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,624
He came after you
because Hannibal suggested it.

284
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,457
He urged him to do it.

285
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:53,249
That's a clammy, sick feeling.

286
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,249
Yeah, I know it is.

287
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,582
Wally almost died.

288
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:10,082
My son almost died, I almost died.

289
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:15,082
I knew it was him. I knew it was him.

290
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:19,749
I saw your picture in that paper
and I knew it was him.

291
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,249
Hell, I got mad there for a second.

292
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,082
I hate this, Molly.

293
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,040
I'm sorry.

294
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,624
Erm...

295
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,082
This could take a while.

296
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,082
It might.

297
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,832
We'll be back home...

298
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,415
...won't we?

299
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,540
Yep.

300
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,249
It's tough to hold onto anything good.

301
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,207
It's all so slippery.

302
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:40,665
Yeah, slick as hell.

303
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,790
I'm just about worn out
with you crazy sons of bitches.

304
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,290
The essence of the worst
in the human spirit

305
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,957
is not found
in the crazy sons of bitches.

306
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,582
Ugliness is found
in the faces of the crowd.

307
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,582
What did you say to him?

308
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:33,165
"Save yourself. Kill them all."
Then I gave him your home address.

309
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,415
How's the wife?

310
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,415
How's my wife?

311
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,374
She's lucky.

312
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:54,957
She survived the Great Red Dragon.
That takes a pinch more than luck.

313
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,832
When you look at her now,
what do you see?

314
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,749
You know what I see.

315
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,874
Before he became the Red Dragon,

316
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,457
this shy boy would never
have dared any of this.

317
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:18,415
Well, now he thinks
he can do anything. Anything.

318
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,540
Anything.

319
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:28,415
The Dragon likely thinks you are
as much a monster as you think he is.

320
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:32,915
Is this a competition?

321
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:38,624
"Two souls, alas,
are dwelling in my breast,

322
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,749
"and one is striving
to forsake its brother."

323
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:48,207
The Great Red Dragon
is freedom to him,

324
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,624
shedding his skin,

325
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,624
the sound of his voice,

326
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,582
his own reflection.

327
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,082
The building of a new body
and the othering of himself,

328
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:06,249
the splitting of his personality,
all seem active and deliberate.

329
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,540
He craves change.

330
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,582
He didn't murder those families?

331
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,832
He changed them?

332
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,665
Don't you crave change, Will?
