A week ago.
In her sleep.

505
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,505
- I'm sorry.

506
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,552
In a place where 2/3
of the residents can't walk,

507
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,555
you put the ramp 1/2 mile away
from the main entrance?

- She lied, Annie.
- For months.

513
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:31,459
- And she chose him over you.

514
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:35,158
- And she's kind of racist.
- She's mostly racist.

515
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:39,598
- She was here because
she fell on ice.

516
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:43,863
- So?
- She was going to the salon.

517
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,648
- It could have
happened anywhere.

518
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,998
- I used to take her there.

519
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,660
- All right.
- Okay.

520
