00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,334
- How's it feel?

364
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,510
- Still light.

365
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,776
- Some fancy ink.

366
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,650
- Pigments from India.

367
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:42,914
- Why I get the feeling this
ink guy's robbing me blind?

368
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,699
- I can't control
the world market.

369
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,139
- Well, bring him by.

370
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,055
- Why?

371
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,665
- I'd like to meet him.

372
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,058
You know, see if we could
work something out.

373
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,712
- He's in Oklahoma.

374
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:01,194
- Thought you said Kansas City.

375
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:04,110
- Isn't that in Oklahoma?

376
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,025
- Missouri.

377
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:11,465
- I'll see what I can do.

378
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,206
- Cool.

379
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:15,730
- What about the next run?

380
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,253
- Yeah, nah,
that's not gonna happen

381
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,646
till I get my costs down.

382
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:19,951
- You're still making a profit.

383
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,997
It's still good business,
right?

384
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,130
- Not if you don't trust
your partners.

385
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,321
- Nah.

386
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,410
- No one even said anything.

387
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,107
- Something off
with your energy.

388
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,675
- We need a loan.

389
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:50,330
It's collateral.

390
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:51,635
- How much you after?

391
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,072
- 30 grand.

392
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,812
- For what?

393
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,988
- Independent contractor.

394
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,949
- You doing a remodel?

395
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,430
- Teardown.

396
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,996
- I mean, it's smarter
to go through your bank

397
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,652
or your credit union
for a home equity loan.

398
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:12,743
- That's not possible.

399
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,790
- You gonna pay
through the nose here.

400
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,839
- It's for a hitman, okay?

401
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,103
Or we could just waste time
on finance metaphors,

402
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,235
and the next thing you know,
we're back in that van.

403
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,069
- So you're looking
for a personal advance.

404
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,027
- Right.

405
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,290
- Yeah.

406
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,595
It's not enough collateral
in the world

407
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,336
for a loan like that.

408
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,729
- Why?

409
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,339
- I mean, when you end up dead,

410
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:46,081
which it sounds like there's
a real strong chance of,

411
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,649
guess who gets stuck
with the tab.

412
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:49,998
- [sighs]

413
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,566
- Metaphor would've taken
five seconds longer.

414
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,264
- And been way more effective.

415
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,006
- Why don't y'all dust off
those pretty OJ masks of yours?

416
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,095
- Like I've been saying.
- We don't do that anymore.

417
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,184
- Why?

418
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,143
- Because we've evolved.

419
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,189
We're entrepreneurs now.

420
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,625
- With no money.

421
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,018
- We are not gonna rob
your store, Annie.

422
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,889
- Dude, it would be so easy.

423
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,413
I would do it myself
if there weren't cameras.

424
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,588
- How easy?

425
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,981
- Like, no security.
In and out.

426
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,767
It would take longer
to fill up a Slurpee.

427
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,422
- Like Lionel Richie easy?

428
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:23,640
- I literally just need someone

429
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,208
to hand the cash to
that isn't me.

430
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,733
- Okay, I see.

431
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,954
You know, I wish you all
would've led with that.

432
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,477
I might be able
to help y'all after all.

433
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,045
- Really?

434
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,003
Is there a different
kind of loan?

435
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,006
- Everybody, on the floor!

436
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,095
- Chill.
It's just me.

437
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,707
Better give me that money,
bitch.

438
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,317
- [sighs]

439
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,232
.

440
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:53,714
- In and out.
Quicker than pouring a Slurpee.

441
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,804
- I mean,
how big is this damn Slurpee?

442
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,112
- Bogey on our left.

443
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,550
- Showtime.

444
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:08,424
Hi, do you have time
to save abandoned babies?

445
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,904
- Uh, kind of in a hurry.

446
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:11,775
- You can't spare a moment?

447
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,517
- For abandoned babies?

448
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:16,737
- I just want to get a water.

449
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,260
- You know who would love
a water?

450
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,696
- The more than 22,000 infants

451
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,830
that are thrown in dumpsters
every year.

452
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,834
- Um, definitely against that.
I just...

453
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,446
- I'm happy to work
a volume discount.

454
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,579
How many units
are we talking about?

455
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:34,363
- Dean, I need a word.
- Sounds great.

456
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,625
You name the time,

457
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,149
and I will have my guys
there to install.

458
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,369
- Now.

459
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,371
- You know what, Richard?
Let me get into this,

460
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,634
and I'll call you right back.

461
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,984
Great. All right, thanks.
Bye.

462
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,159
I just don't get why
all that money

463
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,291
has to go back to corporate.

464
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,727
- So you're calling
the shots now?

465
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,294
- No,
but I can't make my numbers

466
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,730
just selling barbecue tongs.

467
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,558
- And I can't have my men
going rogue.

468
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,168
It's not how we do things here.

469
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,214
- Oh, I know.

470
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,694
- What's that supposed to mean?

471
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:03,436
- I think
you know what it means.

472
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,309
- Pack up your desk.

473
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,485
- Seriously?

474
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,488
- Forward me
your open projects.

475
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,185
- That's how
you're gonna play this?

476
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,276
- Keys in the night box.

477
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,541
- No.

478
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:24,326
- Excuse me?
- No.

479
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,806
- No, what, Dean?

480
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,635
- I'm not gonna pretend
like you're firing me

481
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,246
for a legit work reason
when the truth is

482
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,119
you're only pissed off
'cause I won't tap that.

483
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:38,601
- Get out of my office.
- Oh, come on, Gayle.

484
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,908
- I'm about to call corporate
and have you blacklisted

485
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,997
from every showroom
in the country.

486
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,304
- Great.
Put it on speaker.

487
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,783
- What?

488
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:50,265
- I'll tell them how you
promote using only your vagina.

489
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,223
- You think I'm Roger Ailes?

490
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,356
No one cares about me.

491
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,403
And they certainly
don't care about you.

492
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:00,188
- They care about Eric.
He's a lifer.

493
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,712
- So?
- So he knows everything.

494
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:05,367
- Why would he risk
his job for you?

495
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:09,066
- Because I promised him yours
once I get you out.

496
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,721
So here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna walk back over there.

497
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,550
I'm gonna complete that sale
you so rudely interrupted.

498
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,378
I'm gonna take
another of Jeff's leads

499
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,075
and another and another
and I'm gonna turn

500
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,904
this joke of an operation
into the number one leader

501
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:23,994
in Southeast Michigan's
regional sales.

502
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,828
Open or closed?
- Leave.

503
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:34,396
- Is there a website
I can go to?

504
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,442
- Your donation today

505
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,096
helps get a baby
out of the trash.

506
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,141
- I don't have any cash on me.

507
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,229
- How were you gonna buy
the water?

508
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:42,578
- We're happy to take a card.

509
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,626
- Maybe next time.

510
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,719
- How much longer
can we do this?

511
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,421
- Deep breaths.
Everybody just stay calm.

512
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:00,944
We can figure this out.

513
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:04,034
- Don't worry, ladies.
I'm licensed to carry.

514
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,564
- Where is it?
- Get out of here.

515
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:12,826
- Not until I get it all back.

516
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,567
- Hey, man,
we don't want any trouble.

517
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,872
- Yeah? Well,
you should've told her that

518
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,439
before she cleaned out
my wife's jewelry box.

519
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,745
- What's he talking about?

520
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:20,399
- So go to Cartier
and buy her some more.

521
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,704
- Or I'll just go to the cops.

522
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,706
- Okay, yeah, then they can
take my statement.

523
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,579
I'm not gonna leave out
any details for your wife.

524
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:42,551
- That was my soup.

525
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,423
- Oh. Oops.
Sorry.

526
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,163
- What the hell was that?

527
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:47,861
- Those guys are all dicks.

528
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:50,472
- Is that where the money
came from?

529
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,474
- I'm doing his wife a favor.

530
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,302
He's gonna replace it
with something better.

531
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,478
- What do you got me
involved in?

532
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,001
- These guys are all the same,
okay?

533
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,699
They send their wives
off to New York to see

534
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,527
"Dear Evan Hansen"
while they hump Detroit.

535
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,094
- Jesus, Krystal.

536
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:06,314
- They totally deserve it.

537
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,098
- And how much of my cut
