00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,758
or the D-bag?

180
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,978
- Where is this guy?

181
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,243
[sighs]

182
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:42,505
- Oh.

183
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:47,554
- Hm.

184
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,645
- Yeah...

185
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,139
- Mrs. Boland.

186
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:10,098
- Beth is fine.

187
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:14,537
- Max got me up to speed
on what y'all are looking for.

188
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,844
- Awesome.
- Cool, cool.

189
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:21,501
- And do you feel like
it's something that you're...

190
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,198
capable of?

191
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,418
- If I'm being
totally honest here,

192
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,508
I might not have
what it takes.

193
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,032
- Really?

194
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,947
- But you've done
this kind of job before?

195
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,557
- I work mainly
with explosives.

196
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,863
- Oh. That makes sense.

197
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:39,040
- Car bombs, IEDs,
pyrotechnics,

198
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,172
stuff that really,
you know...

199
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,175
- Leaves a mark.

200
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,699
- Bingo.

201
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:46,961
From what Max said
about your target,

202
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:50,791
he's not a guy who's so easy
to get close to.

203
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,924
You're gonna need a sniper.

204
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,754
- Well, where do we find
one of those?

205
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,104
- I know a guy.
Already got him up to speed.

206
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,585
- Hold on a minute.

207
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:03,978
Max got you up to speed

208
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,110
so you could get
another guy up to speed?

209
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,721
- How many speeds
are we looking at here?

210
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,287
- He's who you want.

211
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,680
- Who is "he"?

212
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,813
- I have no idea.

213
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:13,901
He's that good.

214
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:16,120
- Well, how do we find him?

215
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,470
- He finds you.

216
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,995
- Okay,
we've got a bit of a problem

217
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,476
'cause we're in a time crunch.

218
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,392
We provide a service
for the target--

219
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:32,746
- That we are not
currently able to provide, so--

220
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:37,315
- So we need to...

221
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:43,017
neutralize our target
before we become his target.

222
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,586
- You want it done right,
don't you?

223
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,414
Thumbs up, or thumbs down?

224
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,155
- Thumb...

225
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,374
thumbs up?

226
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,202
- Gonna need to see 'em.

227
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,738
Now put them up your asses

228
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:12,394
'cause this might take
a hot minute.

229
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:24,145
.

230
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,190
- And so when the song
came out, I was like,

231
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,104
"Hello, Mr. Smith,
I've been saying

232
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:30,020
'get jiggy wit it' since '91."

233
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,848
- And when did it
hit the clubs?

234
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,676
- '95, earliest.

235
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,765
- Guys, I have news.

236
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,854
Just got heads up
from corporate.

237
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:41,118
We're not supposed to know,
so act super surprised.

238
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,686
But we just won
the Crystal Whale

239
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,776
for the Southeastern
Michigan division.

240
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:51,781
- Dope.

241
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,440
- Great job, everyone.
Let's get back to work.

242
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,451
- You got some nerve.

243
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,018
- What's your problem now?

244
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:14,064
- Every person on that floor
busts their ass for this place.

245
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,980
They go to conferences,
they chase every lead,

246
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,286
they work overtime,
they never see their kids,

247
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,635
and for what?
To get dressed up

248
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,854
and watch you
collect some award

249
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:24,858
for co-signing their deals?

250
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,209
- I told them
to put your name on it.

251
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,645
- What?

252
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,299
- You have a choice of walnut

253
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:34,258
or mahogany base.

254
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,785
Mahogany ages better.

255
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,005
- Why me?

256
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,094
- Your first month here,
you got higher sales

257
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,009
than Eric had in eight years.

258
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,405
- Thanks.
- You earned it.

259
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,932
Oh, would you tell the team
that they're allowed

260
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:59,719
to have fun at the show?
I'm not a total monster.

261
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,809
- Why don't you
just tell them yourself?

262
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:05,115
- I'm gonna skip this year.

263
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,118
Use my ticket for your wife.

264
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:22,219
- I like Circus Peanut.

265
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:25,005
- It's too bright.
- Yeah, Island Mango's closer.

266
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,616
- The hue's off.

267
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,227
- Well, can't you just
do a combo thing?

268
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,845
- I am not McDonald's.
I don't just do combos.

269
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,977
It took months
to get this thing legit.

270
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,284
- [sighs]
Check your phone.

271
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,634
- I just did.
- Did you check Facebook?

272
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,375
- 'Cause a hitman's
gonna friend-request me?

273
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,681
- Oh, like you're so versed
in how they communicate.

274
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:50,900
[huffs]

275
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,293
- It doesn't
have to be perfect.

276
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,990
It just has to be good enough
to buy us some time.

277
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,600
- Yeah, come on, girl.
Beast mode.

278
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,428
- You got this.

279
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,997
- One part Peach En Fuego,
one part Tang Bang,

280
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:05,349
a few drops of Prairie Fire...

281
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:08,439
And a smidge
of Oh My Darlin' Clementine.

282
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,354
- Fire up the press.

283
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,365
Why don't we talk about--
- No.

284
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,454
- You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

285
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,023
- One question,
then we move on.

286
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,156
- Great.
- Fine.

287
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,245
- Now?
- Shoot.

288
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,162
- Why her?

289
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,166
- We're compatible.

290
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,124
- The woman dehydrates fruit.

291
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,213
- My favorite.

292
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,868
- She loves Pilates.
- So do I.

293
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,131
- No man loves that.

294
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,177
- Well, that's how
relationships work, Annie,

295
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,787
at least healthy ones.

296
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,267
- Hot.

297
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,227
- Say there's 100 things
about a person you could like.

298
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,100
Connect to anything over 50,
and it will last.

299
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,580
- Whew. Scorching hot.
- It's not a bad thing

300
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,713
for partnerships
to make sense on paper.

301
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,978
- I guess I just
don't really believe in lists.

302
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,937
- Taking inventory
of a relationship

303
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,070
helps you realize
what matters.

304
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:18,466
- Ah.
Like Pilates and dried fruit.

305
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,861
- Those are just two,
but yeah.

306
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,211
- Gotcha, boss.

307
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,563
- That's enough for today.

308
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,261
- I still have
three minutes left.

309
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,394
- I'll credit your account.

310
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,006
- Look, all I'm saying
is that I'd rather not

311
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,182
have to crunch numbers
to find my mate.

312
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,663
- How's that gone for you?

313
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,063
- That is enough for today.

314
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,768
- Oh, by the way,
Mrs. Karpinski said

315
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,510
she may have a futon for us.

316
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:05,034
- We would be sitting
on a giant litterbox

317
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,688
with all those cats.

318
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:12,172
- Oh, and I won
the Crystal Whale.

319
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,653
- Really?

320
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,742
- You are looking
at the Southeastern Michigan

321
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,267
regional hot tub king.

322
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,530
- Spa.
- Spa.

323
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,532
Spa king.

324
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,231
Will you come?
- Of course.

325
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,973
- Will you wear that dress?

326
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,541
- What dress?

327
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,589
- The one you wore for him.

328
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,548
[cell phone buzzes]

329
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,479
- What's that?

330
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,525
- Money.

331
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,485
- No.

332
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,356
It's not.

333
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,316
- Yeah, it is.
- Not money I could use.

334
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,277
- Oh,
we had to change the formula.

335
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,410
- Change it back.

336
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,588
- It's not possible.

337
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,034
- Yo, I been
thinking about this, um,

338
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,212
relationship of ours.

339
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:39,346
Lot of issues,
you and me.

340
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,742
- I don't disagree.

341
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:48,007
- Cut you in.
That didn't work.

342
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,445
Gun to your head.
Nothing.

343
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:57,059
I don't know how to
incentivize you anymore.

344
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:59,496
So...

345
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,464
Open it.

346
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:22,911
- I don't get it.

347
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,696
- [laughs]
Take it out.

348
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,438
- I don't want to.

349
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,614
- We got another job
for you.

350
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,967
- Well, whatever it is,
I don't want to do it.

351
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,621
- Oh.
[laughs]

352
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,710
[both laugh]

353
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,845
Take it out, Elizabeth.

354
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,034
Maybe you're right.

355
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,167
