1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,875
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

2
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:06,832
They're gonna take the house.

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,095
I made you something.

4
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,705
It's literally
nail polish remover,

5
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,402
hydrogen peroxide,
and bleach.

6
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:12,795
- She's
a terrible human being,

7
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,797
and she thinks,
because she lives

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,539
in this clean little bubble,
that on one's gonna notice.

9
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:20,324
Be good, okay?

10
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,283
- Maybe the man
just needed a greeting card.

11
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:24,502
- Throw it on.

12
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,113
- Thanks again
for working your magic.

13
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,505
- I wish I could do more.

14
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,464
I murdered the kids' dad,
all right?

15
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,161
- Marcus' dad
he sets us up.

16
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:33,250
- What if he doesn't come back?
- How much?

17
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:35,078
- I'm not taking your money.

18
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,428
- Can we not use the phrase
"a friend."

19
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,342
- He's dead.

20
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:40,301
- One last name popped up.

21
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,135
- Well, how much
did you get for it?

22
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,572
- 300.

23
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:37,314
- Well, where am I
supposed to put my clothes?

24
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,968
- Where you put 'em now.

25
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:52,590
- You know
that grandfather clock has been

26
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,897
in my family
for, like, two generations?

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,159
- The girls think it's haunted.

28
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,987
- Yeah,
with the Boland dynasty.

29
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,684
- It has nine bids, Dean.

30
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,177
- Well, what about
your country, rustic thingy?

31
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,092
- No offers yet.

32
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,876
- So surprised.

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,269
- We need the money, okay?

34
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,366
- I got to pay her back, Dean.
I just got to pay her back.

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,507
- Hey, Mama.

36
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,204
- Daddy!
- What's up, man?

37
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,119
How you doing?

38
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,166
- Need to get
that doorbell fixed.

39
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,515
- Hey, Mom.

40
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,392
- I made you something.

41
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:56,828
Want to see it?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,265
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,267
Check it out.

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,703
It's cool?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:02,791
- Yeah?

46
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,793
- He missed you.

47
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,099
- I'm back now.

48
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,492
So what's up?

49
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,233
- Can you come
to one of my games?

50
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,757
- Yeah.
Yeah, Mama got you hoopin' now?

51
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,063
- No, soccer.

52
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:15,238
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,979
- How you get into that?

54
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,677
- A mom friend at the park.

55
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:32,255
- We're not paying her
to check Instagram.

56
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,083
- It's fine, it's fine.

57
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,825
- We're paying her to make sure
that our baby doesn't die.

58
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,219
- All right.
All right.

59
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,916
- Uh...

60
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,439
To nationals, huh?

61
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:45,268
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:48,663
- Resolved...that my son
is the coolest, smartest,

63
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:51,056
most talkiest debater in
all of southeastern Michigan...

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,406
- Okay.

65
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,537
- Soon to be
the entire nation.

66
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,408
- Mom.

67
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,888
- Yay, Sadie!

68
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,977
- Ben.

69
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,547
- Of course, yeah

70
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,898
I'mI'm sorry.
- It's okay.

71
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,770
- Takes a minute.

72
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,380
- Ben.

73
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,296
- To Ben.
- To Ben, to Ben.

74
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,950
- Your order will be up
in just a minute.

75
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,256
- Thanks.
- Oh.

76
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:21,086
- So now that we're all to

77
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,185
Can I have a green tea?
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,973
- So we wanted to thank you.

79
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,366
- Oh

80
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,193
- For what?
- No, no, not here.

81
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,934
- We're in couples therapy.

82
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,806
- Oh, yep, there it is.

83
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,026
- Andand we're really doing
great work.

84
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,682
- Well, I guess we have
a lot to celebrate.

85
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:55,120
- And Dr. Cohen mentioned
that you could possibly play

86
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,688
a role in our healing.

87
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,386
- Ew.

88
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,693
- Well, that's not really
what he said exactly.

89
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:03,999
- Well, honey, he did say

90
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,783
that she's the reason
that you slipped up.

91
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,568
- Excuse me.
- Can I use the restroom?

92
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,134
- Yes.
- Yes, now.

93
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:10,745
- Please.

94
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,094
- Okay, look,
in the spirit of Ben

95
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,706
What else did, uh,
Dr. Cohen say?

96
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,361
- What if we just table
this debate, huh?

97
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:22,757
- Well, he said
that you're a tiny bit...

98
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,020
broken.

99
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:27,022
- Wow.

100
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,285
- And a little bit lost.

101
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,635
- Wow.
- Oh, God.

102
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,985
- And that you are trying
to fix yourself

103
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:37,772
by using my husband's...

104
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,383
you know...

105
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,385
Andand that it's just
kind of, like,

106
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,909
this dysfunctional pattern,

107
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:47,085
and it is going to
keep repeating itself

108
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,784
until we all...

109
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:53,091
figure this out.

110
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,703
- It's deep stuff.

111
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,313
- Mm.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,795
- Yeah.
- What's your take, Gregg?

113
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:04,799
- Um, just
that if you would like

114
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,192
to talk with him

115
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,107
that we would cover it.

116
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,805
- I have his card.

117
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,504
Here.

118
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:17,594
- Your Dante's Inferno.

119
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,703
- You sure?

120
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,444
- We got to pay electric.

121
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,185
- What about our phone?

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,275
Send the check
for phone to water.

123
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:47,972
Send the water to phone.

124
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,063
- They see we had
good intentions.

125
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:55,110
- Yeah, take 'em at least
a couple weeks to sort out.

126
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,547
- And we still take showers.

127
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,115
- Yeah, well, not Li'l Money.

128
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,335
- Truly, he smells like
hamsters and burps.

129
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,428
- I hate how good we are
at this.

130
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,648
- I know.
Bill roulette.

131
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:14,259
Hey, still works.

132
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,960
- Hey, Darryl.

133
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,445
When?

134
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:31,102
- What do you mean
by "helping"?

135
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,191
- Pointing out everything
that I'm doing wrong.

136
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,106
-  Dog,
I've been on that for years.

137
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,544
- Oh, she's more specific...

138
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,024
Like where I keep
my trash bags,

139
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,939
what I feed my kids,

140
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,681
the way I wear my "rouge,"
as she puts it.

141
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,857
- Too much, right?

142
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,949
- Too little.

143
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,908
- Hmm.

144
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:57,651
- Hey, uh, this hot dog
tastes weird.

145
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:01,524
- It's been spinning under
a light bulb for three days.

146
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,308
- I need a refund.

147
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:06,094
- You bought gas station meat.
Make better choices.

148
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,357
- Hey, can I talk
to your manager?

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,054
- Ooh.

150
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:21,631
Just kick her ass to the curb.

151
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:25,200
- She's cleaning
and doing the laundry.

152
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:28,333
She ironed Dean's underwear.

153
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,643
It's Ruby.

154
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,515
Hey, lady.

155
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,001
Do you guys sell flowers?

156
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,571
- Jesus.

157
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,313
- Yeah.

158
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:55,665
- What is up with the
teddy bears at these things?

159
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,625
I just mean...
they were adults.

160
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,631
Everybody go to the same Kroger
to get flowers?

161
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,371
- Can you not?

162
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,112
- I'm just saying.

163
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,114
- The man is dead, okay?

164
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,206
- He did try to frame Stan.

165
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,730
- Annie.

166
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,472
- And lock us up.

167
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,126
- He lost his life.

168
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,607
- Okay.

169
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,095
- That's not how that works.

170
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,972
- You all right?

171
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,586
- It is really weird.

172
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,609
- Guess we're back in business.

173
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:22,839
.

174
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:24,362
- Here's what we do.

175
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,538
- Little help here?

176
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:29,933
- We print 20 mil, one big run,
buy a giant super yacht.

177
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,501
- Can I put
my mother-in-law on it?

178
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,068
Round-the-world cruise?

179
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,113
- Round and round
and then round again.

180
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,115
No, because we sell it

181
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,161
for a fleet of private jets

182
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,249
money washed.

183
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,946
Boom.

184
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,861
- What do we do with jets?

185
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,036
- Sell 'em to the Saudis.

186
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,385
Boom.

187
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,866
- Stop saying "boom."
- Um, and we need that.

188
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,477
- Fine.

189
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,523
How would you wash
the money?

190
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,135
- What would he do?

191
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,659
- She means gang friend.

192
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,704
- Yeah, I connected those dots.

193
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,490
- He outsourced.

194
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,928
- Yeah, we did that, and we got
banned from Costco for life.

195
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:11,671
- Literally, I grocery shop
at the dollar store.

196
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,325
- Okay...

197
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:17,328
what if we didn't use
people like us?

198
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,682
- You mean like
people like him?

199
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,074
- Yeah.

200
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,338
- Where do we find
those people?

201
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,996
- Hey, how was soccer?

202
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,216
- I got to play goalie.

203
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,349
- I thought Marcus was goalie.
- He didn't come today.

204
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,658
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

205
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,751
- Your rouge is just lovely.

206
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,405
- Free sample.

207
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,407
- Oh, what about mine, Judith?

208
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,757
- Please, you've got youth.

209
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,281
- Beth, are you home
for dinner,

210
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,674
or will you be
at the card shop?

211
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,546
- It's not just cards, Judith.

212
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,070
They have gifts and

213
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,246
- You sold my clock?

214
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,988
My ancestors brought that

215
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,207
across the country
in a covered wagon.

216
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:14,298
- Well, it's going back across
to Phil Hanson in a box truck.

217
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,475
- Well, it's your wedding gift.

218
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,261
I'll start the stroganoff.

219
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:27,137
- I mean,
her rouge is on point.

220
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,226
- I hate you both.

221
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,406
- See you, Dean.
- Yeah, have a good one.

222
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,452
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

223
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,430
- Hey, you.

224
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:01,345
How do you like my fish?

225
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,825
- Can't wait to catch my own.

226
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:06,568
I just wish I knew how
to get my sales up, you know?

227
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,005
- I got to let you in
on something, Dean.

228
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,268
It'll be our secret.

229
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,444
No one needs a hot tub.

230
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,186
Okay.

231
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,319
Well, how'd you get all those?

232
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,756
- Landscapers,
contractors, realtors.

233
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,758
It's a relationship game.

234
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:27,937
I'll tell you, it sucks to be
the new kid at school.

235
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,373
- Why don't I introduce you?

236
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,027
- Seriously?

237
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,682
- Come to dinner Thursday.
I'm meeting some developers.

238
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,599
- Thanks.

239
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,472
I'll head back.
Thank you.

240
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:47,130
- How is it being
a mental patient?

241
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,698
- It's okay.

242
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:52,483
- What's your damage?

243
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,878
- My parents
are getting a divorce.

244
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,054
- What's that
got to do with you?

245
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,363
- They're my parents.

246
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,887
- Yeah, so, like,
why aren't they here?

247
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,367
- I don't know.

248
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,329
- You do drugs?

249
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,028
- No.

250
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,465
- You got a girlfriend?

251
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:20,076
- There's a girl
I sort of like.

252
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,904
- Well, she like you back?

253
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,907
- She sits next to me
on the bus.

254
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,517
- You're fine.

255
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:29,999
- Hey, come on in, Tim.

256
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,045
- Actually, one sec.

257
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,829
This'll just take a sec.

258
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,397
Real quick, Tim.
Here we go.

259
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,399
Yeah.
- Okay.

260
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,750
- What's Otsego University?

261
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:44,927
- A nationally
accredited college.

262
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,537
- Where's the campus?

263
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,931
- Online.
- Bingo.

264
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,715
- Well, your country's
quite stingy with visas.

265
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,717
- Oh, so you're illegal.

266
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,328
- Are you from the board?

267
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:56,547
- You know, you might want to
lay down for this, Dr. Cohen...

268
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:57,897
- No one really does that.

269
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,900
- Because I am not lost,
I'm not broken,

270
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,727
and I am certainly
not the reason

271
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,555
that Gregory
cheated on his wife.

272
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,383
You hear me?
- Loud and clear.

273
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,645
Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

274
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,473
Because I'm about to deliver
some straight talk

275
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:11,258
that's gonna help you
render your verdict

276
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,563
or whatever it is
you people call it.

277
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,348
- We call it a diagnosis.

278
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,132
- He came to me, okay?

279
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:19,962
He came to me because
that marriage is a joke.

280
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,659
Mm-hmm, yeah.

281
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,618
So it's not really my fault
that he got tired of boning

282
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,620
an ice queen whose idea
of getting wild

283
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,230
is leaving her bra on
for a quickie.

284
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,406
- Oh, man, I mean,
who'd want to tap that?

285
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,060
- Well, not her husband,

286
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,628
especially not after being
locked up in a McMansion

287
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,804
where you can't even choose
your own outfits,

288
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,588
or, God forbid,
you try to talk about something

289
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,416
other than ways
to jack up your face

290
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,157
with lip fillers
and butt cement.

291
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,811
- Wow.
- Yeah.

292
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,248
- Yeah, it sounds like
they've got you all wrong.

293
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,990
- Yes, yes.

294
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:51,776
Now, what are you
gonna do about it, Otsego?

295
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,344
Oh, uh, I don't need
a prescription, okay?

296
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:55,998
- Oh, no, that's fine.
That's fine.

297
00:15:56,042 --> 00:16:00,307
Um...here's who
you're looking for, I think

298
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,005
Dr. Eli Cohen.

299
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,095
I'm Josh Cohen.

300
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,532
I work with kids.

301
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,235
Yeah, um, Eli's upstairs
in a suite.

302
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,586
- Oh.

303
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,155
- You'll like him.
He went to a real college.

304
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:27,290
- Well, thank you
for listening.

305
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,683
- On the house.

306
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,077
- That's so nice.

307
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,952
- Do you mind sending Tim in?
- No, not at all.

308
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,347
- Thanks.
-  I'll just...

309
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,001
Oh, Tim?

310
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,047
- No, leave it open.
Yeah.

311
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,744
- "Coal black"?

312
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:49,660
Now, how's that different
from coal gray and ink black?

313
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,749
- Hold it to the light.

314
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,838
I mean, where is this guy?

315
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,666
- Why can't they just make
blackblack?

316
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,668
- Is anyone working?
- You know, funeral black.

317
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,627
You know, say exactly what
you need it for.

318
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,978
- Oh, okay, I see.
It's like that.

319
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,806
All right,
we're out of here.

320
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,460
- I need to buy a suit, Ruby.

321
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,028
- You got to go to this thing?
The man tried to put you away.

322
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,247
- Okay, I'm going
for the families.

323
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,206
- Be right with you, folks.

324
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,555
- Oh, really?

325
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,296
- Okay, okay, calm down, chief.

326
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,428
- I mean, the time to be
right with us is long gone.

327
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,647
- Babe, not now.

328
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,475
- How we doing over here?

329
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:22,650
- We were better
before you started

330
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:23,999
Snapchatting your bestie.

331
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,914
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you.

332
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:30,614
- And that, Brian,
is exactly the problem.

333
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,884
- Yeah, so do you guys,
uh, validate

334
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,538
even if you
don't buy anything?

335
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,671
- Let's go, Stanley!

336
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
- Hey, I'm just checking in.

337
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,199
Uh, Jane said that Marcus
wasn't at soccer today,

338
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,288
so, um...

339
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,421
I hope he doesn't have that bug
that's going around.

340
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,771
Danny had it last week.
It's really brutal.

341
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,947
I'm waiting for it to take out
the rest of us.

342
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,733
Um, anyway, uh, yeah,
just call me back.

343
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,171
I hope you guys are okay.

344
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,695
- Hey, how much, uhhow much
cash do you have on you?

345
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,436
- Why?

346
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,960
- We need to tip
the movers pretty big.

347
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,527
- Why?

348
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,573
- Well, I kind ofI kind of
stepped in it with one of them.

349
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,053
- Which one?

350
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,750
- The guy with the tat
with the girl on it

351
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,405
the one with super detail
with the boobs, the nipple,

352
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,667
and the camel toe.

353
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,147
- All right.

354
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,109
What did you say?

355
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,762
- I made some stupid joke
about most movers

356
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,068
coming straight
out of prison.

357
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,591
I wasn't even talking
about those guys.

358
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,506
- Okay, so?

359
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,247
- So they're straight
out of prison,

360
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,597
and the lead guy
with the tattoo thingy,

361
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,773
his rap sheet reads
like a CVS receipt.

362
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,514
He's telling me
like he's proud

363
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,474
armed robbery,
forced entry, kidnapping,

364
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,476
something-class two
with animals.

365
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,869
We're talking
full-on criminal, Beth.

366
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,372
- Lemonade?

367
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:24,511
.

368
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,817
- We have an employee, okay?

369
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,864
He's gonna wash
exactly like we did, except...

370
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,518
- Where did this guy
go to prison?

371
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,694
- I don't know.
He didn't have a résumé.

372
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,957
- Yeah, but is he
more Martha Stewart

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,263
or Suge Knight?

374
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,178
- I don't think he plays golf.

375
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:43,007
- Oh, great.
So we're rape bait.

376
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:46,837
- Well, can't get all of us.

377
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,840
I mean, not all at once.

378
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,843
- Great.
So he gets me while you watch?

379
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,628
- No, we run for help.

380
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:58,501
- The point is, he's gonna wash
in ways that we can't.

381
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,851
- So how's he gonna do it?

382
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,028
- Not Costco.

383
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,561
- How much are these?

384
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,040
- $9.95.

385
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,836
- 50/50, right?

386
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,361
- What?
No.

387
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,929
- What we agreed on.

388
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,887
- We said ten.

389
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,715
- I meant 50.

390
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:43,067
- Uh, Beth.

391
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,818
- 48 hours.

392
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,450
- Well, no one got raped.
- Sort of.

393
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,505
- Ben's at a friend's.

394
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,986
- I-I came for you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

395
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,467
- It came out wrong, okay?
- Oh, which part

396
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,295
the needy and slutty...

397
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,297
Or the lost and broken?

398
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,168
- She's still hurt
and, like, super mad.

399
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,430
- That I get.

400
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,519
- It's just her way
of processing it, okay?

401
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,826
- What I don't understand is
how you could possibly think

402
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,437
that your penis wasn't
equally at fault here, Gregg.

403
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,047
- What do you want
me to do, Annie?

404
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,050
- Stand up for me for once.
- You didn't want me.

405
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,530
- You had a baby with her.

406
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,837
- Yeah, and now that's why
I got to try and fix it.

407
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,665
- I feel bad for you.

408
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,623
- Okay.

409
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,799
- You know, you could see
every shrink on the planet,

410
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,888
and you'd still
never sack up.

411
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,803
- Nice.

412
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,414
- Good luck
on your spiritual journey.

413
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,111
- Got it.

414
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,113
- Find the light, Gregory.

415
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:14,028
- You know what?

416
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,160
You're lucky.

417
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,684
- Why's that?

418
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:22,384
- Because it must be nice
being just so perfect.

419
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,657

God is great. God is good.

420
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,399
By His blessings, we are fed.

421
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:40,271
Give us, Lord, our daily bread.

422
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:41,490
- Amen.

423
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,057
- Mom.
- Hi, Mommy.

424
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,407
- I thought you'd be selling
your cards tonight.

425
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,061
- Not just cards, Judith.

426
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:48,802
- Let me get you a seat.

427
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,894
- So we're praying
at dinner now?

428
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:56,418
- Yeah, Mom thought
it would be fun.

429
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,377
- Hmm.

430
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,639
How'd it go today?

431
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,641
- He sold another Boland.

432
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,033
- That's not
what they're called, Mom.

433
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:06,254
- Tell that to
the Jacuzzi family.

434
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,951
- Are we going to be famous?

435
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:11,868
- Ooh, when Daddy has his own
spa named after him, yes.

436
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:13,870
- We're a long way
from that, dear.

437
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,307
There you go.

438
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:18,527
- Mommy's in the baby chair.

439
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:21,574
- What do you call
a cow who's masturbating?

440
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:24,446
Beef stroganoff.

441
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,580
Get it?
It's a cow that's, you know...

442
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,843
- Kenneth Irving Boland.

443
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:33,803
- Kenny, why don't you go
do your homework?

444
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,544
- He needs to finish
his dinner.

445
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,900
- So the Jacuzzis
were actually brothers.

446
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,859
- Do you want
to be finished, KB?

447
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,078
- Yeah.
- Go play video games.

448
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,341
- They've had plenty
of screen time.

449
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:53,127
- And throw in some YouTube.

450
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:00,961
- There were seven of 'em,

451
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,354
and they started out
making airplane propellers.

452
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,142
- Got to be in the clean-plate
club to get dessert.

453
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,721
- One of 'em died
in a plane crash, and...

454
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,636
they decided to scrap it

455
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,595
andand just focus
on impellers

456
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,118
and hydrodynamics instead.

457
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:30,294
- You can have
as much dessert as you want.

458
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,080
- All I know is there are
plenty of starving children

459
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,865
in Africa that would love
to have this food.

460
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,565
- Ship it to 'em.

461
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,523
Come on, let's go crush
some brownies.

462
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,786
- I'm in the clean-plate club!
- Me too!

463
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,442
- I want brownies!

464
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,879
- I get the first on!

465
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,756
And that's how they got

466
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,106
in the whirlpool game.

467
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,511
- I appreciate
you helping us out.

468
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,995
- Did Dean ever tell you
I worked?

469
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,781
- No.

470
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:25,001
- After he was born,

471
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:28,831
I was sitting on a bag
of frozen peas,

472
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,355
squirting water down there
so I could tinkle

473
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,836
without my parts catching fire.

474
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,621
- Nobody tells you
what it's like.

475
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,361
- That you'll come out
all stitched back together

476
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,537
like Humpty Dumpty.

477
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,408
- We'd never have kids.

478
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:43,716
- And everyone's fawning
over this perfect baby boy,

479
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,109
while I'm just...

480
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,549
Nothing...

481
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,031
empty,
flesh and hormones over ice.

482
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:04,606
- I had postpartum
after Jane.

483
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,696
- Back then, they called it
"a nervous condition."

484
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,655
Judith.

485
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:13,093
- So I became a shopgirl.

486
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:15,748
Got dressed up, dropped
the baby with a neighbor,

487
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,446
took the bus downtown,
and you know what?

488
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,491
I felt like a person again...

489
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:23,451
with a purpose.

490
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,888
- Why'd you stop?

491
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:28,195
- I made a quarter
of what John made,

492
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:32,242
and my son was being raised
by wolves.

493
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:36,290
Dean's boss called him
management material.

494
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:41,904
- Your happiness
was important, too.

495
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,908
- How much
does the card shop pay?

496
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,171
- You shouldn't have quit.

497
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,086
- And you should be home
for dinner

498
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,612
if you don't want
the kids saying grace.

499
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,484
What a lie, huh?

500
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,617
That we can have it all.

501
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:10,585
.

502
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,848
- That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

503
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,633
- It's no crazier
than saying "Jacuzzi."

504
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,026
- Ooh, I slept funny.

505
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,246
- I know something
that could work that right out.

506
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,030
- All right.
- What's that?

507
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,250
- Take a Boland.

508
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,817
- Nice, steamy Boland.

509
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,254
- Oh, a big, bubbling Boland.

510
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,082
- Coming in off the ski slopes.

511
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,213
- Rough day at work?

512
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,824
- Grab your favorite magazine.

513
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,086
- Pop out back.

514
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:35,131
- Step into a foamy Boland.

515
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:38,091
- Yeah!

516
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,267
- Where is this guy?

517
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,182
- I don't know.
I don't know if he's lost.

518
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,445
- Text him.
- I just did.

519
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,403
- What if he went
to the paper place?

520
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,275
- I gave him the address.

521
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:51,365
- What if he's not coming?

522
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,412
- Yo.

523
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:58,459
- Hi.
It's Beth.

524
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,940
I'm just calling
for a quick ETA.

525
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:03,290
- I'm not gonna make it.

526
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,423
- Oh, uh...

527
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,425
do you need
to reschedule?

528
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,384
- No, I'm good.

529
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,824
- But you owe us some money.

530
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,218
- Yeah, I did some math,
and it works out

531
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:21,221
way better for me
if I take 100%.

532
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,878
- What?

533
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,708
Hello?

534
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:32,754
- Did he say "math" or "meth"?

535
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,364
- Call him back.
- And do what?

536
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,105
Say "please"?

537
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:42,764
- You have reached
the voice mailbox of 313

538
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:48,117
- Let's do what he would do.

539
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,815
- He would make him
eat a Glock.

540
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,860
- Okay, let's do that.

541
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,863
- Beth, you're not
a scary gangbanger

542
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:56,169
with throat tats.

543
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,127
You're a mom with
a Chinese symbol on your hip

544
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,825
you got on Spring Break.

545
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,827
- Wait, I thought
you got that lasered.

546
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,176
- It is so expensive.

547
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,787
- You are never gonna be him.

548
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,833
So let's just suck it up,
print some more.

549
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,399
- Are you serious?

550
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:10,705
- We have the plates.
We have the press.

551
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,621
- That last run cost us
a grand in ones.

552
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,710
- We have to find
another career criminal.

553
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,234
- What happens when that guy
decides to renegotiate?

554
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,062
- Then we make more.

555
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,934
- And then that guy?

556
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:23,979
- We make more.

557
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,329
- And then every criminal
in the city knows

558
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,071
that we're a bunch of suckers.

559
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,813
- Well, can't have it all.

560
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,301
- I'm a pillar
of the community.

561
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,651
I organize
the neighborhood watch.

562
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,784
I'm on the PTA,
Chamber of Commerce.

563
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:49,091
I post on Yelp,
Angie's List, Nextdoor.

564
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,790
I am a den mother,
for God's sake.

565
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,617
- Ma'am, again,
I apologize

566
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,532
- Yeah, well, that's not gonna
put the 500 bucks

567
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:57,883
back in my son's piggy bank.

568
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,407
Do you know how many lawns
he had to mow for that?

569
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,237
- Now, is it possible...

570
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,935
that he misplaced it?

571
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,545
- Really?

572
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:11,810
$500 goes missing
on the exact day

573
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,900
that this guy
is loose in my house?

574
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,945
- I didn't take
this bitch's money.

575
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,469
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

576
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:22,995
A lot of strong emotions here.

577
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,779
- I just want my money.

578
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,607
- You might want to be careful
about who you're coming at

579
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,652
with all these
accusations.

580
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:31,264
- No, I-I am sure
that we can work something out.

581
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:34,615
- Or this bitch
could take it up

582
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,051
with his parole officer.

583
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:41,317
How many violations do you get
before they send you back?

584
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,892
- We're gonna take
another good look around.

585
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,894
- I'd appreciate that.

586
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,256
- What's this?

587
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,475
- Don't start.

588
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,303
- I hope it's not
a coal black suit.

589
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:13,175
- Yep, and I got
the pocket square, too.

590
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,829
- Why would you go back there?

591
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,397
- They're the only place
that does layaway.

592
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,142
- How long did you wait?

593
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:26,101
Please let me make my sandwich
- How long?

594
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:30,932
- You're exhausting.

595
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:33,500
- Maybe you need
to be more exhausting.

596
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:34,675
- And what does that mean?

597
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,329
- You're so used
to being disrespected,

598
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:37,939
you don't even see it
happening anymore.

599
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,506
- Babe, you go HAM
every time they seat us

600
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,811
by a bathroom
in a restaurant.

601
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,552
- Why should we sit
by the bathroom?

602
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,598
- Somebody's got to.
- It's unappetizing.

603
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:47,079
- Babe, ask them to move.
- I shouldn't have to.

604
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:49,124
- And I should be able
to enjoy dinner with my family

605
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,083
without feeling like the
whole world is out to get us.

606
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,737
- So you just want to pretend
it's not happening?

607
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,053
- I just want buying a suit
to be buying a suit.

608
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,888
- They're UV protected,
maintenance-free.

609
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,370
We can match the color
of any deck, any siding,

610
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,893
no matter what, guaranteed.

611
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,677
- Where have you been hiding
this one, Gayle?

612
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,375
- Just my secret weapon.
- Oh.

613
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:23,724
- Looking forward
to more, Dean.

614
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,291
- Yes, sir.
- Drinks on us next time.

615
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:28,076
- Next time we are drinking
to celebrate a big sale.

616
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,209
- Bye, you guys, drive safe.

617
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:32,994
All right?
- Thanks so much.

618
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,953
- What did I tell you?

619
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,911
I am serious.
You're a natural.

620
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,000
- Oh, I had
a pretty good teacher.

621
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,394
- Maybe it's about
making the right connection.

622
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,006
- Oh, thanks, man.

623
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,226
Oh, wait, I had the, uh
I had the gray Buick.

624
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:48,705
- Those are mine.

625
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,974
This is gonna be fun, huh?

626
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,453
- For sure.

627
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:02,241
- Hey, it's me.

628
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,417
I'm not trying to stalk you
or anything.

629
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,332
I'm just a little worried.

630
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,942
Um...

631
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,031
I hope I'm crazy,
and you and Marcus

632
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:13,252
are having fun somewhere.

633
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:18,561
Um...

634
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:22,087
call me or text me
or, um, whatever.

635
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:22,555
.

636
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,393
- How is that your breakfast?

637
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:35,916
- Savory sweet.

638
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,222
- Disgusting.

639
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,527
- It's like huevos rancheros.

640
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,181
- Except no huevos.

641
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,009
- And no rancheros.

642
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:44,054
- I'm a grown-up.
I can eat whatever I want.

643
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,578
Comprende?

644
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,712
- So he just showed up
with all of it?

645
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,366
- Minus his cut, yeah.

646
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,194
- We should've kept his share.

647
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:55,240
Show him who's boss.

648
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,459
- Easy to say when
you're not in the dark backyard

649
00:35:57,503 --> 00:36:00,158
with him
and his big old meat hands.

650
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,898
- So let's go divvy up.

651
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:04,249
- Yeah,
I'm gonna buy Ben a pony.

652
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,076
You know,
those really tiny ones?

653
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,730
- Does he want a pony?

654
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,863
- What kid doesn't want a pony?

655
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,822
- Girl, you have bills.
- I mean with the extra.

656
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:17,044
- Or instead of a pony...

657
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:19,525
we take this profit,

658
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:22,223
and we get more ones.

659
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,094
- And then what?

660
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:27,010
- We print more money.

661
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,187
- And then what?

662
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,666
- We make more.

663
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,929
- Yeah?
And then what?

664
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:35,236
- Whatever we want.
- Yeah.

665
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,501
- I mean,
it's what he would do.

666
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:40,937
Hmm?
- He wouldn't do that.

667
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,243
- You're jealous.

668
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,940
Here, you two can join
the syrup-on-your-face club.

669
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,507
- Don't get it
anywhere near me.

670
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:46,595
- Come on.

671
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,857
- I don't want it
anywhere near me.

672
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,119
- We're accepting new members.

673
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,469
- Yikes.

674
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,474
- Hey.

675
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,954
- Hey.
How'd you do?

676
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,869
- Well...

677
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,263
Some dude gave me a 20
to park his E-Class out front.

678
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,830
- Gross.
- Yeah.

679
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:08,051
- I horked in his water bottle
and stole all his change.

680
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,140
So how's my Nance?

681
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,491
- She keeps saying my name
to prove she's cool with it.

682
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:13,492
Hi, Ben.

683
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:14,797
How was school today, Ben?

684
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,277
- Would you like a boba, Ben?

685
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,192
- Boba Ben, Ben, Ben, boba?

686
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,759
- She's so woke.

687
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:22,327
-  Yeah, ever since
she got therapized.

688
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,503
- That whole thing
was so wrong.

689
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:26,287
- You know who I think
needs a therapist?

690
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:27,375
Therapists.

691
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:28,811
- Jenny's mom's a therapist.

692
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:31,988
- And she went to rehab
for Ritalin.

693
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,642
- Why are they
up your butt anyway?

694
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,427
You don't need a therapist.

695
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,863
- Thank you.

696
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,692
- You tell me everything.
I solve your problems.

697
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,263
- I-I mean, not everything.

698
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:49,658
- Good thing I'm free,
'cause you'd go broke.

699
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,493
- So how's this supposed
to work, anyway?

700
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,974
- Just talk about
what's bothering you.

701
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:03,672
- Yeah, but
what do people usually say?

702
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,021
- Well, most of my patients
are younger,

703
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:07,241
so lots of complaints
about brushing teeth,

704
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,288
going to bed early,
wanting more screen time.

705
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,336
- This is stupid.
I'm gonna go.

706
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,120
- Okay.

707
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:23,953
- Aren't you
gonna try to stop me?

708
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:26,129
- I can't help you
if you don't have any problems.

709
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:29,916
- Got a problem
with your attitude.

710
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,831
What else?

711
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:35,443
- Well, this bean-bag chair
kind of smells like pee.

712
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,271
- There is a reason for that.

713
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,415
- What else?

714
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:01,426
- Babe.
- Yeah?

715
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:04,254
- Was I like this
when you met me?

716
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:07,301
- No, you hid it better.

717
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,173
- You should've
checked references.

718
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:11,914
- Honestly,
I'm angry, too, babe,

719
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,569
but you just can't live
in it all the time.

720
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:17,224
- What if I found
a way to stop?

721
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:20,967
- Oh, yeah, sure, there's, um,
yoga, meditations,

722
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,578
church has got a bunch
of different fellowships.

723
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,673
- What if it was something
you wouldn't like?

724
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,114
But we wouldn't have to sit

725
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,290
next to the bathroom
ever again?

726
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:48,951
- I thought
we said never again.

727
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,389
- You look real good
in that suit.

728
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,392
- Nice.

729
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,002
- Pass this down to Daddy.

730
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,786
- Daddy gets the big piece.

731
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,135
- There we go.
- Nice.

732
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,485
- Here you go.

733
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:03,488
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

734
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,446
- I was defrosting a casserole.

735
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,708
- Oh, the kids wanted pizza.

736
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,058
- Yeah, come, uh
come sit down, have a slice.

737
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:10,582
- Come on, guys, help me out.
- Pass it, come on, let's go.

738
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,323
- I put you here next to Kenny.
Is pepperoni okay?

739
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:14,586
- Uh-huh.

740
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,978
- All right, team Boland,
check in.

741
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:17,719
How's everyone's day?
Thank you.

742
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:20,113
Oh, really?

743
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:21,897
Nobody has anything
to say at all?

744
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:23,638
- Ooh, I killed a frog
in science.

745
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,118
- Oh, that's gnarly.

746
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:28,817
- I finally made sense
of that pantry of yours.

747
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,340
- I had a pretty good day.

748
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:31,646
- Yeah?

749
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,910
- I got an opportunity
to make some real money.

750
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:36,782
They want to promote me
to manager.

751
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,262
- No way.
Yay, Mommy.

752
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,308
- Is that better than worker?
- Way better.

753
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,658
I get salary. I get commission
on every event.

754
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:45,181
That's awesome.

755
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:46,531
- They're even talking
profit sharing.

756
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:48,489
- What about the hours?

757
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,709
- Well, that's the best part,
because we'll be able to afford

758
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:54,190
help now and you don't have
to worry about us anymore.

759
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,976
- That is incredible.
Congratulations.

760
00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:00,849
And, you guys, how about we say
thank you to Nana?

761
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,068
- Thanks, Nana.
- Thank you, Nana.

762
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,766
- We couldn't have done it
without you.

763
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,514
Work.

764
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,820
- Cheers.

765
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,996
Thank you.

766
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,652
- Oh, my God,
I was worried about you.

767
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,784
And Marcus is okay?

768
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,789
No, no, no, no, no,
I totally get it.

769
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:32,707
Well, listen,
I've got your money,

770
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,797
and it's, like, totally burning
a hole in my pocket.

771
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,235
I know, but I'm not good
at this stuff.

772
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,762
Hey, you want to get a drink
or something?

773
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:46,939
Dean's mom is here, and it's,
like, this whole thing.

774
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,723
You're gonna die.

775
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,508
- Can I get you anything?

776
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,987
- I'll wait for my friend.

777
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,562
- She ain't coming.
