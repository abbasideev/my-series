1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,473
Hey. Hey.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,541
I got you one. Oh, wow.
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:05,779
Yeah. I'm just going
to grab some chips.

4
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:07,549
You want some? No, thanks.

5
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:09,283
We're still having
lunch today, right?

6
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:10,756
I guess.

7
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:16,263
How dare you.

8
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:32,911
Hey, Toby, what's this?

9
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:35,006
"I just want to remind everyone
about the company rules

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,712
"involving PDA, or public
displays of affection"?

11
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:41,414
Yes. Some people in the
office have complained...

12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,047
Oh, really? ...about
some other people

13
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:44,648
engaging in PDA,

14
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:48,321
and, you know, I just want to remind
that it's not appropriate to do that.

15
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:50,261
Is this about me and
Jan in my office?

16
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,561
Because I will have you know
that that was consensual.

17
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,899
What we did has nothing to
do with you or anyone here.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,598
I don't think anyone
heard anything.

19
00:00:58,673 --> 00:01:02,734
We were very discreet and most
people had left by that point.

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,801
Okay... So I don't think
it's any of your business.

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,371
What I think you should do is
roll up the memo real tight...

22
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:10,644
Okay, hey, look, the
memo was not about you.

23
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:14,620
For the record, I have never been involved
with anyone at work in any capacity.

24
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,884
All right, everyone. Look. It...

25
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,552
All right, the complaint
was about Jim and Pam.

26
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:21,654
So...

27
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:24,131
No way. What?

28
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,064
You guys are together?

29
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:28,292
Um...

30
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,129
Yep.

31
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:34,141
Yes, we are. Wow!

32
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,006
Tuna! Awesome!

33
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:37,374
- I knew it.
- You guys!

34
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,709
- To the two of you.
- Yes! Yes!

35
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,909
Toby, was this your fun little
way of congratulating us?

36
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:45,274
Yes.

37
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:47,821
Okay, mind is exploding.

38
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:49,914
Get over here. Come on.

39
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,516
Come here. Okay.

40
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,351
Okay, stand up.

41
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:56,696
Okay, here we go.

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,864
Everyone, this is a day
that will live in infamy,

43
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:09,503
because today is the day
that Jim and Pam become one.

44
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:11,169
Actually we've been dating
for a couple of months.

45
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:14,215
I love you guys so much.

46
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:22,520
Phone's ringing. No, no,
no, Pam, let them ring.

47
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,022
Let the bells of Dunder
Mifflin chime out your love,

48
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:31,861
because this is really good.
This is really good.

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,797
My heart soars with
the eagle's nest.

50
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:41,166
I don't see it. I think
they both could do better.

51
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:45,979
It's not a surprise to me.
Pam is the office mattress.

52
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:47,646
Jim Halpert's off the market.

53
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:51,344
Guess who just became the
best-looking single guy in the office?

54
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:27,312
Hey, can you make
that straighter?

55
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,053
That's what she said.

56
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,050
Did you plan that?

57
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,286
No.

58
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,027
"Can you make that straighter?

59
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,928
"That job looks hard.

60
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,263
"You should put
your mouth on that."

61
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:42,735
How can you even use
that one naturally?

62
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,665
Blowing up balloons, I thought.

63
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,969
"You might want to trim
it a little." Michael...

64
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,202
Oh, is Ryan coming back today?

65
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,545
Yeah, he is.

66
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,274
Oh.

67
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:57,307
Pam and Jim are together.
Ryan is visiting.

68
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,113
Only thing that could make
this day better is ice cream.

69
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,052
What do you want?

70
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,594
To give you this.

71
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,357
What is that?

72
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:11,898
It's a feral barn cat.

73
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,900
I trapped him last night
and I'm giving him to you

74
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,061
as a replacement cat
for the one I destroyed.

75
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:17,968
Her name was Sprinkles.

76
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,372
And his name is Garbage.

77
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,405
Mose calls him Garbage, 'cause
he likes to eat garbage.

78
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,605
Don't you, Garbage?

79
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:29,579
I can't believe you just thought
you could replace Sprinkles.

80
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,641
Before she's even in the ground.

81
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,243
You haven't buried her yet?

82
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,152
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.

83
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:38,659
Garbage can be very helpful, okay?
He's a useful cat.

84
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,422
He killed an entire family of raccoons.
Look at him.

85
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:44,727
I don't want Garbage.
I want Sprinkles.

86
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,236
Hey, Toby.

87
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,839
Hey, you two.

88
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:03,941
Hey.

89
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:06,350
So, now that we are dating,

90
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,912
we just wanted to know if
we had to sign one of those

91
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,254
"we're dating" things
for the company.

92
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:16,686
Oh, well, you know those are only
for, you know, "relationships."

93
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:20,491
So if this is just a casual
thing, there's no need.

94
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,126
Really. Oh.

95
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:25,969
Well, I won't speak for Jim,
but it's, like, pretty official.

96
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:29,707
Uh-huh.

97
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:34,142
Sorry, so do we need
to sign one or...

98
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:38,016
Let's just wait and
see what happens. Yeah.

99
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,681
What? Let's just wait.

100
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:43,217
Oh, okay. Okay.

101
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,417
Great.

102
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,928
Hey, Ryan, welcome back...
Hold on one second.

103
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:05,511
Hey, Pam, it's great to see you.
Is Michael in?

104
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,844
Yeah. MICHAEL: Hey. There he is.
There he is.

105
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,906
He's back and he's with a beard.

106
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:12,676
He has facial hair.

107
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:16,348
Look at him. All grown
up and no place to go.

108
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:19,791
Hello, Mr. Sonny Crockett.
I'm Tubbs.

109
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:21,790
Okay. Should we get started?

110
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:24,093
Oh, yeah, let's get
started because...

111
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:25,894
Yes, 'cause this is
very serious business.

112
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,298
Yeah. Exactly.

113
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:28,868
This is a business meeting.
Business meeting.

114
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,198
Fire guy. Stop that!

115
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,465
That's right.

116
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,063
- That's right. Fire guy.
- Oh, you scared me.

117
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,232
He's the fire guy.
Don't start any fires.

118
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:35,798
Fire guy.

119
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:36,969
You weren't here for that.

120
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:38,636
Here for what? When
he started the fire.

121
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:43,377
Look how big he is. Look at you.
You are so mature and old

122
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:46,682
and little man now. You're
like our little man.

123
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:47,948
Okay... Little old man-boy.

124
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,489
Michael, everybody...
With a beard.

125
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:50,888
- Bearded man-boy.
- Wow!

126
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,392
Let me say something. I know
I used to be a temp here,

127
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:54,985
but now everything is different.

128
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,587
I'd like your respect.
I am your boss now.

129
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,724
You're gonna have to treat me
the same way you treated Jan.

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,858
Oh, wow. So...

131
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:03,403
Mmm. That's a little kinky.
I don't swing that way.

132
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,200
Okay. Woo!

133
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:06,604
I think Ryan has
a gay crush on me.

134
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:10,371
Enough! Okay? This is inappropriate
and it stops right now.

135
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,181
Do you understand?

136
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:16,614
Yes.

137
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:18,675
Everybody, come on, settle down.

138
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:20,380
Let's get serious here.

139
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:24,151
Ryan has a very special
important presentation to do,

140
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,785
which we will be doing in the
conference room in 10 minutes.

141
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:29,853
Perfect. Sound good?
Okay. All right.

142
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,296
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me.

143
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:35,358
But there was this twinkle in his
eye that I picked up on, which said,

144
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:38,928
"Dude, we're friends. I'm
doing this for appearances.

145
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:40,701
"I am the big boss now,

146
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:43,938
"and I have to seem like
an ogre, but you know me

147
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:47,242
"and you trust me and
we like each other,

148
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:52,617
"and we'll always be friends and
I would never take you for granted

149
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,087
"in a million years.

150
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:58,717
"And I miss you,
man, and I love you."

151
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:00,891
His words.

152
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,970
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents
a floor-to-ceiling streamlining

153
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,299
of our business model.

154
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:13,237
The centerpiece of the campaign

155
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:16,242
is a new business-to-business
website interface

156
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,837
that will allow us to compete
directly with big-box chains.

157
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,506
Wait a second,

158
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:24,346
last time I checked, Dunder
Mifflin already has a website.

159
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:27,410
And quite frankly, I'm not
really sure what's wrong with it.

160
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:30,283
This is a massive overhaul.

161
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,258
We're getting younger, sleeker

162
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:35,454
and more agile with the way that
we adapt to the marketplace.

163
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,123
All essential personnel will be
issued BlackBerries for company use.

164
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,564
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

165
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:42,034
I'll stick around for a while to
help you set them up afterwards.

166
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:44,799
Any questions? Dwight?

167
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:48,433
What if we don't want to use a BlackBerry
because they are stupid and pointless?

168
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,737
This is company-wide, Dwight.

169
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,834
Got it.

170
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:52,071
Andy?

171
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:55,013
You should call it
Dunder Mifflinfinity.

172
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,116
You know, push the
words together.

173
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:58,674
Any other questions?

174
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,143
Kelly Kapour?

175
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:03,816
Can we speak privately
about our relationship?

176
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:05,050
Thank you, everybody.

177
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,718
Ryan Howard, everybody.

178
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:08,056
Good job.

179
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,359
That was some fun stuff.

180
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,624
When does the website go up?
As fast as possible.

181
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,430
We want to start
retraining people ASAP

182
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:17,334
so we can hit the ground
running with the new system.

183
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,770
Cool beans.

184
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,775
We're screwed. Who is?

185
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:23,867
Us. You and me. The old-timers.

186
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:26,137
I am not old. You are old.

187
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,976
You are, like, 100.

188
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,844
You're over 40.
That's the cut-off.

189
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,078
Are you listening
to what he's saying?

190
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:35,088
"Retraining," "new
system," "youth."

191
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:39,024
I'm telling you this kid is the
Grim Reaper. You deal with this

192
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:43,530
or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick
you hit with the car, we're goners.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,264
I swore I wouldn't
tell anybody this, but

194
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,733
in the interest of
revealing secrets...

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,809
Oh, my God, this is gonna
make your brain explode.

196
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,035
Dwight and Angela

197
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,603
dating.

198
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:02,478
Have been for six months.

199
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,780
No. Swear to God.

200
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,412
Oh, this is great. I was actually gonna
wait and tell you on your birthday,

201
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,955
but this is much more fun.

202
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,289
No, they have been dating
for, like, two years.

203
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,453
Since before your barbecue.

204
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,897
Wait, what?

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,262
You knew?

206
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:22,626
And you didn't say anything?

207
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,796
You didn't say anything to me.

208
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,268
Fair enough.

209
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:31,710
Wow. We should have started
dating, like, a long time ago.

210
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,837
Oh, sorry... Can
you believe that?

211
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,210
I didn't know you
guys were in here.

212
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,441
Oh, no. We're just sitting here.

213
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,541
I couldn't see your hands.

214
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:42,113
Hey, Pam, by the way, it's
great that you're dating.

215
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:47,217
But when a new client calls, you just have
to randomly assign them to a salesperson.

216
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:51,462
You can't base who gets new clients
on who you're sleeping with that week.

217
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,363
Okay? Okay.

218
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,698
Okay. Okay.

219
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,331
And that is why we waited
so long to tell people.

220
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:11,815
Okay, what's up?

221
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,649
Yeah, okay, I was just...

222
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:17,913
After the presentation I just wanted to
make sure that vis-à-vis me in the office,

223
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:19,619
everything is business as usual?

224
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:22,093
Well, it is business,
but not as usual.

225
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:23,790
Yeah, no, I understand.

226
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:28,460
We're making great strides, we're
updating, but business as usual, no?

227
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:32,165
No. We're throwing out the entire
playbook, we're starting from scratch,

228
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,366
we're implementing
a brand new system.

229
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,306
Good. So we're on the same page.

230
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,504
No, we're not.

231
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:46,977
Michael, I know exactly how much time
and manpower are wasted in this branch.

232
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:50,455
This company is getting younger,
faster and more efficient.

233
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:52,754
You need to prepare yourself.

234
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,557
We had a foreign exchange student
live with us when I was young

235
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,726
and we called him my brother and
that's what I thought he was.

236
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:06,873
And then he went home to what
is now formerly Yugoslavia,

237
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:10,544
taking all of my
blue jeans with him.

238
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:13,603
And I had to spend the
entire winter in shorts.

239
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,550
That is what Ryan is like.

240
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:19,848
A fake brother who
steals your jeans.

241
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:26,990
So, how are you?

242
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,495
Awesome. I am dating
a lot of guys.

243
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:32,061
Good. A lot. Black guys, mostly.

244
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:33,766
- Kelly.
- What?

245
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,796
Wait...

246
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,231
How do you touch just one
of these buttons at a time?

247
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:42,707
I don't know.

248
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,607
Did you even try?

249
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,271
If the kid wants to set
mine up, I'll let him.

250
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,010
I can't see half the things.

251
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,678
It's too little. Use the phone.

252
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:56,518
I want you to tell me that you
care about me. That is what I want.

253
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,421
Kelly, I'm your boss now, okay?

254
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:00,517
You can't keep talking to
me like I'm your boyfriend.

255
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:03,859
Oh, big strong man,
fancy new whatever.

256
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,193
I don't think you
ever cared about me.

257
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,358
I never cared about you?

258
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,401
Six months ago, Karen
Filippelli sent me an email,

259
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,902
asked me out, I said no,

260
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,631
because I was committed
to our relationship.

261
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:14,572
Well, I hope you're still
committed, because I'm pregnant.

262
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:20,439
And guess what, buddy?
I am keeping it.

263
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,879
Okay. Okay.

264
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,416
Do you feel prepared to
help me raise a baby?

265
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:26,681
I can't... I can't talk
about this right now, okay?

266
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:28,652
After work, we'll
go out to dinner.

267
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,519
We'll talk about it then, okay?

268
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:35,861
We have a date.

269
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,301
Hello. Hello, Dwight.

270
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,968
I've been thinking about things

271
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:50,434
and I wanted to know if you would
have dinner with me tonight.

272
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,603
Really?

273
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,873
Yes.

274
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:56,405
I'll make a reservation. No, no.
Let me cook for you.

275
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:59,281
Cauliflower and noodles.
Baked potato on the side.

276
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,583
I would prefer a public place.

277
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,189
See you after work.

278
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,256
Hi, Pam. Hi.

279
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,823
Is Michael in? In his office.

280
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,459
You can go right in. Okay.

281
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:16,594
Hey. Jan.

282
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,468
Ryan. Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

283
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:23,366
So, elephant in the room,
I have your old job.

284
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:28,012
Well, not exactly my job.
I mean, I had a different title.

285
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:31,313
Oh, well, excuse me. Same
office, same responsibilities.

286
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:34,320
Different salary. You'll get there.
Don't worry.

287
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:36,913
Well, you look great.

288
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:38,652
Thank you. Thank you.

289
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,694
Scranton suits you.

290
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,490
Best decision I ever made.

291
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,797
You were let go.

292
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,390
You know, I love the beard.
Keep it forever.

293
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:50,233
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:55,473
What is the actual deal with these
things in terms of testicles?

295
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,702
What?

296
00:14:56,777 --> 00:15:00,440
I don't want to grow weird sperm
in case we ever want to have kids.

297
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:04,081
So what's Ryan doing here?

298
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,517
Oh, I don't know.

299
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,782
They're launching a
big new business plan,

300
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,653
new website... Blah, blah, blah.

301
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,325
He's being a real
twerp about it, too.

302
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:19,526
It's all about youth and
agility and streamlining

303
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,295
and trying to squeeze
out the older people.

304
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:23,359
He's such a snake. Well...

305
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,803
I hope he gets hit
with an ageism suit.

306
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,307
What is that word?

307
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,899
Ageism?

308
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:34,208
Companies, they can't discriminate
against people due to old age.

309
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:37,273
Like a couple of years ago, we tried to
force out some of the older branch managers

310
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:38,875
with a mandatory retirement age.

311
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,681
And then Ed Truck,
your old boss,

312
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:43,814
threatened us with a lawsuit,
so we had to back off.

313
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:47,292
So older people have just as
many rights as younger people?

314
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,988
Yes, Michael.

315
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,258
They do.

316
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:16,015
Creed? Yes, sir.

317
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:18,948
Everything okay?
Everything's cool, dude.

318
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:22,256
I'm 30. Well, in
November, I'll be 30.

319
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,595
Is there another
meeting scheduled?

320
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,430
I was gonna do the
BlackBerry tutorial in here.

321
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:31,562
Michael told us to wait in here.
We don't know why.

322
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:36,071
Oh, man.

323
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,804
Good. We're all here.

324
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,607
We can get started. Michael.

325
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,170
Have a seat. We're
not doing this today.

326
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,738
Have a seat like everybody else.

327
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,443
Okay. This is...

328
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:46,076
It's still my office, Ryan.

329
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:57,861
Well, there has been a lot of
talk about new ideas today.

330
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:01,094
Well, new ideas are fine,

331
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,830
but they are also illegal

332
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:06,532
because they are
a form of ageism.

333
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,905
What? Yes. I am right.

334
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,573
Did you know that, "The age
discrimination in employment act of 1967

335
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:19,584
"prohibits employment discrimination
based on age with respect to employees

336
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:21,621
"40 years of age or older"?

337
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:22,848
I did.

338
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:24,618
Mmm. Technically, he's right.

339
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:25,783
Hey, shut up, Toby.

340
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,694
Look, why do we, as a society,
hate old people so much?

341
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:31,822
Because they're lame.

342
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:34,766
No! Creed, no, they are not.

343
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:39,295
In fact, many cultures
revere old people

344
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,841
because of their
storytelling ability.

345
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:43,706
Like the old lady from Titanic.

346
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:48,976
Or the funny things that they
can do, like, "Where's the Beef?"

347
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,017
Yeah? Why do you have
the Big picture up again?

348
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,813
You used that already
when you burned your foot.

349
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,319
Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.

350
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:57,414
I was going to put
up some new pictures,

351
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:00,460
but all of the ink in
the printer was gone.

352
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:01,954
Oh.

353
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,862
Michael Scott? That is me.
Come on in.

354
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,461
Who is this old fart?

355
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:11,903
Did you just stagger off the
street out of a box or something?

356
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,906
Who's this worthless
bag of bones?

357
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:18,502
Well, this guy is none other than one
of the founders of Dunder Mifflin,

358
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,513
Mr. Robert Dunder.

359
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,045
Huh? Oh, yeah.

360
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,211
Yes!

361
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:27,178
Hi, everyone. Michael, can
I talk to you for a second?

362
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:28,619
Sure thing.

363
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:30,683
Excuse me.

364
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,817
We have actual work to do.

365
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:35,259
Fine.

366
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:37,729
Then I will call David Wallace
and you can explain to him

367
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,097
why you threw the founder of the
company out on his ancient butt.

368
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:46,900
Bob, how old are you?

369
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:48,531
I'm 87.

370
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:51,077
87 years young.

371
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:53,704
And still active. That is great.

372
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,147
Did you know that Bob is still a
member of the board of Dunder Mifflin?

373
00:18:57,217 --> 00:19:00,914
Well, I haven't been to
a board meeting in years.

374
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:02,611
I send a proxy.

375
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:05,453
Ah! Still sends his own proxy.
Good for you.

376
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,420
I'm gonna live for
a very long time.

377
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:11,157
My Grandma Schrute
lived to be 101.

378
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,166
My Grandpa Manheim is 103,

379
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,794
and still puttering
around down in Argentina.

380
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,265
I tried to go visit him once,

381
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:21,432
but my travel visa was protested
by the Shoah Foundation.

382
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:25,178
I started this company in 1949.

383
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,269
Wow.

384
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:29,509
Back then it was an
industrial supplier

385
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,848
of metal brackets,
mostly, for construction.

386
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,216
Oh, boy.

387
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,653
And then Mifflin,

388
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,815
of course he killed
himself later,

389
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,724
uh, but I knew Mifflin
through the Rotary Club.

390
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:41,920
Great.

391
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:43,223
And he was...

392
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:47,358
He was at dinner with
Beverly and her husband...

393
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,129
What was his name?

394
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,230
Jerry. Jerry Trupianno...
I don't know.

395
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:56,572
...from South Jersey
and he was tall.

396
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:59,339
Both he and Mifflin
were tall guys.

397
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,541
Great. That's great.
Thank you for coming in.

398
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,243
Robert Dunder, everybody.

399
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:07,481
Thank you. That was wonderful.
Do you have a ride?

400
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,988
Well, I came here in a cab.
Perfect.

401
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:12,025
Could you get me that...
That's nice.

402
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:14,993
Inspirational. What
have we learned?

403
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:20,090
Well, we have learned that you
can't teach an old dog new tricks,

404
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,534
because it's illegal.
And you will go to jail.

405
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:25,230
I think that I should
help him get home.

406
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:27,967
No. No, don't help him.
He doesn't need help, Pam.

407
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,715
What a nice guy.

408
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:41,611
Good night, guys.

409
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:44,649
Well, today was a
fantastic waste of time.

410
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,716
I disagree. I think
it was very valuable.

411
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:50,251
Michael, technology helps business, okay?
You should not resist it.

412
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,729
This is the way the
world is moving.

413
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:54,733
I happen to think that the old
ways of doing business are better.

414
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,359
And I can prove it.

415
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:59,166
Okay. I look forward
to hearing your ideas.

416
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,632
Where do you want to go?

417
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,903
I don't know, someplace
romantic and expensive.

418
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,444
Kelly, come on.

419
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:06,570
You know what, you're right.

420
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:10,446
I'm feeling kind of nauseous, anyway.
So, you know, skip it.

421
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,924
Are you enjoying your
vegetarian noodles?

422
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:20,289
Very much.

423
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,393
How's your meat?

424
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:24,589
Dry. Delicious.

425
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:30,397
I heard a joke today.

426
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,131
Oh, that's funny.

427
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:34,640
Yes, it was.

428
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:41,007
Are you enjoying
your mineral water?

429
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:44,209
I can't do this.
I can't be with you.

430
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:49,647
Every time I look in your eyes I
see Sprinkles' stiff, lifeless body.

431
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:54,319
Then don't look in my eyes. Look
right here. It's an old sales trick.

432
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:57,830
I'm sorry. I gave this
everything I could.

433
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:00,162
No, please don't
do this, monkey.

434
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:03,396
I will leave your toothbrush on
top of your tire tomorrow morning.

435
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,873
Smell that.

436
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:14,311
Do you smell that?

437
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:15,405
Dry rot?

438
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:18,645
No, Dwight, that smells
like good business to me.

439
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:20,481
What I have done here
is I have collected

440
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:24,388
all the finest gourmet items
that Scranton has to offer.

441
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,255
Sweet, chocolate turtles.

442
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:29,386
Yes. No, no, those
are for our clients.

443
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,590
Actually, our ex-clients.
I'll explain later.

444
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:36,728
Ryan wants everything in our
company to be about emails and IMs,

445
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:41,740
but I think he is forgetting about
the original instant message,

446
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,111
letters attached
to baskets of food.

447
00:22:53,153 --> 00:22:56,213
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked
me to turn in these receipts

448
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,280
for these gift basket items.

449
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:00,349
Thank you. You're welcome.

450
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:04,558
Is that all? Yes.

451
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,296
I miss you.

452
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:10,962
Elevators.

453
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:14,265
Dwight, you have
to listen to me.

454
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:18,402
We are not seeing each other anymore.
Can you accept that?

455
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,179
Fine.

456
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:24,510
Then I just want to be friends.

457
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:25,608
Good.

458
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,245
Plus a little extra.
Also, I love you.

459
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,251
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

460
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:34,315
You don't? No.

461
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,089
You lied about being pregnant.
Right. So?

462
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:38,528
You really don't understand why
that might make me kind of angry?

463
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,862
No. We're never
getting back together.

464
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,196
Why not?

465
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:45,929
Hey.

466
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,598
Hey.

467
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:52,809
All right, I just have to
ask, now that we're public,

468
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:56,242
is the magic gone?

469
00:23:57,384 --> 00:24:00,444
It's funny you bring that
up because, yes, it is.

470
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:05,888
I knew it. Oh, man.
Just like that, huh?

471
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:10,020
I think, I mean, I don't
know what it is, but...

472
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:14,327
Be honest. I now
find you repulsive.

473
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,868
That's honest.

474
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:18,903
All right. Fair enough.

475
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:24,537
It was really fun while it
lasted, though, wasn't it?

476
00:24:24,611 --> 00:24:26,101
Yeah.

477
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:27,703
For me it was.

478
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,180
Okay.

479
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:30,511
All right.

480
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:36,415
Yeah.

481
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:38,821
Hey, boss, I didn't know
you were coming in today.

482
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:40,655
What is going on here?

483
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:41,887
I am glad that you asked.

484
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,793
Listen up, everybody.

485
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:48,459
In the last year, we have lost
seven clients to the big chains.

486
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:52,335
These gift baskets are our
ticket back into their lives.

487
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,736
We are going to show up

488
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:57,903
at these businesses unannounced
and we are going to win them back.

489
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:58,967
With gift baskets?

490
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,979
With peanut brittle,

491
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:06,108
with macadamia nut cookies,
with chocolate turtles,

492
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:11,722
with raspberry jam, and a
little bit of fat and salt.

493
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,483
Because you know what?
That's what people like.

494
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,324
Ever since I was a kid,

495
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:18,626
people have been telling
me that I can't do things.

496
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,495
"You can't be on the team.

497
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,398
"You can't move on
to second grade."

498
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:26,633
Well, now they're telling me
that I can't win back clients

499
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:29,038
using old-fashioned
business methods.

500
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,667
We'll see about that.

501
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:36,473
And FYI, I eventually aced second grade,
and I was the biggest kid in class.

502
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:42,845
Okay, we're gonna split up into teams.
Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me, Andy.

503
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:44,850
I'm not driving with him.

504
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:46,653
I'll go with you, Stanley.
Or him.

505
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:47,750
Why don't we just
go by ourselves?

506
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:51,194
Why don't we just go as teams
to demonstrate our teamsmanship?

507
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:52,356
Michael? Yes.

508
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:54,127
This is stupid. Well, that's...
Okay.

509
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,724
That's not helpful, Phyllis.

510
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:58,703
How is giving people gift baskets
going to get our clients back?

511
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,865
Gift baskets are
amazing, Phyllis.

512
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,636
Gift baskets are

513
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:07,980
the essence of
class and fanciness.

514
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:10,710
They are the ultimate present
that a person can receive.

515
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:12,911
What about cash? With cash
you can buy whatever you want,

516
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:16,854
including a gift basket. So,
it's kind of the best gift ever.

517
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,584
What about a gift
basket full of cash?

518
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:21,422
Yes. Cash basket.
Nice work, Tuna.

519
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:22,961
Fine. I'm just
gonna go by myself.

520
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:27,295
And I am going to win them back by
myself because this is important to me.

521
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:29,591
Michael, wait.

522
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:31,364
Let me go.

523
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:33,904
No, this is my quest.

524
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:36,373
Please. Let me go.

525
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:39,503
I need to win
those clients back.

526
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:41,104
Please.

527
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:42,443
Fine.

528
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:45,780
Then Godspeed to both of us.

529
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,548
Good luck, Michael.

530
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:50,885
We don't need luck.

531
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,925
Yeah. But thank you.

532
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:54,857
- That was really nice of you to say.
- Thank you.

533
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:57,453
Business to business,
the old-fashioned way,

534
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,930
no BlackBerries, no websites.

535
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:05,331
I would like to see a website
deliver baskets of food to people.

536
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,308
Yes, I understand that, David.

537
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,809
I just felt that if we
were to downsize Kelly

538
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:15,678
and then outsource customer service
to India, which a lot of companies...

539
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:19,049
Yeah. No. Yes, Kelly is Indian.

540
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,178
I understand that's confusing.

541
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:23,920
Hey, bro, I've been
meaning to ask you,

542
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,981
can we get some Red
Bull for these things?

543
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:30,155
Sometimes a guy's got to ride the bull.
Am I right? Later, skater.

544
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:35,891
Sweet ride. American-made.

545
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:37,334
What happened to the Sebring?

546
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:39,598
It is in the body shop.

547
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:42,707
I had to have the dent taken out
of the hood where I hit Meredith.

548
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:44,004
Oh, that's a pain in the ass.

549
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:45,169
I know.

550
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,042
So, who's next? Larry Meyers.

551
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:50,048
Left us six months
ago for Office Depot.

552
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:54,314
Proceed to the highlighted route,
then route guidance will begin.

553
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:55,786
Why do you use that thing?

554
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,720
It lets them know where
you are at all times.

555
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:58,985
Who?

556
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:03,119
The government, spy
satellites, private detectives,

557
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,421
ex-girlfriends.

558
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,302
Next night, I'm out at a bar, 2:00 a.m.
I figure I'll get a sandwich,

559
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:20,573
'cause you can get a sandwich
any time of the night,

560
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:22,274
I run into Vince Vaughn.

561
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,747
No way.

562
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:24,875
Literally.

563
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:27,613
Dude, you are so money,

564
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:30,554
but you don't even
know it, but you do.

565
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:33,817
Later, guys. Yeah.

566
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:36,020
Later, dude. Later, man.

567
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:43,166
Jim, how awesome is Ryan now?

568
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,568
Yeah. He's definitely something.

569
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,297
What does that mean?

570
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:50,672
That whole lifestyle, his whole
vibe, you find that appealing?

571
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,069
Tuna.

572
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:55,807
Tuna, Tuna, Tuna.

573
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:57,406
Tuna, Tuna, Tuna.

574
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:01,115
He has a killer job. He's rich.

575
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:05,055
He smells like what I think Pierce
Brosnan probably smells like.

576
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:07,718
He wears really cool
rich-guy clothes.

577
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:11,389
And he can get any
girl that he wants.

578
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:14,865
So, I'm sorry, Tuna, but if you
don't know why that's awesome,

579
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,226
then

580
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,267
you need awesome lessons.

581
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:21,500
Tuna, check you later.

582
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:25,237
'Cause he's so money that
he doesn't even know it.

583
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:27,711
Wow, those things are heavy.

584
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:29,880
There's a lot of stuff in there.

585
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:34,113
We have macadamia nut cookies,

586
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,718
the honey mustard pretzels.

587
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:39,622
Have you ever tried
focaccia crisps?

588
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:41,421
You know we closed our
account with you, right?

589
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,519
Yes. We do. We're
with Office Depot now.

590
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,223
Yes. Yes. Yes, we know.

591
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,596
But we just have not gotten over you.
Well...

592
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,727
And we are dedicated to providing you
with the very best customer service...

593
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:52,134
This is... ...the very best

594
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:54,799
personal business relationship...
That's exactly right.

595
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:57,434
...we can if you ever
decide to come back to us.

596
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,978
Okay. I don't think
we're coming back.

597
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,378
Please come back.
Okay, you know what?

598
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:04,177
Just enjoy the gift basket

599
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,742
and remember that we
provide a personal touch.

600
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,549
Remember what we had, Larry.

601
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,385
I mean, really,
it's about money.

602
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:13,584
Well, just enjoy
the gift basket.

603
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:15,921
Okay, thanks. All right.

604
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:17,895
I mean, their website's
really easy to use, too.

605
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,693
That's a big deal for us.

606
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,931
That guy was so...

607
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,104
How can they not know
how much better we are?

608
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:28,504
I don't know. Sometimes
people are just impossible

609
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:30,269
and they make you miserable.
That is true.

610
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:31,776
Like Angela in accounting.

611
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:33,038
Yes. She is nuts.

612
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:37,011
No, she's wonderful
at accounting.

613
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,244
But she drives me crazy.

614
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,579
Make the next right turn.

615
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:44,953
How do they know? How does
this know where to turn?

616
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,651
That's very impressive.

617
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:48,590
Hey, Pam,

618
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:51,926
I haven't settled on a final design
logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity

619
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:53,829
and I know you're
into graphic design.

620
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,460
Do you want to give it a shot?
Maybe try and design the logo.

621
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:58,197
Totally. Cool.

622
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,102
That would be great.

623
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:02,300
Can you do a couple mock-ups
and I'll take a look?

624
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,433
Yeah. Thank you very much.

625
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:04,533
Thank you. Cool.

626
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,702
Okay.

627
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:16,286
Yeah, I'm going to do some mock-ups
and then turn those into thumbnails,

628
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:20,324
maybe do some splash frames...

629
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:23,294
I don't know what I'm talking
about, but I'm excited.

630
00:31:23,663 --> 00:31:27,155
And the last guy says,
"No, hairy body."

631
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,666
You know, I have
heard it before.

632
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:31,898
Ah. Well, it's still very good.

633
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,563
I bet I know someone who
hasn't heard that joke,

634
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:37,108
your daughter Emily.

635
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:38,302
How's she doing?

636
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:40,812
She's great. Thanks for asking.

637
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,404
Great memory, by the way.

638
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:44,814
Is she gonna be,
like, 11 this winter?

639
00:31:44,884 --> 00:31:47,284
Wow. They grow up so fast.

640
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,945
I have a few of my own
that I want someday.

641
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,115
Listen, I don't want to
take any more of your time.

642
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:54,318
I know you're a very busy man.

643
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:56,862
The reason we have stopped
by is to drop you off

644
00:31:56,963 --> 00:32:01,923
this elaborate bag of goodies
and to ask you to reconsider.

645
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,400
Okay.

646
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:05,903
Okay. Okay. So
you'll reconsider?

647
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:07,934
Okay, thanks for the goodies.

648
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:08,996
Ah.

649
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,807
Is that all you have to say?

650
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:20,411
It looks delicious.
I don't know.

651
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:22,044
You don't know?

652
00:32:23,222 --> 00:32:26,350
Look, we want you back.

653
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:28,858
Can you offer lower prices?

654
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,088
Well, no.

655
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:31,357
Well, then, we're
not coming back.

656
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:32,830
He's not coming back.
It's over, Michael.

657
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,264
No, it's not. No, he's right.

658
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,925
No. Accept it. Why
would he come back?

659
00:32:36,002 --> 00:32:38,493
Why would he come back?
I will tell you, Dwight.

660
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:43,235
He would come back because we
offer a wide selection of products,

661
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:46,107
and because you're definitely not
getting the same sort of customer service

662
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:47,168
that you get with us, are you?

663
00:32:47,246 --> 00:32:48,440
That's not gonna
change his mind.

664
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:51,506
He's moving on. We had our
chance and we killed it.

665
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:57,984
Look.

666
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:03,660
We're also coming out
with a website soon.

667
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,594
It's a state-of-the-art thing.

668
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:07,656
It'll be up and running.

669
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:13,371
It's gonna cut costs, and it will
make ordering much, much easier.

670
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,805
Okay. Well, when it's
up, I'll check it out,

671
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,742
and if it really cuts costs,
maybe we'll come back.

672
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:22,036
Great. The magic
of the gift basket.

673
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:23,742
That I don't care about as much.

674
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:24,805
Let me know when the site's up.

675
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:26,977
Okay. Good.

676
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:31,120
Don't let Emily have any of the
Cajun almonds. She's allergic.

677
00:33:33,493 --> 00:33:35,461
Proceed straight.

678
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:37,519
Well, we're 0 for 6.

679
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:39,827
Last chance is the
Elmhurst Country Club.

680
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,364
Other side of the lake
on the southeast side.

681
00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:43,868
I don't get it.

682
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,871
I really don't get it.
I thought this would work.

683
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:49,638
I threw everything I had
at that guy and nothing.

684
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,973
That's how it goes
sometimes, you know?

685
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:55,411
You lose everything and
everything falls apart

686
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,278
and eventually you die

687
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,578
and no one remembers you.

688
00:33:58,651 --> 00:34:00,141
That is a very
good point, Dwight.

689
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:01,880
Make a right turn.

690
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:05,955
Wait, wait. No, no, no.
It means bear right.

691
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:08,960
No. It said right. It said take a right.
Up there.

692
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:10,222
No, no, no, look.

693
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:14,062
It means go up to the right,
bear right over the bridge

694
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,157
and hook up with 307.

695
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:17,065
Make a right turn. Maybe
it's a shortcut, Dwight.

696
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:18,160
It said go to the right.

697
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:19,261
It can't mean that.

698
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:20,305
There's a lake there! I think it

699
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:21,931
knows where it is going.
This is the lake!

700
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:23,202
The machine knows!
This is the lake!

701
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:24,675
Stop yelling at me! No!

702
00:34:24,744 --> 00:34:27,269
Stop yelling!
There's no road here!

703
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:31,546
Remain calm. I have
trained for this.

704
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,044
Okay.

705
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,916
Exit the window! Here we go.

706
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:37,649
Make a U-turn, if possible.

707
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:39,782
Look out for leeches!

708
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,384
Michael! Are you okay?

709
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:46,659
Swim for it! I got you.
I got you.

710
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,826
Oh, God.

711
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:51,870
Michael! Michael!

712
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:53,200
Let go. Let go of me.

713
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:54,466
Michael.

714
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:59,267
I got you! I got you!

715
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,442
Come on. Come on. Come on.

716
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,145
Come on.

717
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:32,376
You sure you're okay?

718
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:33,776
Fine.

719
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:37,145
Good. That is what's
most important.

720
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:40,349
Did you get the
rental insurance?

721
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:43,487
Because that is pretty important,
too, at a time like this.

722
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,831
What a disaster.
This whole thing.

723
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,659
I'll call a cab.

724
00:35:56,736 --> 00:36:01,435
These people just don't realize what a
gift basket means. They don't get it.

725
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,599
Look at that. Still works.
Old-fashioned cell phone.

726
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:06,839
Yeah. What about
that last guy, Aaron?

727
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:10,746
Boy, is he a jerk. I don't
even know if I want it.

728
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:12,977
"Their website is so easy."

729
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,715
Yeah, well, you can have
your technology, jackass.

730
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:17,847
Look where it got us.

731
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:20,289
Yes, we need a cab
at Lake Scranton

732
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,919
at the end of East
Mountain Road, in the lake.

733
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:24,223
Hang up.

734
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:26,726
You know what we're gonna do?

735
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,460
We're walking back.

736
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,263
We're walking back
to that office

737
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,772
and we're going to
reclaim our gift basket.

738
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,831
Yes. We're going to take
what's rightfully ours.

739
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:39,104
We're gonna take
a stand, Dwight.

740
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:42,746
We're gonna take a stand!
Take a stand!

741
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,346
So it plays on the infinity thing
without being obvious, you know?

742
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:46,942
Yeah. Definitely.

743
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:48,953
I'd love to do like
a color version,

744
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:51,182
just bring a little color to it.
I like it a lot.

745
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:53,316
It's clear and subtle
at the same time.

746
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:55,986
It's really good. You have a
real talent for this stuff.

747
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:58,622
Thanks. I'd love to talk
to you about it more.

748
00:36:58,698 --> 00:36:59,790
That would be great.

749
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:01,856
Do you want to go out
to dinner tonight?

750
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,625
Oh, is it...

751
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:06,467
Wear something nice. No.

752
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:07,631
What?

753
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:09,438
I just... I'm sorry.

754
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:10,941
I just want to have dinner.

755
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:13,677
I'm dating Jim.

756
00:37:15,114 --> 00:37:16,604
You're kidding.

757
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:21,549
We're together.

758
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:26,624
That's great. I...
That's awesome.

759
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,057
Yeah. Great.

760
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:33,888
So, let me... Yeah.

761
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:36,161
Let me look at these.
Okay. Great.

762
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:37,634
Cool. Great.

763
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:49,604
I guess he can't get
any girl he wants.

764
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,791
Did you forget something?
What happened to you guys?

765
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:03,294
Give it back.

766
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:07,025
The gift basket. Give it back.

767
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,157
Oh, what is this?

768
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:09,428
It's real simple.

769
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:13,438
If you don't appreciate what we
do, then give us back our basket.

770
00:38:13,506 --> 00:38:15,565
Maybe you should leave.

771
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:17,802
Yeah. Maybe we should...

772
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:20,004
Maybe we should leave.
Come on, let's leave.

773
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,171
But before we leave,

774
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:26,014
my wet friend and I are gonna wait
for our cabs on your nice couches.

775
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:29,282
Can you call us a cab, please?
I'm gonna... Sorry.

776
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:31,084
My clothes are so wet.

777
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:32,522
Nice leather.

778
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:35,059
Oh, my shoes are so muddy.

779
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:37,721
All right, here you go.
Take it back.

780
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:39,424
It's been opened.
Yeah, it was mine.

781
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:42,899
What's missing? The turtles.

782
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:44,191
Summer sausage. Where
are the turtles?

783
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,261
Where are the turtles? Come
on, guys, get out of here.

784
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:51,105
Where are the turtles?
Where are they?

785
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:52,235
Excuse me, I have an
announcement to make.

786
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:55,280
We seem to be missing a box of
chocolate turtles with pecans

787
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:57,907
and we will not be leaving the
premises until we obtain them.

788
00:38:57,983 --> 00:39:01,419
Hand over the turtles now!

789
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,956
I ate them, okay? I ate the turtles.
They're gone.

790
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,794
We'll bill you.

791
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:25,143
May I have your
attention, please?

792
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:29,204
This office will not be using
any new technology ever.

793
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,408
Starting now. That
is not correct.

794
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:35,921
Ryan thinks that technology is the answer.
Well, guess what?

795
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:37,956
I just drove my car into a lake.

796
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,217
You did what?

797
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:43,352
I drove my car into a lake.

798
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,463
Why, you may ask, did I do this?

799
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:49,763
Well, because of a machine.

800
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:54,397
A machine told me to drive into a lake.
And I did it.

801
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:58,876
I did it because I trusted
Ryan's precious technology.

802
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:00,070
And look where it got me.

803
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,169
Into a lake.

804
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:02,271
Exactly.

805
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:04,316
Did you get any clients back?

806
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,542
Maybe. Maybe not.

807
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:07,916
Time will tell.

808
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:11,351
But I will tell you one
thing, those gift baskets

809
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:14,085
never endangered
anybody's lives.

810
00:40:17,963 --> 00:40:19,590
Game, set, match.

811
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:24,762
Point. Scott. Game over.

812
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,267
End of game.

813
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:42,220
Everyone always
wants new things.

814
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:46,657
Everybody likes new
inventions, new technology.

815
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:49,990
People will never be
replaced by machines.

816
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:54,328
In the end, life and business
are about human connections.

817
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:59,732
And computers are about trying
to murder you in a lake.

818
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:02,734
And to me the choice is easy.

819
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:10,272
I'm not saying I had a
meteoric rise, but I did.

820
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:14,851
And if they knew how much I
was paying for my haircut now,

821
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,115
they wouldn't be
giving me a noogie.

822
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:19,655
It was $200.
