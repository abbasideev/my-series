...is hurry up and die.

175
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,179
I wanna see my grandfather.

176
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:59,345
Hey. EDUARDO: Hey.

177
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,691
It's me, Miguel, and Eduardo.

178
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:08,456
Hey.

179
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,716
Eduardo, your son.

180
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:14,561
-Miguel, grandson.
-Hey.

181
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,710
Hey.

182
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,433
Hey, hey, hey.

183
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,659
You know what we should do
with Ricardo Alvarez?

184
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:30,972
What's that?

185
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,830
Let him go free.

186
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:40,974
RICARDO: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

187
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,773
Let him go free?
The man is a convicted killer.

188
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:47,221
MUKADA: He stabbed the inmate
who cut his son's tongue out.

189
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:49,057
-And he's old.
-He's old, Leo.

190
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:51,139
Old doesn't necessarily mean nice.

191
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,043
If there's any doubts about that,

192
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,341
spend ten minutes with my mother-in-law.

193
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:59,485
Leo, a 31-year-old inmate
costs $21,000 a year to maintain.

194
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,934
A senior costs three times that amount.

195
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,322
Since when did you get so interested
in the budget?

196
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,573
Since I figured out
that the money we're gonna waste

197
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,284
taking care of Ricardo Alvarez
could be put to much better use.

198
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,371
Besides, Ricardo doesn't know
where he is or even why he's here.

199
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,969
There is such a thing
as criminal menopause, right?

200
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:17,199
Look, he cannot commit the crime again.

201
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,127
The man is no longer a threat to anybody.

202
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:22,214
It doesn't change what he did,
and it doesn't change his sentence.

203
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:24,255
Life imprisonment means just that.

204
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,843
Besides, if he really doesn't know
he's in prison,

205
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:29,362
then he's already free, isn't he?

206
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:37,435
When I was growing up,
both my father and my grandfather

207
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,319
came to Oz.

208
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,401
You know, when I was little,
I always wondered

209
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:46,971
what was so great about prison that
they'd wanna leave us and come here.

210
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,915
But you're a kid, you know.
What do you know?

211
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:53,515
REIMONDO: Yeah.

212
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:57,042
So the word "grandfather."

213
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,452
What does the word
mean to you, emotionally?

214
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:03,389
Nothing.

215
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:05,664
Don't mean nothing at all to me.

216
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,300
"Pizza" means more.

217
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,769
"Doorknob."

218
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:16,523
Would you like "grandfather"
to mean something to you?

219
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,742
Yeah.

220
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:25,054
Dr. Nathan's not sure how long
your grandfather has to live.

221
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,784
Look, since your father's an orderly
in the prison hospital

222
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,327
and is gonna spend time
with your grandfather,

223
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:35,370
there's no reason
you can't do the same thing.

224
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,650
Maybe if you take care of him,

225
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:40,225
you'll learn to care for him.

226
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,261
You know, in my family,

227
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:48,384
Ricardo was like a god.

228
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,272
You know, he was a legend.

229
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,844
My grandmother used to show me
these pictures,

230
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:55,695
you know,
telling me stories all about him.

231
00:14:56,851 --> 00:15:00,128
And I wanted to be like him, you know.

232
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:01,837
Yeah.

233
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:07,288
Now I see he's just a man.

234
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:09,935
You know, he's just an old man

235
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,426
and he's rotting away.

236
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:16,048
I don't wanna end up like my grandfather.

237
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:18,201
You don't have to, Miguel.

238
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:20,173
Oh, really?

239
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:24,374
Well, I don't see it going down
any other way.

240
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,280
Rebadow.

241
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:40,136
Hey, I'm sorry you didn't make it out.

242
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:42,782
It's okay. It was worth it.

243
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,449
The adrenaline rush.
I felt 25 again for a moment.

244
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:54,264
-Here's your dinner.
-I don't want it.

245
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,011
Okay.

246
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,127
What do you want?

247
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:03,455
I'd like a few years at the end of my life
to be free.

248
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,217
HILL: <i>Do we care for people
when they're sick</i>

249
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:15,656
<i>because we actually care about them?</i>

250
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,640
<i>Or do we care for them
because when our time comes,</i>

251
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,808
<i>we want someone to care for us?</i>

252
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,157
<i>Or does it matter?</i>

253
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,620
<i>At least you got your health.</i>

254
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,933
Don't you hate it when people say that?

255
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,157
I mean, you lose your job,
you lose your wife, you're in prison,

256
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:42,288
and some punkass dude gonna say,
"At least you got your health."

257
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,498
Like that's supposed to
make you feel better.

258
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:47,710
So what if I'm broke, or if some
drug dealer wants to cap my ass?

259
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:49,244
At least I ain't got a tumor.

260
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:52,739
I swear, the next person
that says ALYGYH to me,

261
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,999
I'm gonna make sure they ain't got
their health much longer.

262
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:01,024
You say you were having nightmares.
Can you remember any of them?

263
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:03,507
No. Ow!

264
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,167
What's the matter?

265
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,146
My tooth hurts.

266
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:09,387
It's been hurting for a week.

267
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,481
-Then go see a dentist.
-No.

268
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:15,128
-Why?
-I hate the dentist.

269
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:18,203
All dentists,
or just Dr. Kochurn in particular?

270
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,364
The concept of dentists.

271
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,689
Then what?
You prefer the concept of pain?

272
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,405
Make an appointment, Groves, okay?

273
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,107
Okay?

274
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:33,013
DENTIST: Oh, God.
-What?

275
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:36,566
Oh, sweet Jesus,
Donald Groves is coming in to see me.

276
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:40,115
-So?
-Gloria, he ate his parents.

277
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,545
I'm not sticking my fingers in his mouth.

278
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,361
My fingers are my livelihood.

279
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,559
He's been working in the ward
as an orderly.

280
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:47,838
He seems harmless.

281
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:49,980
So you'd stick your fingers in his mouth?

282
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,738
If I had to.
If he's in pain, you have to.

283
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,367
-No, I don't.
-What about the Hippocratic Oath?

284
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:57,702
Dentists don't take the Hippocratic Oath.

285
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,101
We don't make any promises to anybody.

286
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,868
DENTIST: How's that gas working?

287
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,634
You feel happy?

288
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,023
-Calm?
-Uh-huh.

289
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,646
Good.

290
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,635
Okay, let's have a look.

291
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,561
Open your mouth.

292
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,192
Wider. Wider. Wider.

293
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:26,772
-I can't get any wider.
-Alrighty then.

294
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,186
They look fine.

295
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:31,896
-It hurts.
-It's probably nothing.

296
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,330
-It hurts.
-Don't be a baby.

297
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:36,122
-Who you calling a baby?
-Nobody.

298
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,796
Forget it. Forget I said anything.

299
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:45,242
Aha, there is a tooth that's rotted out.
So we're going to have to pull it.

300
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,788
That means I have to take a needle,
inject some novocaine in your mouth.

301
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:50,670
-I hate needles.
-Everybody does.

302
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,749
-Then I have to drill.
-I hate drills.

303
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:55,842
Right now, so do I.

304
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,009
Right now, I wish there were
holistic dentistry.

305
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:00,570
I'm in pain.

306
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:03,637
Well, you're going to be in a lot more
before we're finished.

307
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:06,361
But after that,
you won't have any pain, see.

308
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,792
If I cause you pain, it's not my fault,
so don't bite my head off.

309
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:12,782
I mean...

310
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:16,771
-I know what you mean.
-Okay.

311
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:21,060
Let's get started. First, the novocaine.

312
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,611
Open wide.

313
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:31,600

314
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,929
could you give me a hand here, please?

GROVES:
This is my tooth. It was in my head.

316
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,308
This tooth and I have been together
since we were kids.

317
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:54,267
This tooth chewed on my mom.

318
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,421
You should sell it.

319
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,491
-Sell it?
-Sell it.

320
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,571
Tooth from the mouth of Donald Groves?

321
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,407
Know how much that's worth on the market?

322
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,562
-How much?
-Plenty.

323
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:11,155
-Who'd wanna buy my tooth?
-Collectors.

324
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:12,971
-Collectors?
-Collectors.

325
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,356
People collect everything.

326
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,856
Stamps, salt and pepper shakers,
World's Fair tchotchkes.

327
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,161
Some people collect crime stuff.

328
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,856
Lindbergh ladder,

329
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,241

330
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,626
and this.

331
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,280
We'd have to get a fence, right?

332
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,942
We're in prison.
How hard's that gonna be?

the both of us only got one goal in mind,

-We kill them, the mob kills us.
-They won't know.

As long as we make it fine,
he won't be able to taste it.

525
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:20,355
Over time,
the glass will cut his insides up.

526
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:23,841
-And he'll die slowly.
-Painfully.
