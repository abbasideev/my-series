Said,

707
00:45:29,488 --> 00:45:32,640
I grew up in a small town
in upstate New York.

708
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:35,141
There was only one major industry there.

709
00:45:35,452 --> 00:45:36,522
The prison.

710
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,122
Everybody's parents
either worked at the prison

711
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:41,402
or made a living from, you know,

712
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:44,341
motels, gas stations,

713
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,184
or, like my dad, had a diner.

714
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:49,463
Right across the street.

715
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,510
It was the fall.

716
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,399
We'd just gone back to school.

717
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:56,849
I was about to turn 100,

718
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:59,371
so I was very, very excited.

719
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:02,598
A few days before my birthday though,

720
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:05,232
there was this riot.

721
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:08,638
And it lasted four days.

722
00:46:09,278 --> 00:46:12,634
But then the governor
authorized 2,500 troops,

723
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,788
state troopers,

724
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:18,920
to go back in, take it back.

725
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:21,514

727
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:28,513
So when the tear gas cleared,

728
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:33,303
31 inmates and nine hostages were dead.

Instead of going to a birthday party,

732
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:49,641
I went with my family
to a, uh, memorial service.

733
00:46:50,027 --> 00:46:52,541

742
00:47:16,678 --> 00:47:19,909

743
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:22,253

Now, I am not saying that the men
in Oz are innocent.

749
00:47:39,118 --> 00:47:42,078
I'm saying they are not here because of
the crimes that they committed,

750
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:44,112
but because of the color of their skin,

751
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:48,207
their lack of education,
the fact that they are poor.

752
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:51,555
You see, this riot is not
about getting smoking back,

753

it's not even about life in prison.

754

It's about society taking responsibility.

755

bigger prisons, better prisons.

We don't wanna know who they really are.

869
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:09,659
Because then it might hit
too close to home.

870
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:12,661
And home is what it's all about, right?

871
00:55:12,987 --> 00:55:14,944
Making a home no matter where you are,

872
00:55:15,198 --> 00:55:16,677
no matter who you are.

873
00:55:16,908 --> 00:55:20,264
At the end of the day,
everybody wants somewhere to rest,

874
00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:22,774
somewhere to lay their bones,

875
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:25,838
even if it's in a land called Oz.

876
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:28,094
Yeah.

877
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:32,497
Like Dorothy says when she wakes up
in her own bed back at Aunt Em's:

878
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:35,237
"There's no place like home."

879
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:39,765
There's no fucking place like home.
