1
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:09,125
Yeah.

2
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,045
<i>♪ Is that you? ♪</i>

3
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:20,405
Oh!

4
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:21,485
<i>♪ Is that you? ♪</i>

5
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:24,125
I’ll get the light.

6
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:26,285
<i>♪ Is that you now? ♪</i>

7
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,325
- Come on!
<i>- ♪ So sweet... ♪</i>

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,405
Aah... Oh!

9
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:32,205
- Where've you gone?
- I'm up here!

10
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:33,885
Mm!

11
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,085
- Oh, yeah. Let me get on top.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:37,405
- Ooh!
- Ow!

13
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,325
- Where's your head? Oh!
- Um...

14
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,821
- Oh! My balls! You're on my balls!
- Oh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

15
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,565
- Right, I'm gettin' the light.
- No, don't!

16
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:47,845
- Oh, my neck.
- Oh!

17
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,405
- Oh!
- What the fuck?

18
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:51,805
You dirty bastard.

19
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:09,045
So, when Clara says she doesn't think
you want to have sex with her anymore,

20
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:10,885
how does that make you feel?

21
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:13,765
Bad.

22
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,845
Descriptive words, Tim?

23
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,485
Um...

24
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,965
Really bad.

25
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,645
All right, Clara,
I'd really like to see you focus

26
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:28,125
on what you're actually feeling.

27
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:34,965
<i>Hello.</i>

28
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,485
Hello. Hm.

29
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:39,405
Hello.

30
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,085
My name is Milburn.

31
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:43,205
I am a sex therapist.

32
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:45,925
How do you feel?

33
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,605
How do you...

34
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:49,605
feel today?

35
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:57,445
- I'm just trying to...
- Just trying to what?

36
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:59,365
- Air our dirty underpants, is that it?
- No!

37
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:01,845
So, it's rom-com night.

38
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:05,845
I'm thinking 1980s Julia Roberts
or early noughties Kate Hudson.

39
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,845
- What's your preference?
- Mum, what...

40
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:10,485
What makes a good therapist?

41
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,125
Just curious.

42
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:14,365
Well...

43
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,845
I guess some therapists get into it
for the wrong reasons.

44
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,445
They do it for money or status.

45
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:23,885
They think of it as a...
career rather than a vocation.

46
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,325
But it... it's just a job.

47
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:26,885
Sure.

48
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:30,805
A job where one wrong word
could trigger a nervous breakdown,

49
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,045
resulting in decades of emotional damage.

50
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:36,885
A good therapist, a, you know...
a "good" therapist,

51
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,085
I guess understands
the weight of that responsibility.

52
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,485
- That sounds intense.
- Well, it's a fine balance,

53
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,005
listening to people

54
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,485
without inserting yourself
into their reality.

55
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:49,805
So it's not about you.

56
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,405
Mm. Exactly.

57
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:56,645
And more importantly,
Roberts or Hudson?

58
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,605
Um... Roberts.

59
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:02,485
Okay. Roberts it is.

60
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,245
You're wearing a tie.

61
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:13,605
Yeah, I suppose I am.

62
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,965
It’s Aimee G’s house party tonight.

63
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:18,645
Yeah, and?

64
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:22,565
And? Apparently, last time,
Warhammer Tom drank 14 Jägerbombs

65
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,085
and nearly drowned in her hot tub.

66
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,165
We need an invite!

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,765
I thought you’d given up on sixth form.

68
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:30,405
- You have the memory of a goldfish.
- An eternally optimistic goldfish.

69
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:31,365
Who's that?

70
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,405
- Oh, hello, Otis!
- Hi.

71
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:37,885
It's one of my mum’s
recent conquests.

72
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,525
Poor guy.

73
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,245
Hello...

74
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:50,365
- Harry.
- Harry. Sorry. I'm bad with names.

75
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:54,125
- Wha... What can I do for you, Harry?
- Well, I was just passing through.

76
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,765
I thought maybe we could pop
and get a bit of breakfast together.

77
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,501
I... I had a good time the other night.

78
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,885
It's so rare to find a woman
who really listens, you know.

79
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:01,965
I see.

80
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,165
I'm about to teach a vagina workshop.

81
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,365
So... no?

82
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:11,445
- How about tonight then? Dinner?
- I've got plans tonight.

83
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,485
- Sometime this week?
- Look, Harry,

84
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:16,045
I'm really sorry
if I gave you the wrong impression.

85
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,685
I'm not interested in dating anyone.

86
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,365
I'm extremely busy with work
and raising my son,

87
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,005
and I just have no room in my life

88
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,325
for the kind of intimacy
that you are clearly craving.

89
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:29,365
But I really commend you
on your directness and your bravado

90
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,685
and I really hope that you find
what you're looking for.

91
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,405
Goodbye, now.

92
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,885
You're particularly odd today.

93
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,645
Who is it?

94
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:08,045
- Hi.
<i>- Hey, it's Maeve.</i>

95
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,325
<i>- </i>Maeve, hi.
<i>- We need to talk.</i>

96
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:10,365
Yes...

97
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,445
Uh...

98
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,005
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Help.

99
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:15,741
- Maeve Wiley is calling you?
<i>- Hello, Otis?</i>

100
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,085
- Yes. No!
- Why would you not...

101
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:18,661
- No, no, no!
- Why aren't you excited?

102
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,565
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Put it down!

103
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:20,925
- What are you...
<i>- Hello?</i>

104
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,125
Okay...

105
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:25,565
Uh, explain?

106
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:29,005
I did something stupid. Maeve asked me
to set up this sex therapy thing

107
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:32,245
to help students with their problems,
for money, and I agreed,

108
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,165
and I'm thinking I shouldn't have,
'cause I'm all confused, and... and hot.

109
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,485
- She wants you to be a sex therapist?
- Yes.

110
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,845
- But you can't wank!
- I know, and I'm 16 years old,

111
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,285
and I feel clammy...

112
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,725
- I'm all dizzy and hot.
- Okay, okay. Okay, take a chill pill.

113
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,165
So think about it. This could be awesome.

114
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:51,845
A sex therapist.

115
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,445
Listen, knowledge is power,
power is status,

116
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,165
and status means popular.

117
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:58,245
- You can be popular.
- I don't want to be popular.

118
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:01,205
I just want be a guy in the corner
that no one knows, you know?

119
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,685
And they say, "Who’s that guy?"

120
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:04,605
And they go,
"He's just a guy in the corner."

121
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:06,005
Wait, you wanna be in a corner?

122
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,445
- Yes.
- Otis!

123
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,765
Man, are you really saying you don't wanna
hang out with Maeve Wiley?

124
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:18,365
- But she's not popular, she's scary.
- Yeah, exactly.

125
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,565
She's better than popular,
because she's cool.

126
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:21,925
And she’s the best kind of cool,

127
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,845
because no one in this place
even knows it yet.

128
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,965
But you don't wanna hang out with her.
I get it.

129
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,685
I think I wanna hang out with her.

130
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:35,525
Yes. I don't know, maybe.

131
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,885
- I don't know.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh. Of course you do.

132
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,325
Now lose the tie. You look like a Mormon.

133
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:43,325
Listen, you're gonna have to fake it
until you make it.

134
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,125
Can you do that?

135
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:49,085
Yes.

136
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,085
Okay. Now let's get on with our day.

137
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,325
Hey, piss-flaps.

138
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:56,661
- Something wrong with your phone?
- I don't have a phone!

139
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:59,165
- What? I do. It's broken, right?
- Mm-hm.

140
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,925
The reception. I need to get it fixed
at the Carphone Warehouse.

141
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,565
Thank goodness for insurance. Whew!

142
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:05,045
Stop speaking.

143
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,085
Found us a client.

144
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,245
Okay. Whew! Great, fantastic.

145
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,325
Meet me in the toilets at break
for the session.

146
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:13,725
Sorry. Wait. Break? Today?

147
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,365
Yeah. Is that okay?

148
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:20,725
Yes.

149
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,885
Um...
We've never officially met. I'm, um...

150
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,885
I'm Eric, his <i>numero uno,</i> so to speak.

151
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:30,525
Your buttons are done up wrong.

152
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,565
It's a new look. It's like normcore...

153
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,245
but with buttons done up wrong.

154
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,445
How fabulous.

155
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:40,245
Don't be late.

156
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,605
Oh, my God!
We just spoke to Maeve Wiley!

157
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,045
Oh, my God!

158
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,765
Okay, we need to go.
We need to go now. Now!

159
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:54,125
- Good morning, ass bandit!
- Sorry, Adam.

160
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,005
Mum says I can't hang out
with you anymore.

161
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:58,445
Why not?

162
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:02,365
She says you're...
you know, a... a sex pervert.

163
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,205
See ya at Aimee's party, man!

164
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:13,885
Remember, all of these chemicals
are highly flammable, okay?

165
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:16,461
Sir, we did this experiment
last year with Mr. Moorhouse.

166
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,781
Well, then, you'll be a expert,
won't you, Trimble?

167
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:21,565
Just get on with it, please. Thank you.

168
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,205
We're finished, Adam.

169
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:48,061
- Fake it till I make it. Fake it...
- Think of someone strong.

170
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,245
- Like Putin. Or Beyoncé.
- What'd you bring him for?

171
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,085
Uh, where he goes, I go.

172
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,805
Ugh. Whatever. She's in there.

173
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,005
Gag reflex problems.
She vommed on her boyfriend's penis.

174
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,965
Scandalous.

175
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,485
Um...

176
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,925
- Do I have to look at her?
- No.

177
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,325
Think of it like confession.

178
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:06,965
What are you waitin' for?

179
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,845
- No.
- Sorry! Sorry.

180
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,965
Right...

181
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:25,605
Hello?

182
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,965
Hello, I'm your therapist today.

183
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,845
- How... might I serve you?
- This is weird.

184
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,645
- Can't we just talk face to face?
- No, we shouldn't see each other.

185
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:39,125
How can... How can I help you?

186
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:41,765
Didn't Maeve tell you?
I just... I don't wanna say it again.

187
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,125
Yes! Yes, you, uh...

188
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:46,885
You encountered some problems
during fellatio,

189
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,525
which resulted in you experiencing
a bout of emesis, correct?

190
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:52,765
- Emesis?
- Uh, vomiting.

191
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:56,885
Yeah, I puked on his dick, all right?
He says I shouldn't give BJs anymore.

192
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,245
But if I don't go down on him,
he won't go down on me.

193
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,445
So what do I do? What do I do?

194
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,205
Well...

195
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:08,445
human sexuality is far more varied
than you might realize,

196
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,565
and each person
has a history of unique experiences,

197
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,685
which translates into their connection
with a chosen sexual partner,

198
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,325
or, indeed, partners.

199
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:19,965
- What?
- Well,

200
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:23,685
did you know that humans are not
the only species to perform fellatio?

201
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:26,381
- Bats have been know to partake...
- What do bats have to do with this?

202
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:29,085
Well, at the zoo,
I once saw a chinchilla fellate itself...

203
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,245
Hello?

204
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,005
Oi, you forgot to pay.

205
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,805
I am not paying for that psycho in there
to take the piss.

206
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,005
I don't know why I trusted you
in the first place.

207
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,845
- Uh...
- Oh!

208
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:46,725
- You owe me.
- Whatever, slag.

209
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,885
What the hell did you do?

210
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:49,965
Um...

211
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:53,165
I might have said something
about chinchillas giving blow jobs.

212
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:54,885
I'm sorry, I got nervous.

213
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:56,725
You give advice, not traumatize people.

214
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,981
Okay, well, I was going to say
that to properly identify

215
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,925
why she experienced emesis
during fellatio,

216
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,981
I would need a more accurate understanding
of her social and sexual history.

217
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:05,005
But she left.

218
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,165
- What the hell is emesis?
- You know, vomiting!

219
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,901
That poor girl just wanted to know
how to suck a dick.

220
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:14,285
Well, thing is, I don't think I'm
very good at this whole therapy thing.

221
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,405
That’s not true. I've seen you do it.
You're like some sort of...

222
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,405
strange sex savant.

223
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,405
It's weird, but impressive.

224
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,605
We need to find some more clients.

225
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,421
And you need to work
on your delivery skills.

226
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:28,045
Try speaking like a normal 16-year-old
next time, all right?

227
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,965
Let's hope Olivia doesn't tell anyone.

228
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,685
She's really disappointed in you.

229
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,245
Hey, Maeve! I wanna fuck a chinchilla.
Can you help?

230
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:44,685
- Yeah, I think she may have told people.
- Ow!

231
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,525
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

232
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:48,765
Ah! Kelly Clarkson! Poet.

233
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:51,205
- Nietzsche.
- I'm all right!

234
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:54,045
How does your mum get clients, then?

235
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,165
Word of mouth, I guess.

236
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,645
Client testimonials.
But we've only had one other client.

237
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,125
Any other ideas?

238
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,365
You know the pretzel place
in Pineland Shopping Center?

239
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:10,165
They give you a free sample,
what do you do?

240
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,005
You buy a pretzel, obviously!

241
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,765
People don’t trust your product
because they haven't tried it yet.

242
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,485
- Product samples.
- Ah!

243
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:21,165
That's actually a good idea.

244
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:22,565
What you doing tonight?

245
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,821
Watching a selection
of Julia Roberts movies with my mum.

246
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,205
Hah! He's kidding. Why do you ask?

247
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:30,325
We need to go somewhere
teenagers have a lot of sex.

248
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,925
The bushes behind Science Block A?

249
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,605
Aimee’s house party.

250
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:38,325
Put your good shirts on, boys.

251
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,085
It's party time.

252
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:46,725
- We just got invited to a party!
- Ssh!

253
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,885
- An invite! An invite!
- I know!

254
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:56,165
- How do I look?
- Like a satsuma.

255
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:58,725
- It's monochrome.
- I'll take your word for it.

256
00:12:58,805 --> 00:12:59,805
Uh-huh.

257
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:02,405
- Do I look all right?
- You look like Otis.

258
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,325
- Is that a good or a bad thing?
- Well, neither, you just look like Otis.

259
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,165
You've never asked me
about your appearance before.

260
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:12,045
Is this the Maeve effect, perchance?

261
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,725
I hate this shirt and I hate crowds.
I hate parties.

262
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,885
- Eric, I don't wanna go.
- Uh, we have to go!

263
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,005
We've been waiting
our entire school lives for this.

264
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:22,445
Speak for yourself. I don't care.

265
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,045
Well, Maeve cares, so...

266
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,645
What are you doing?

267
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,165
- Eric, just be careful with...
- Hey!

268
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,245
Look. You need to loosen up.

269
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,605
I don't dance.

270
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:44,125
What's the point
of having all this music, then?

271
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:47,325
To listen to. I sit very still
and I appreciate the music.

272
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:49,565
Come on, you know you want to.

273
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,325
- There will be no dancing.
- Oh! Oh!

274
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:54,685
Dancey!

275
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,085
Dancey-dancey-dancing! That's right!

276
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:59,045
Stop! Okay, okay, I'll go.

277
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,845
- Look. Okay, come on, come on.
- Wait!

278
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,645
It will be your thing.

279
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:05,565
The Hat Man.

280
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,765
Mm-hm?

281
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:12,205
Hey! Come on, we're gonna slay! Come!
Come, come, come.

282
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,285
Darling, you're wearing a hat.

283
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,205
And I'm all orange!

284
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:19,005
Yes, I can see that.

285
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,645
You joining us on movie night, Eric?

286
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,245
Yeah, actually, we're going out.

287
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:26,685
- Oh. Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

288
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,645
A party! An actual party
that we have actually been invited to.

289
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:32,485
- Not technically invited.
- Whose party?

290
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,565
- No one's.
- Share. Aimee Gibbs!

291
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,725
She's, like,
one of the most popular girls in school.

292
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,245
Mm!

293
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,645
You're wearing aftershave, Otis.

294
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:48,325
Is there someone special
that you're going to meet tonight?

295
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,845
- Well, there's this girl...
- No, it's just a party.

296
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,765
Very normal. Boring, in fact.
Utterly platonic.

297
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:59,365
Right. Well, if you're going to do drugs
tonight, remember to buddy up.

298
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,325
- Mum!
- And look after one another.

299
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:04,085
- Let me get you some condoms.
- No! Thanks, Mum. Bye.

300
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,165
Comin'.

301
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:24,325
You know Jonathan is sensitive
to loud noise.

302
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,765
Sorry, Cynthia, I'll turn it down.

303
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:27,565
And also...

304
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,285
I wish I was a charity, love.

305
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:32,485
Look, I said I'll have the money
by Monday, all right?

306
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:34,965
You all right?

307
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:41,485
Let's hope you're not pregnant.

308
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,605
<i>♪ Rebel girl ♪</i>

309
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,045

310
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,645

312
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,485
I'll grab one of those too, please.

313
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,405
- Any preference?
- Whatever's cheapest.

314
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,885
How old are you, sweetheart?

315
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:18,045
Twelve. Wish I knew who the father was.

316
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:20,845
5.28, thanks.

317
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,205
Oh, my gosh.

318
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,285
Bet you they have loads of toilets.

319
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:34,285
- It's a bit quiet, isn't it?
- Doesn't start till 8:30.

320
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,885
Oh, it's only 8:15.

321
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,765
- On time is late.
- What does that even mean?

322
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:44,005
Late is late, early is early,
and we are very early.

323
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,885
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Ringing the buzzer.

324
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,341
No, you're not. We're gonna wait
until other people get here.

325
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,925
Eric, that's being very silly.

326
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:53,845
Otis, I just told you not to ring
that doorbell!

327
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,605
I don't know what's wrong...

328
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,685
Oh, no...

329
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,045
You... You look like you pooed yourself!

330
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,925
You will die!

331
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:11,885
Eric...

332
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,965
- Why would you ruin my trousers?
- Get off! Stop!

333
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:16,141
- You'll get me pooey!
- Otis, what is wrong with you?

334
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:20,165
You will die by fire and by force,
because I'm sick of it!

335
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:22,285
I'm sick of this behavior, man.

336
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,125
- Hey, Maeve.
- Hey.

337
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,205
You look fierce.

338
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,005
You look like a Wotsit.

339
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,165
Nice hat.

340
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,685
Hey, I think we're gonna have
to go home,

341
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,285
because he's ruined his trousers.

342
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,525
- Looks like he's done a poo.
- No, it's fine. We're going to the party.

343
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:41,605
Yeah.

344
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:43,405
Ah!

345
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,805
It's a bit... early, isn't it?

346
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,245
We're here for business.

347
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,125
Okay.

348
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,125
- Well, how come she can ring it?
- Well, she's not you, is she?

349
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,685

- Oh, I can't. I'm too nervous.

363
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:34,685
- Anwar's his unrequited crush.
- Aah.

364
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,805
Good excuse to break the ice. Go on.

365
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,725
I heard his ex broke up with him
because he wouldn't finger his bumhole.

00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,125
- Okay.
- So...

Really? I'm a cranberry juice sorta guy.

376
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,445
Cranberry juice is good for thrush.

377
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:22,125
You know, um, thrush?
It's a vaginal discharge.

426
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:00,885

- Not really.
- Me neither.

429

430
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,085

431
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:14,405
No, thank you.

432
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,805
Actually, uh... Okay, then. Yeah.

433
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,525
Apparently, I broke him.

434
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:26,845
You broke up with your boyfriend?

435
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,605
No, I broke him.

436

437
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:34,245
He's like, "Why don't you wanna have sex
with the lights on?"

438
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,325
I'm like, "Well, I don't want you
to see me naked."

439
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:40,605
And then he just goes on and on and on.

440
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,245
Dickhead.

441
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:43,645
Why don't you want the lights on?

442
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,085
'Cause I'm disgusting.

443
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,285
Kate, you in there?

444
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:52,005
I told you I broke him.

445
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:55,405
- Who's this guy?
- Oh, it's not like that, Sam.

446
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:58,085
He's non-threatening.
He's like a Care Bear.

447
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,485
I was just telling him
what a dickhead you are.

448
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:04,485
- Right. Well, I'm gonna go.
- Why are you talking to him?

449
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,005
- 'Cause you never listen to me.
- I do listen.

450
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:08,525
- I listen all the time.
- No!

451
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:10,645

to have sex in the dark.

467
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,845
What's the big deal?
Why can't you just accept that?

468
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:24,525
Enough. Enough!
This is ineffective communication!

469
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:28,005
Sam, if you want to tackle Kate’s issues
surrounding self-esteem,

470
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:30,965
whilst respecting your desire
for visual stimulation,

471
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,885
you need to establish
a clear verbal intercourse.

472
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,325
- You mean like talking dirty?
- No.

473
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:40,285
I mean stop passively hearing
and start actively listening.

474
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:41,885
Speak English, Care Bear Man.

475
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:43,325
Okay.

476
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:46,245
Kate, you want to have sex
with the lights off.

477
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:48,725
Sam, you want to see Kate naked.

478
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,445
But neither of you are listening.

479
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:51,965
Who are you again?

480
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,645
It doesn't matter who I am.
This isn't about me.

481
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:55,965
This is about you two.

482
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:00,565
I just... I don't understand women.

483
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,405
She... She likes me, she doesn't like me.

484
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,245
She wants my giant dick.

485
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:06,885
Sorry, my, uh... my large...

486
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:10,045
penis, and then
she doesn't wanna speak to me.

487
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,725
It’s all very confusing, Mrs. Jean.

488
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,325
Just Jean.

489
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:16,365
Well, you deserve closure.

490
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:20,045
I mean,
if the relationship is over, well...

491
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,045
...you could ask Aimee for some clarity.

492
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:27,645
Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:28,725
Mm.

494
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,045
Yeah.

495
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:31,685
Could you give me a leg up?

496
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:37,565
I think, if she doesn’t want you
at her party,

497
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,885
it's important
that you respect her wishes.

498
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,765
You're so wise.

499
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:46,765
Like an old owl.

500
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:50,725
Why are you here?

501
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,005
I was checking on Otis.

502
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:57,685
Wow.

503
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,725

504
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:16,645
Yes!

505
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,925

506
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,485

510
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:33,245
Hey, wait!

511
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,565
Not on the roses!

512
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:41,245
My parents are gonna kill me.

513
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:44,885
- They've barely got over the last party.
- Why did you have another one, then?

514
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,325
Ruby and Olivia said
they couldn't do it at their houses.

515
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:49,525

00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:05,645
Doesn’t he remind you of someone?

Adam?

523
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:11,005
No, I was thinking more
like a boiled Ryan Gosling.

524
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:13,325
- No, Adam.
- I deserve closure!

525
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,085

I don't know. He’s got nice eyelashes.

Oh, see? He thinks I'm gross!

567
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,525
- Stop saying that!
- Okay, let's just...

568
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:12,165
Let's calm down,
and, most importantly, listen.

569
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:14,405
- This isn't working.
- When we first started dating,

570
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,885
I used to get tongue-tied and flustered.

571
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:19,085
I still get like that sometimes.

572
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:21,045
I can't believe she wants to be with me.

573
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:22,925
I like everything about her.

574
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:24,765
Everything.

575
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,805
Do you hear what he's saying, Kate?

576
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:31,565
Yeah. Well, but I still don't believe it.

577
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:34,725
Okay. Kate,
what do you like about yourself?

578
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:38,405
- Nothing.
- Kate, I want you to name five things

579
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:40,765
that you like about yourself,
and it can be anything.

580
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,005
Come on.

581
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:45,525
I'm quite good at hockey.

582
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:49,605
I can make dumplings from scratch,
which is actually really hard.

583
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,685
I have a photographic memory.

584
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:57,245
Oh! I have this really spooky ability
at guessing which nationality someone is,

585
00:32:57,325 --> 00:33:00,685
- just by the way they walk.
- She does, it is awesome.

586
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:02,325
Go on. One more.

587
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:07,045
- I... think I have nice hair.
- It's so shiny.

588
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:13,205
If you don't like yourself,

589
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,085
how are you supposed to believe
that Sam does?

590
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:17,405

You wanted to keep this a secret,
now you wanna go on a date, do you?

615
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:14,645
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

616
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,405

617
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:42,485
Oof!

618
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:55,365
- All right, go on then, Eric.
- Okay.

619
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:59,405
Rule number one, enthusiasm is
more important than technique, yeah?

620
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:01,805
Don't go too deep. Looks awkward.

621
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:04,605
You can use a bit more pressure
than you think, actually,

622
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,405
but no teeth, especially
if you’re packin' metal, Natalie.

624
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:12,925

626
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:19,165
Aah... Mm... Aaah... Hm?

627
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:21,525
Mm? Mm-hm, mm-hm!

628
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:23,165
Not too deep!

629
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:24,325
Ruby, not too deep.

630
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:26,005

631
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,885
Mm!

00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,485

- Hey.

633
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:32,685
- You having a good night?
- Uh...

634
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,725
Not really. You?

635
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,205
Not the best, to be honest.

636
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:40,885
I hate parties.

637
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:43,845
Yeah, me too. Crawling with cretins.

638
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,405
I, uh... I gave out some free advice.

639
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:51,045
Really? To who?

640
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:52,845
Well, that's confidential.

641
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:55,725
But it's a client.

642
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:57,765
Not exactly a sex-pretzel bonanza, is it?

643
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:00,325
I’m sorry,
how many clients did you find tonight?

644
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:06,245
Um...

645
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:10,165
Sorry about, um... before, there.

646
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,325
I didn't realize you and Jackson were...

647
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,805
It's cool. He’s not my boyfriend
or anything. We’re just sleeping together.

648
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,845
- You know how it is.
- Sure, yeah. Yeah, ab... absolutely.

649
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:26,045
I think this is a bust.

650
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,845
I'm gonna get my shit, then I'm going.

651
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,485
See ya.

652
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:37,885

653
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,365

656
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:51,085

- Otis, darling!

657
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,365
You... I'm... You forgot your inhaler.

658
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:56,685
- I haven’t had an attack in six years.
- Well, what if you did?

659
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:59,085
I mean,
would any of these people help you? And...

660
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:01,205
That's an awful lot of responsibility to...

661
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,285
- You're spying on me.
- What?

662
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:06,685
- Don't be irrational.
- Irrational?

663
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:09,085
You're the one stalking your son.

664
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:11,485

young man.

665

Don't misuse it.

666
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,365

667
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,325
- how you might feel unjustly observed.
- Okay.

669

00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:24,765
Tromboner's teaching them
how to give BJs. It is priceless!

691
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,565

00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,605

00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:43,525
Adam, stop!

00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,045
- Suck, suck, suck a dick!
- Whoa!

699
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,005
- Suck, suck, suck a dick!
- Calm down!

700
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:51,365
Oh, my God! She's choking!

701
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,285
- Move aside.
- Okay! We need help!

702
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,565
Move! Move! Olivia!

703
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:56,565

00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:34,725

714
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:39,005
I need a wee and some crisps.

00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:43,045

- You always ruin everything.

Go home.

717
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:49,245
Hey, you know what's funny
about you and me, yeah,

718
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,845
is that we're different,
but we're both the same.

719
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:54,805
And we’re just two losers
that nobody wants.

720
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:56,605
And they don’t want us because...

721
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:03,765
Maeve.

722
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:06,685
So, uh... regroup on Monday?

723
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:09,925
Nah. This lot
aren't mature enough for therapy.

724
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:11,725
It was a stupid idea.

725
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:13,885
Sorry for wasting your time.

726
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:16,485
See you around, Otis.

727
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:23,085
It was lit. It was lit.

728
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,565
But, hey, did you guys manage
to find any clients?

729
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:31,045
Doesn't matter.
Maeve said the whole thing is off, so...

730
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,565
- What?
- Yeah.

731
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:34,445
I thought you guys were
really onto something.

732
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:35,965
I guess not.

733
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,445
Aww. Listen, who needs her, anyway?

734
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:44,525
There’s plenty more hot,
scary fish in-a the sea. Okay?

00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:48,445
Dude, where’s my hat?

736
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,725
Um... I might have lost it.

737
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:54,005
You're bad at bein' Hat Man.

738
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,325

- No, you're... No, you're not sorry.

739
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,061

- It's not funny.

00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,005

741
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:02,805

755
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:13,925
What is the point, Mum?

756
00:42:15,685 --> 00:42:16,725
You don't listen.

768
00:43:23,885 --> 00:43:25,645
I've just spoken to Aimee Gibbs' mother.

769
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:28,965
She's been trying to get her mother
out of the carpet all weekend.

770
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:31,605
- It wasn't my fault.
- No, no, no, no, it never is, is it?

771
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:35,365
Why can't you be more like your sister?

804
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,365

Yes! Yes, but, um,
toilet cubicles aren't gonna work.

811
00:46:01,165 --> 00:46:03,485
I'm not a priest,

I thought you didn't wanna be seen.

813
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:06,405
Well, yeah, but it's not about me.

814
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,301
It's about them, and it needs
to feel like a conversation.

815
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:11,685

for everyone.
