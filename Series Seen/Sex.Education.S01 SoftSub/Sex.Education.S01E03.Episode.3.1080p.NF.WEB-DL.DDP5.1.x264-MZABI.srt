1
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:12,885
<i>As she entered
the interrogation chamber,</i>

2
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:15,205
<i>Glenoxi felt her captor eyeing her.</i>

3
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:21,565
<i>His long serpentine tongue oozed
out of his wet, gash-like mouth.</i>

4
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:26,645
<i>She eyed his pulsating purple penis,
inching towards it.</i>

5
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,125
<i>She felt her abdominal sex cavity quiver.</i>

6
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:33,645
<i>She could almost taste one
of his three mucal glands.</i>

7
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:37,085
<i>As she pulled his glistening phallus
inside her,</i>

8
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:38,445
<i>she felt...</i>

9
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:40,925
<i>She felt...</i>

10
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,301
<i>"What am I meant to be feeling here?"</i>

11
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:49,045
<i>"This is your fantasy.</i>

12
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,965
<i>What do we do next?"</i>

13
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:53,525
<i>"What am I feeling?</i>

14
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>And why have I got dick hands?"</i>

15
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,845
I don't know.

16
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:08,885
Do you use contraception?

17
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,205
Yeah. Condoms.

18
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,245
- I didn't notice it split or anything.
- Mm.

19
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,885
Condoms aren't always
a hundred percent effective.

20
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:18,325
It certainly appears that way.

21
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:22,245
Have you considered
any other forms of contraception?

22
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,885
Uh, implants, the pill...

23
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:26,605
I'll think about it.

24
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,685
And how many sexual partners
do you currently have?

25
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:31,605
Male or female?

26
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:33,925
Just one at the moment. He's a he.

27
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,965
And have you considered
the possibility of adoption?

28
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:40,285
I don't think anyone would want
a pregnant 17-year-old.

29
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:41,605
Heh.

30
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,325
I don't want to do adoption, no.

31
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:45,645
Right.

32
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:49,485
And who's gonna be there to collect you
after the procedure?

33
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:50,605
Uh, no one, just me.

34
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,325
Mm. Uh, unfortunately, it's a requirement.

35
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:56,165
What if I was a serial killer?

36
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,325
Or a hermit?
Or my whole family had died in a fire?

37
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:03,125
- Would I still need to bring someone then?
- Yeah. It's our policy.

38
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,405
You think I have a sister?

39
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:10,885
I don't know, you could have.

40
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:14,645
We've lived together
17 fuckin' years, Jeffrey.

41
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:17,325
Wouldn't you know if I had a sister?

42
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:19,925
When's my birthday?

43
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,045
Fuck you, Jeffrey!

44
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,885
That's domestic abuse.

45
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:29,445
Forgettin' someone's birthday is not
domestic abuse, Cynthia.

46
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,365
Everything all right, love?

47
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,445
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,205
Bye.

85
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,685
Good morning, everyone.

86
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:44,525
As you all know,
we are holding a charity event next week

87
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,205
for Ugandan schoolgirls,
raising awareness for...

88
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,485
sanitary towels.

89
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,645
No. Um... Period pads.

90
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,365
Hm. Lady things.

91
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,325
Sanitary products...

92
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,205
And what are you doing here
so early, Maeve?

93
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,045
Gettin' a head start, Mr. Groff.

94
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,205
Very good.

95
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:13,005
- Carry on.
- Go with sanitary products, sir.

96
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,205
It's more professional.

97
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,365
Less creepy.

98
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,085
Right.

99
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:21,885
Good.

100
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,645
Thank you, Maeve.

101
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:25,405
You're welcome.

102
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:31,805
Uh...

103
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,125
You're late.

104
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:40,125
- Drop something?
- No.

105
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:42,125
No? Why are you eyeballing
the ground, then?

106
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:44,525
- I'm not.
- You are.

107
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,365
It's unsettling.

108
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,365
Whatever.

109
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:52,045
- You've got a 7:45, an 8:00, and an 8:15.
- Okay.

110
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,445
- Better be quick.
- Okay.

111
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,565
Do you want some background
of the clients, or...

112
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:56,925
No, I'm okay.

113
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,485
Okay.

114
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,965
I'm totally in love with Mr. Hendricks,
but he doesn't know I exist.

115
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:09,685
How do I make him see me?

116
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,965
Are you sure? I mean...

117
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,885
My pubes are out of control.

118
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,045
I've only just cut them
and they've grown back.

119
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:19,845
I'm like Wolverine.

120
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:21,845
And then how did that make you feel?

121
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:25,525
I fucked a warm melon,
and now it stings when I pee.

122
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:29,165
Now, that is unusual. Hm.

123
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,605
Hi. Uh...

124
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,525
- Do you have an appointment?
- Uh, no. Uh...

125
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:52,845
But can I just stay in here for a bit?
Um...

126
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,325
I... I want people to think I've had sex.

127
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:00,565
Listen, I hear you.

128
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:04,085
Peer pressure is hard,
but living with regret is harder.

129
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,885
No. Uh, sorry... Uh...

130
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:07,645
I don't need therapy. I...

131
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,885
I just wanted Molly Bell to see me coming
in here so she thinks I've had sex.

132
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,525
Uh, you don't have to speak.

133
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:14,685
Oh. Right.

134
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:16,285
Okay.

135
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:42,965
Morning, Eric.

136
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,685
Morning, Jean. Love the kimono.

137
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,165
Ooh, love the jumper. Look at that.

138
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:47,245
Rrrrowl!

139
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,605
Hm.

140
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,125
- What do you want?
- Is Otis ready?

141
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:54,445
No, he's gone already.

142
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,525
He had a project or something.

143
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:57,885
Didn't he tell you?

144
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,445
Oh, no, uh... He mu...
He must have forgotten.

145
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,645
What a silly little man.

146
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,405
- Hm.
- Mm. Okay.

147
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:06,685
It can be hard...

148
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,685
when friends find new interests.

149
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,925
But you mustn't feel left behind.

150
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:17,325
It can actually be an opportunity for you
to find out what's important to you...

151
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,085
as an individual.

152
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,165
Yeah.

153
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,565
- Mm.
- Do you have any hobbies?

154
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:24,885
Uh, not really.

155
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,085
I used to sing in church choir,
but then I realized I can't sing.

156
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,325
- Right.
- And I stopped believing in God.

157
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,125
- That'll do it.
- So... yeah.

158
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,365
So...

159
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,205
Cool. Cool.

160
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,725
- Bye, Jean.
- Bye, Eric.

161
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:38,965
Yeah.

162
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,445
- Jean Milburn?
- Yeah, that's me.

163
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,725
Bastard.

164
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,485
E! My man. How's it hangin'?

165
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,885
- Yeah...
- What, this?

166
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,125
Ed Sheeran. I mean, say what you want
about the little fella, but...

167
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,605
- he's a total genius, right?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,685
I've been meaning to speak to you.
Swing Band are holding auditions today.

169
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:22,301
- I think you should sign up.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

170
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,325
Why would you say that?

171
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,845
Look, me and, uh...

172
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:29,205
- Swing Band are sh...
- Hip. Yes, we are.

173
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,405
But one can only try.

174
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,885
Trying's the whole game.
No one can stop you trying.

175
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:36,045
Well, they can try, I suppose.

176
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,165
No, no, no, but seriously,
I think you should swing by.

177
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,245
Excuse the pun.

178
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:42,405
You could be a really great fit.

179
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:44,205
- Think about it.
- Yeah...

180
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,365
- Okay.
- Yeah?

181
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,525
Told you we'd make some money.

182
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:51,765
- ...show you...
- Uh... Sure, okay.

183
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,461
- See you later.
- See you.

184
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,805
Hey, Aimee,
what are you doing later today?

185
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,245
Going to Kyle's for a smoke.
We're a thing now.

186
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,925
- Why?
- Basically, I need someone to help me...

187
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,245
When you're stoned,
do you ever get a really relaxed asshole?

188
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,645
'Cause the other day,
I was doing a bong with Kyle

189
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,805
and I literally thought
I was gonna shit myself.

190
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,765
Like, I could feel it inching out
my bumhole.

191
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,485
- Has that ever happened to you?
- Not really. No.

192
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,901
- Sorry, what were you saying?
- What do you want, cock biter?

193
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:19,285
Nothing. Gotta go. Cocks to bite.

194
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,965
Maeve. Oh!

195
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,245
- You look hot today.
- Huh.

196
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,925
- What are you doing later?
- Why?

197
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,045
The qualifiers are today at 5:00
and I was gonna ask

198
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,005
- if you felt like watching me swim?
- Oh.

199
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,565
Right, um... I can't.

200
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:33,325
- Why not? What, you busy?
- Yeah, maybe I am.

201
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,885
Maybe I live a whole rich life filled
with adventure and intrigue.

202
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,925
It is possible to experience things
you don't know about, Jackson.

203
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:42,445
Okay. Uh...
Well, I might see you later, then?

204
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,245
If you're not too busy
adventuring or intriguing.

205
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,645
Jackson.

206
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,085
Yeah?

207
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:53,485
Uh...

208
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:56,565
Uh, good luck later.

209
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:59,245
Maeve. Hold on a second.

210
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,245
I need to talk to you
about your <i>As You Like It </i>essay.

211
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:04,685
Uh... Interesting use of alliteration

212
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,125
and quite a complex understanding
of Shakespeare's ability

213
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,805
- to penetrate the male psyche.
- Thanks.

214
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,205
- But...
- But what?

215
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:12,845
It's similar to Simone's.

216
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:14,725
Very similar, Maeve.

217
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:18,045
Maybe we're just being churned out
like little robots.

218
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,485
- Hm. You're a funny girl. Quick.
- Mm-hm.

219
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:22,725
Why don't you put some of that
into your work?

220
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,086
I really don't think you need
to be copying Simone’s work.

221
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,845
Please do not get yourself
kicked out of school.

222
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:31,005
It would be a colossal waste
of everyone's time.

223
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,565
Aren't you supposed to say
something encouraging?

224
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:35,125
Shine brighter.

225
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:40,365
So please remember to bring in
your baked goods

226
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,605
for the girls in year nine
who are raising money for Ugandan...

227
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:49,685
sanitary products.

228
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,045
As we all know...

229
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,965
well, some of us,
uh, more than others...

230
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,685
Uh, that special...

231
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,405
time of the month for women
is very normal.

232
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:05,341
- Where were you this morning?
- ...alter their everyday lives

233
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:08,605
- beyond mild inconvenience.
- Something really bad happened.

234
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:10,605
You forgot to save Zelda again?

235
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,981
So, imagine, if you will...

236
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,685
- I had a... sex dream...
- ...that you do not have any sanitary...

237
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,165
- ...about Maeve.
- That's brilliant!

238
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,925
About the sanitary things, yaaas!

239
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:24,925
Uh, anyway, um... uh...

240
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,365
that most uncomfortable thought...

241
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:30,421
- Oh, my God. Tell me everything.
- ...is why the fearless year nine girls...

242
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,525
Was it ALS challenge
or just your basic dick sneeze?

243
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,565
- It feels wrong, okay? I don't like it.
- No, it's fine.

244
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:38,245
It's not fine, okay?
My brain objectified her

245
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:41,645
- and I feel like a... like a bad person.
- But it's normal!

246
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:48,445
Menstruation is a very good thing.

247
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:52,045
Actually, it's... it's good
to have a good clean out.

248
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,405
Um...

249
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,045
Um, it's very healthy, actually, okay?

250
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,725
- Because if...
- Sit down. Sit down.

251
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,645
<i>♪ Fire ♪</i>

252
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,365

00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,485

258
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:26,325
- All right, dickhead?
- Hi.

259
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:27,885
Maeve, nice to see you again.

260
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,885
'Cause I saw you this morning.

261
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,605
In school, not in my dreams.

262
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:33,965
I need to ask a favor.

263
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,045
Oh, yeah? Uh, what is it?

264
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,245
I need you to meet me somewhere
after school at 6:30.

265
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,725
- Is this a clinic thing?
- No.

266
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:43,645
If you can't, don't worry.But...

267
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,245
Oh, yeah, Yeah, yeah. No, I can.

268
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,485
- Yeah?
- Completely.

269
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:49,205
- Um, whereabouts, exactly?
- Cool. I'll text you the address.

270
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:50,381
- Cool beans.
- See you later.

271
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:53,045
<i>♪ Bless my soul, I can't resist ♪</i>

272
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,365
Cool beans.

273
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,005
She's asking you on a date.

274
00:15:58,085 --> 00:15:59,605
- It's not a date.
- It's a date!

275
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:00,821
- She called me dickhead.
- Oh.

276
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,981
You don't call someone dickhead
and ask them on a date.

277
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,125
She probably knows
I had a creepy sex dream about her.

278
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,445
Now she's gonna expose me
as the lech that I am.

279
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,245
Uh, okay, she's not a psychic.

280
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:12,645
Also, chill out. You jizzed your pants,
you're not Hannibal Lecter.

281
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,525
- What if I am?
- Okay, what happened in this dream?

282
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:18,325
She was...

283
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,325
- Her pants...
- Uh-huh?

284
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:23,005
And... No, actually,
I don't wanna talk about this.

285
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,245
I... Oh, okay.
Well, what's at 439 Trently, anyway?

286
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:30,205
It's a tower block with a load
of businesses and-and a sushi restaurant.

287
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,525
- Why would she want me to have sushi?
- Raw fish is an aphrodisiac.

288
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:37,525
- This is totally a date!
- Oh, this is making me feel weird.

289
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:40,325
- I don't like being out of control.
- You'll be fine.

290
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,485
Okay? Whatever it is, just be casual.

291
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,565
Girls like dudes that are casual.

292
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,525
You know, chilled.

293
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,845
But maybe reconsider your outfit
just in case it is a date.

294
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,181
- It's not a date.
- It's a date.

295
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,405
It's definitely...

296
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,765
- What do you think I should wear?
- Ooh! Um...

297
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:59,645
Okay, uh, think Jon Hamm.

298
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:00,725
But chilled.

299
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,765
Okay? Like casual Hamm.

300
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,165
I'm not casual, though!
And I look nothing like Jon Hamm.

301
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:07,405
- Yeah, that's true.
- My God.

302
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:08,845
I need some new clothes.

303
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,005
Bye, Casual Hamm.

304
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:13,845
Oh, this?

305
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:16,285
Yeah, no, I'm auditionin' for Swing Band,
thanks for askin'.

306
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,005
So nice that you care about
what's happenin' in my life.

307
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:24,925
Okay, good night.

308
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,605
Good night.

309
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,485
Good try, Eric!

310
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,965
Huh? Right, team?

311
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:47,925
You know,

312
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,485
Swing Band's a collective.

313
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,725
I'm merely the guy with the baton.

314
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,365
So I'll leave it to the gang to decide
whether or not you're in,

315
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:58,365
but, remember that Leon has leukemia

316
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,605
and we do desperately need a French horn.

317
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:02,845
So...

318
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:04,325
What do we say?

319
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,725
Is Eric in da posse?

320
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,005
Huh?

321
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,045
Show of hands, please.

322
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:16,805
Can we get a show of hands, please?

323
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,325
And there it is.

324
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,725
You're in, Eric.

325
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:24,125
Congrats, man!

326
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,285
Pull up a pew, Mr. Magoo.

327
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:28,365
Sit down, girl.

328
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:30,005
Get outta here! Go on, sit down.

329
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,205
Okay, so...

330
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,685
- Let's watch...
- I can practice with you if you like.

331
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,325
Get you up to speed.

332
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:39,885
Okay, okay, okay.

333
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,365
Great, how about after school?

334
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,245
- Okay, and I want more sax on bar 12.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,045
- Here we go! Good.
- Yeah. Coolio.

336
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,685
Okay, guys, from the top.

337
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:49,165
One, two, three, four. One!

338
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,125
God!

339
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:55,845
Oh!

340
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,245
Feel it!

341
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:15,445
That was tight as fuck.

342
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,125
God!

343
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,525
Eat it!

344
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,645
At eight weeks,
your baby's heart is beating.

345

Did you know that at six weeks,
your baby can feel?

347
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:29,005
Shut up.

348
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:32,285
Life begins at conception.
Termination is murder.

349
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,525
- God loves you.
- Yeah, well, I wish he'd worn a condom.

Yes.

Yes, in fact, I'm starting a new book.

No! We're just getting some sushi.
I think.

441
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:35,125
Is sushi some kind of sick code
for killing your baby?

442
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,205
I don't think so.

443
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:38,765
We have some pamphlets
we think you'd be very interested in.

444

00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:51,725
- Who are those girls?
- My sisters.

515
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:54,605
It's a girl.

516
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:56,365
Ooh!

517
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:57,525
Eric's got a girlfriend!

518
00:27:58,765 --> 00:27:59,805
A girlfriend.

519
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:07,005
Hey.

520
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:09,245
It'll be all right.

521
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:13,005
I promise.

522
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,365
Just take my bloody hand.

523
00:28:40,445 --> 00:28:42,925
<i>- ♪ Sing me to sleep... ♪</i>
- Maeve?

524
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,565
Hi, Maeve. I'm Dr. Atwan.

525
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:45,885
Hop up on the table.

526
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:49,285
<i>♪ I'm tired and I ♪</i>

527
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:52,325
<i>♪ I want to go to bed ♪</i>

528
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:55,405
<i>♪ Sing me to sleep ♪</i>

529
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,885
<i>♪ Sing me to sleep... ♪</i>

530
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,365
- Maeve, are you right-or left-handed?
- Right-handed.

531
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:10,005
<i>♪ Don't try to wake me in the morning</i> ♪

532
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:13,125

<i>- ♪ I will feel so glad to go ♪</i>

535
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,245
This will make you a little bit sleepy.

536
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,565
So, do you have any hobbies, Maeve?

537
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:44,365
Oh, the usual. Water polo.

538
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:45,925
Crochet.

539
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:48,205
I also run illegal cock fights.

540
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,725
Is this supposed to be knocking me out?

541
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,485
'Cause I don't think...

542
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:08,725
You can't still be angry with me.

543
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:11,005
You should be ashamed!

544
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,685
I'm not with them.

545
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,245
I'm just waiting for a friend.

546
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,365
That bench had sick on it.

547
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:19,765
You spelt "foetus" wrong again, Charlie.
It’s not that hard.

548
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,165
Maybe I should just leave.
You obviously don't want me here.

549
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:25,285
Oh, right, so the babies
aren't that important then?

550
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,525
Okay. I think I am gonna go to the shops.

551
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:30,205
- Stretch my legs.
- I'll come with you.

552
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:35,205
Okay, well, how about we all go
to the shops together?

553
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:37,645
- I'm not going with him.
- Whatever.

554
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,805
Okay, I think we're about ready to start.

555
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,485
Would you like to have sex with me?

556
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:55,685
What... What are you doing?
Why are you naked?

557
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:57,645
- It's okay. I want to.
- Oh!

558
00:30:58,245 --> 00:30:59,405
I'd like to have sex.

559
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:03,845
I think you're sexy, and I really want
to have sex with someone.

560
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,805
- I'm gay!
- Fuck! Really?

561
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:07,045
Yeah, properly.

562
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:12,405
- You could pretend I'm a boy.
- Um, I don't think...

563
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:16,365
- We could wank each other off.
- No. No. No, thank you.

564
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:30,765
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No.

565
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,525
- No, it's Jesus.
- Really?

566
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,925
- Uh...
- I didn't realize Jesus could be black.

567
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,645
Well, he was probably brown,
but, you know, why not black?

568
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:44,205
God, black Jesus
is much sexier than white Jesus.

569
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:47,325
How come your Jesus has muscles?

570
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,085
Well, he probably had to do
a lot of carryin' and stuff.

571
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:51,845
- What's in here?
- Uh, no...

572
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:56,405
- Do you dress up like a lady?
- No.

573
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,886
No, I mean, I like dressin' up,
but no, I’m not a ladyboy or anythin'.

574
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,645
Let’s do a makeover.

575
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,005
Really?

576
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:06,805
Okay!

577
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:22,365
Come on, Jackson!

578
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,085
Come on!

579
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:28,485
Jackson!

580
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,045
Jackson!

581
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,205
On your marks, please.

582
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:57,205
- He had sex with someone else.
- Okay.

583
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:59,805
It's just so hard to get that image
out of my brain, you know?

584
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:00,765
Yeah.

585
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,365
I look at him and all I see
is other women with their lady bits,

586
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:05,165
and he’s putting his bits in their bits.

587
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:06,725
Penetrative sex. It's horrible.

588
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,805
- Have you ever had someone cheat on you?
- Um...

589
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:11,485
No.

590
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:14,085
When did this happen?

591
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:16,005
It was before we got together.

592
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,045
I thought you just said he cheated.

593
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:21,485
He did cheat, on Jesus.

594
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:24,125
We're supposed to wait till marriage.

595
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:26,005
But Charlie's born again.

596
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,165
Before he joined our church, he had a...

597
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:32,725
very different lifestyle,
or so I recently discovered.

598
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:36,765
Well, yeah, I can imagine it's hard

599
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:39,605
when you're comparing
your lack of experience

600
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,685
to someone else's sexual history.

601
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:44,285
What? No, I have experience.

602
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,365
- You do?
- Yeah.

603
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:50,885
Hand jobs, fingering,
oral, 69ing, a bit of anal stuff.

604
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,605
- That's extensive.
- Yeah, but no sex.

605
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:56,645
That's sacred, between a man and woman
on their wedding night.

606
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:58,045
Or it's supposed to be, but...

607
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:00,245
I'll just be another girl to him.

608
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,885
Jackson! Keep it going, son!
Keep your stroke!

609
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:08,325
You're nearly there! Come on!

610
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:12,885
Come on, that's right! Go on!

611
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:14,165
Go! Keep it going!

612
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:21,525
Yes!

613
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:22,565
Yes!

614
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,045
Well done!

615
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,525
Well done, my son!

616
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:32,005
Yes, Jackson!

617
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:35,125
Yes!

618
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:38,365
- Well done, my boy.
- Thank you, sir.

619
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,885
- Oh, well done, lad! Well done!
- Thank you.

620
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,461
- The school is very proud of you.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

621
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:45,645
Oh!

622
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:48,005
Thank you, sir. Hey, Mum.

623
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,205
Well done!

624
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,685
Listen, you're gonna have
to push yourself much harder

625
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:53,821
if you're gonna qualify for the counties.

626
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:56,005
- Look, that was my best time yet.
- No, I know.

627
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,205
But we can do better. Yeah?

628
00:34:58,285 --> 00:34:59,645
- Great.
- Yeah.

629
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,285
- Nice one.
- Well done.

630
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:06,005
- Well done.
- Cheers.

631
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:15,885
All right...

632
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:23,221
I know this is none of my business, but...

633
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:25,965
...you've kind of involved me here,
so I'm just gonna have to say it.

634
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:29,925
Charlie can't change his past.
And what's important is who he is now.

635
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,445
I mean, we all mess up
and do impure things.

636
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:35,205
Doesn't mean we're bad people.

637
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:38,605
All right?

638
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,845
Besides, didn't Jesus say something
about forgiveness?

639
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:46,005
Yeah, it's pretty much his whole thing.

640
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,445
What do you get someone
who's having an abortion?

641
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:54,645
Sunscreen.

642
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,245
They'll need it in Hell.

643
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,125
Thank you.

644
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:19,365
It's very annoying that you don't want
to have sex with me.

645
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,445
Sorry.

646
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,925
- I just wanna know how it feels.
- Yeah.

647
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,845
Have you done it?

648
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:29,445
Not all the way,
but I do watch quite a lot of porno.

649
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:31,565
- Show me.
- You don't wanna see gay porn.

650
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:32,925
I definitely do.

651
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:41,565
It's called rimmin'.

652
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:44,965
- Looks fun.
- Mm-hm.

653
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:46,981
- What do you think it feels like?
- What, rimming?

654
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,085
No, sex.

655
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:49,645
I don't know.

656
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:51,405
I think it'll be nice.

657
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:54,965
It feels good to wank,
so it must be like that, but better.

658
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,725
And doing it with someone who likes you
must be awesome,

659
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,005
because they really get you.

660
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:01,445
Maybe the two of you become one,
like the Spice Girls said.

661
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:03,645
Oh!

662
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:04,845
- I'm not sure.
- Hm?

663
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:07,485
- I just wanna feel a dick in my vagina.
- Mm-hm.

664
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:16,565
Lily, it's time for you to go home.

665
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:18,165
Um...

666
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,325
Thank you for having me.

667
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:25,405
See you at school, Eric.

668
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:38,005
It was me who asked to see the rimming.

669
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,125
Sorry.

670
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:46,485
Dad, it wasn't...

671
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:48,925
We were just havin' a bit of fun.

672
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:52,325
- You know, dressin' up for...
- It's time for you to grow up.

673
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:54,685
Get a job, take responsibility.

674
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,445
See what the real world is all about.

675
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:01,925
Take that stuff off your face
before your mother sees.

676
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:17,885
Hey.

677
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,525
I fixed the sign.

678
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:23,645
Your sign looks really good.

679
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:33,485
Um...

680
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:37,565
When we come out, you won't shout
at my friend, will you?

681
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:39,565
Um...

682
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:43,085
Probably will.

683
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:45,565
Yeah, I thought so.

684
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:09,765
Try and drink.

685
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:11,685
Mousse?

686
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:13,645
Um...

687
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:15,445
Thanks.

688
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,125
Hello, Sarah.

689
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:25,645
I remember you from last time.

690
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:27,645
Only vanilla left, I'm afraid.

691
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:30,845
- I don't like vanilla.
- Sorry, it's all we've got.

692
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:34,285
Can you see if... if there are
any chocolate ones left?

693
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:35,925
We're all out.

694
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:39,245
Ju... Yeah, but I know
that you've got them. So, can...

695
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:40,965
Can you just go and ask?

696
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,925
'Cause I... I really don't like vanilla,
it's not even a flavor.

697
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:46,525
Like I said, we haven't got any.

698
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:49,645
Yeah, and like I said,
I don't fucking like vanilla.

699
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:51,885
So I just want a chocolate one.

700
00:39:52,965 --> 00:39:54,485
We're not a restaurant, Sarah.

701
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:58,045
Maybe there'll be a chocolate one
next time you're here.

702
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,205
Oh.

703
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,245
Hey, Einstein.

704
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,565
Wasn't so bad, was it?

705
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,405
I don't like chocolate.

706
00:40:21,445 --> 00:40:23,005
Everyone likes chocolate.

707
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:24,925
Not me.

708
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,005
Thank you.

709
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,685
You're not as tough as you look.

710
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:37,885
It's been a shitty day.

711
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:39,565
Yeah.

712
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:45,085
Look, don't... don't worry, love.

713
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,245
I got three kids,

714
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:52,845
and I feel way more guilty
about the ones that I had

715
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:54,125
than the ones I chose not to.

716
00:40:57,365 --> 00:41:01,685
It's better not being a mum at all
than being a bad one.

717
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,845
I bet your kids really love you.

718
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:11,485
Hm!

719
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,645
Oh, fuck off and let me eat my mousse.

720
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,325
Okay.

721
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,085
Hey, Mum.

722
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:38,365
Let's get you home.

723
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:49,165
Hi.

724
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:52,605
You waited.

725
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,205
Of course.

726
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:00,325
You may have some vomiting or nausea.

727
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:02,605
If the vomiting continues
for more than 24 hours,

728
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:04,165
then you should inform the clinic.

729
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,485
Some bleeding is typical,

730
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,765
but if it’s very heavy,
then you should call us straightaway.

731
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:10,845
- Okay.
- Okay?

732
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,365
Not a word.

733
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,525
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

734
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:27,885
Do you want a sandwich?

735
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:32,205
You're so weird, Otis.

736
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:36,085
You should meet my mum
if you think I'm weird.

737
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:38,965
All she does is talk about sex.
She has zero boundaries.

738
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:42,245
She teaches this workshop called
"My Yoni, Myself."

739
00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:44,645
"Yoni" means vagina.

740
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:48,045
She hates my dad, too.
He lives in America.

741
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:51,925
But yeah, she's constantly asking me
inappropriate things,

742
00:42:52,005 --> 00:42:54,165
and she thinks it's totally acceptable.

743
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:55,885
She’s basically mental.

744
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:02,845
My mum's a drug addict.

745
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,005
She tries not to be, but... she is.

746
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,125
I haven't seen her for a while.

747
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:16,525
And I have a brother as well.
He's the funniest guy I know, but...

748
00:43:18,085 --> 00:43:19,645
he's a bit all over the place.

749
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:20,725
Not the most reliable.

750
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:25,885
- I didn't...
- Don't say sorry.

751
00:43:26,885 --> 00:43:27,885
Okay.

752
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:36,645
- Are those flowers for me?
- Uh... Yeah.

753
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:41,245
- Seems a bit inappropriate now.
- No.

754
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:42,685
No, I like 'em.

755
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,325
Nothing says "Happy Abortion"
like a bouquet.

756
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:00,965
This is me.

757
00:44:03,005 --> 00:44:04,965
Do you want me to come in? I can just...

758
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,685
No, it's OK. You can go.

759
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,645
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, yeah.

760
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:16,485
Sorry, I... I'm walking you in.

761
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:18,725
- I said I'd walk you home, so...
- Otis, I'm fine!

762
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:21,005
No! You might bleed or hemorrhage.

763
00:44:21,085 --> 00:44:23,005
Or you could have a reaction...

764
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,925
Do you want me to come inside with you?

765
00:44:31,005 --> 00:44:33,245
- Just in case...
- I'm not inviting you in.

766
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:36,645
I'll text you if I die.

767
00:44:37,165 --> 00:44:38,485
I'll keep my phone close.

768
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:46,885
If you tell anyone about this,
I'll kill you.

769
00:44:49,045 --> 00:44:51,725
I have a hatchet and I know
a good place to hide a body, okay?

770
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,565
<i>I spoke to Coach.</i>

771
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:08,485
Mm?

772
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:10,805
We need to focus on the county trials.

773
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:13,725
You don't want to let
an opportunity like this pass you by.

774
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:15,205
- I know.
- Do you?

775
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:17,701
That's the voice you use
when you're not listening.

776
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:20,765
Mum. It's okay, all right? I know.

777
00:45:21,525 --> 00:45:23,445
You don't wanna live with regret,
trust me.

778
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:26,205
I'm gonna book you in with a dietitian
first thing tomorrow morning.

779
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,725
<i>Glenoxi seized her interrogator.</i>

780
00:45:52,325 --> 00:45:55,005
<i>"Enough talk. It's time to fuck."</i>

781
00:45:55,405 --> 00:45:58,525
<i>She grabbed his giant purple penis</i>

782
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:01,725
<i>and thrust it towards
her abdominal sex cavity.</i>

783
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,765
<i>But his phallus grew limp.</i>

784
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:08,125
<i>"I'm gay," said the interrogator.</i>

785
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:12,605
<i>Disappointed, Glenoxi left the room.</i>

786
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,765
<i>Her quest for a mate
would lead her across the galaxy,</i>

787
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:21,685
<i>until she found an alien dick
to deflower her once and for all.</i>

788
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:35,485
Okay, ladies, that was fantastic.

789
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:37,645
Restore the floor.

790
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:40,965
Right, okay, let's take a break.
When we come back, I'll be...

791
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:42,485
Oh, hi.

792
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:46,525
Just gettin' a glass of water.
Kegel exercises are really thirsty work.

793
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:49,765
Oh! Your mum told us
all about your big news.

794
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:51,205
Congratulations.

795
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:52,645
What news?

796
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:54,525
Your ejaculation.

797
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:56,605
Well done, you!

798
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:21,365
How was it?

799
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:23,725
Tell me everything.
Did you feed her sashimi?

800
00:47:23,805 --> 00:47:26,085
- Um... It... It was nothing.
- Uh...

801
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:28,045
She just wanted me
to pick something up for her.

802
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:30,005
- What?
- Oh, just a thing.

803
00:47:31,925 --> 00:47:33,245
Hey, I, um...

804
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:36,285
I auditioned for Swing Band today
and I got in.

805
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:37,365
- You got in?
- Mm-hm.

806
00:47:37,405 --> 00:47:38,285
Nice one.

807
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:40,605
- Yeah, it's pretty great.
- I told you!

808
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:41,605
It's pretty great.

809
00:47:41,685 --> 00:47:43,605
Then this girl offered me sex,
which was weird.

810
00:47:43,685 --> 00:47:45,261
She might be crazy.

811
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:46,885
I think you'd like her.

812
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:49,365
Who's that?

813
00:47:49,525 --> 00:47:50,525
Um...

814
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,285
No one.

815
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,565
- You ready?
- Yeah.

816
00:47:54,645 --> 00:47:56,045
All right. You're gonna get bombed.

817
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,685
Oh, please. You only won last time
because you blue-shelled me.

818
00:47:58,765 --> 00:47:59,765
- Yeah.
- So don't try it.

819
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,605
- It's true.
- Don't try... Exactly.
