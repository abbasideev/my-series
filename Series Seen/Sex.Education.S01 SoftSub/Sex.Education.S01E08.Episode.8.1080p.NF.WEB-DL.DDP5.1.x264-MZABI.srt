1
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:20,325
Glenoxi.

2
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:23,005
At last we meet.

3
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:28,205
Lord Zortac. I’ve been expecting you.

4
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:33,685
I've traveled
across four universes to fuck.

5
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:37,005
Let’s do this, you cosmic hunk.

6
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:38,085
Oh!

7
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:41,605
Get to the sex!

8
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,205
Oh, okay.

9
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,325
Ow! Ow! Aah!

10
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:53,405
What’s wrong?

11
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:54,725
Nothing, try again.

12
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,565
Retreat! Oh, retreat.

13
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:02,685
- Oh...
- Why won't it go in?

14
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,565
I don't know.

15
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:54,645
Haven't you got training?

16
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:56,925
Not going. Can't be bothered.

17
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,045
Hey.

18
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,085
You know what I said before...

19
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:10,045
Like, the whole, like, "I love you" thing.

20
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,085
I was seriously wasted.

21
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:17,085
So I don't expect you to, like...

22
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:21,005
say it back or anything, you know?

23
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,045
Okay.

24
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:48,485
Dad?

25
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:51,365
I'm home.

26
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,965
Go and get ready for school.

27
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:01,405
And please, be quiet.

28
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,965
Your mother’s been worried sick
and she's only just gone to sleep.

You’ve been very quiet lately, sweetheart.

54
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:46,765
Is there anything wrong?

55
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:55,685
I made some notes on your book.

56
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:57,885
The one about me.

57
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,525
You should consider using
a thesaurus in the future.

58
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,765
Your vocabulary is very limited.

59
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:07,525
Otis, let's talk about this
in a calm and rational way.

60
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,565
Not calm! Not rational!

61
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,005
We'll talk about it later, darling.

62
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:21,685
Come on!

63
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,125
Ow!

64
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:24,885
Stupid bike!

65
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,445
- Is this about your mum’s book?
- Oh, no, I mean,

66
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:31,965
it’s only a heavily researched,
meticulously detailed account

67
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,925
of raising a sexually repressed
16-year-old boy.

68
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,645
Me, by the way.

69
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,805
Chapter One. "Otis's surprise emission."

70
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,325
Sorry. Not funny. Very bad, Jean.

71
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,845
Look, well, at least you went to the dance
with an actual girl.

72
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:49,805
- That's progress, man.
- I called her a goat and she left.

73
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,085
Still, an improvement.

74
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,965
Anyway, I thought you called her
a house cat.

75
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:57,165
Yeah, I also called her a goat.

76
00:06:58,365 --> 00:06:59,645
Do you like Ola?

77
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:03,045
Yeah, I... I do. A lot.

78
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,165
Then why did you call her a goat?

79
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,205
Promise not to laugh.

80
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,925
She seemed to think that
there was something going on

81
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,765
between Maeve and I, romantically, and...

82
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,245
Sorry, not the funny part.

83
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,925
I was trying to reassure her
how ridiculous that was,

84
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,285
because someone like Maeve
is never gonna be interested in me,

85
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,325
because I'm a loser
and she is a lioness.

86
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:27,245
Aaah.

87
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,485
Therefore, Ola is a house cat.

88
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,085
Wow.

89
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,965
Otis, you know, for a sex therapist,
you are surprisingly insensitive.

90
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,485
On the upside, at least you're gonna be
famous with this new book.

91
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,005
Like that man
that was born with tree arms.

92
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:48,085
<i>Maeve Wiley
and Otis Milburn to Mr Groff's office.</i>

93
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,165
The lioness awaits.

94
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:53,245
She’s still not talking to me.

95
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:56,165
Wow. Women really hate you.

96
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,045
Nice outfit.

97
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:05,685
- Thanks, Anwar. I love...
- There's really no need to respond.

98
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,285
Glad to see you back, Eric.

99
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,205
Uh... Thanks, sir.

100
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:22,805
Um...

101
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,365
- I've been meaning to apologize.
- Hey, it's...

102
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,845
Look, we all have bad days, you know?

103
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,885
But in every cloud, there is a rainstorm.

104
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,525
No, wait, sorry, that's not right.

105
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:35,005
"There is a rainbow in every cloud,"
is it?

106
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,885
- Okay...
- Basically, it's all in the past.

107
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:42,845
- Yeah.
- And, um...

108
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:46,205
- The two weeks of detention?
- Still very much in your future.

109
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:47,805
- Oh. Okay. Okay.
- Mm. So...

110
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:51,165
- I'll see you after school.
- Okay...

111
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,965
Look, about what... what happened...

112
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,045
I'm over it.

113
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:10,205
Maeve.

114
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:12,325
You're first.

115
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:24,125
<i>I've been watching you
and your little friend.</i>

116
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,685
Meeting up before school,

117
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,085
hanging around after hours,

118
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,165
secret whispers,

119
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,325
exchanging money.

120
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:37,125
Okay, well... we're just hangin' out.

121
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:42,525
I think you've been doing a lot more
than just enjoying each other's company.

122
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:52,245
I know all about your drug ring.

123
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:55,165
They're not mine.

124
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:03,405
You expect me to believe that
that spineless beanpole Milburn...

125
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:07,085
is responsible for dealing hard drugs?

126
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,365
Otis had nothing to do with it.

127
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:24,501
- These are study drugs, sir, they're not...
- You seem to know an awful lot about them,

128
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,765
considering you had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

129
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:30,125
Did you and your little friend
get them from your brother?

130
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,445
Oh, yes.

131
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:35,365
I know all about
your unsavory family history.

132
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,125
And you...

133
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:43,605
have let an innocent child
like Milburn be turned into a drug mule.

134
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:46,325
Otis didn't do anything.
Leave him out of it.

135
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,805
What are you doing?

136
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:53,125
I'm reporting your brother to the police.

137
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:56,445
Wait.

138
00:10:58,445 --> 00:10:59,445
They're mine.

139
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,045
What happens now?

140
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,245
You're going to tell me exactly
what happened at the school dance,

141
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,325
and then you will face
an external tribunal

142
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:20,285
who will decide whether
you have a future at this school.

143
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:28,885
- Milburn.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,325
A word to the wise.

145
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,005
Beware the wild female.

146
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:40,365
They will chew you up and spit you out
like stale crisps.

147
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:43,485
Get to class.

148
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,045
Yeah.

149
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:50,685
You’re not in any trouble. I sorted it.

150
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,365
Okay, what... what happened?

151
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,645
Are we... are we not gonna
talk about this? Is that it?

152
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,245
I trusted you, Otis.

153
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,845
But...

154
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,085
I don't want to have sex with you!

155
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,005
Neither do I.

156
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:14,005
You were bad.

157
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:16,765
You played whale music
and you would not stop talking.

158
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,245
Then you had a panic attack
and I had to get your mum.

159
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:21,685
It was an appallingly awkward
sexual experience.

160
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:24,765
Look, I need some advice...

161
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,205
About my...

162
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,845
Clinic's over. Sorry.

163
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,085
I didn't tell anyone
about what happened.

164
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:36,285
You kind of owe me.

165
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,085
It wasn't fucking funny when I pushed you
out of my vagina, either.

166
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,085
Hello?

167
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,605
<i>Jean Milburn?</i>

168
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:59,445
This is Simone McAllister
at Bright and Sanders.

169
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,845
You sent us
the first chapter of <i>Bringing Up Men.</i>

170
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:04,685
<i>We're in the midst
of a crisis of masculinity</i>

171
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,365
<i>and this feels potentially
quite zeitgeisty.</i>

172
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,845
<i>- Is there more to read?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,485
- Yes, there is.
<i>- Fantastic.</i>

174
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,365
<i>We're particularly interested</i>

175
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,285
<i>in the connection you have
with the subject.</i>

176
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:17,685
<i>It’s so personal.</i>

177
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:20,645
We really feel it could
strike a chord with other mothers.

178
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,085
When do you think you could send
more pages over by?

179
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,525
Can I get back to you on that?

180
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,125
Yep. Absolutely.

181
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,405
Don't take too long, though.

182
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:29,645
I won't.

183
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,605
Thank you.

184
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,445
Shit! Shit, shit.

185
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:41,205
Oh, God.

186
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,925
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, Jakob? It's Jean.</i>

187
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,965
I'm really sorry to bother you,

188
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:59,285
but I'm afraid my pipe's
burst under my sink.

189
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,765
<i>- And the water's going everywhere...</i>
- Jean.

190
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:04,085
You have to stop breaking things
when you want sex.

191
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,325
<i>No, no... No.</i>

192
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:08,805
That's... Er, it's a misunderstanding.
I, uh... No, it's really broken.

193
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,605
I think I have been very clear.

194
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,845
I want a relationship.

195
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,805
I do not want to be your handyman.

196
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:17,885
<i>Goodbye, Jean.</i>

197
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:31,725
- So, what seems to be...
- My vagina has betrayed me.

198
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,965
Okay. How, exactly?

199
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,525
I finally find someone who's DTF,

200
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:42,765
and he can't get his average-sized dick
in my stupid vagina.

201
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,445
Why is this happening to me?

202
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,525
Uh, well... um...

203
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,285
It just doesn't make any sense.

204
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,805
I've worked so hard.

205
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,885
The set, the costumes, the makeup.

206
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,445
Everything was perfect.

207
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,805
I couldn't even get my finger in there.

208
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:59,445
It's like my vag has lockjaw.

209
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,605
What do I do?

210
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,645
Well, you used the word "perfect."

211
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,965
Maybe it's a way of staying in control.

212
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,085
In... in your fantasy, you're in charge.

213
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,725
And reality can be...
just, quite different.

214
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,565
Nah, I just like aliens.

215
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,005
Do you like being out of control?

216
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:20,285
I guess not.

217
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:22,445
Like, I hate roller coasters.

218
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:26,005
Me, too. I do not like simulated danger.

219
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,525
I guess I am kind of type A.

220
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:33,445
Well, maybe...

221
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,965
you're unconsciously halting your progress

222
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:38,885
to stay in control.

223
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,005
But I want to have sex,
so why would I do that?

224
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:48,885
I don't know.

225
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,325
Okay.

226
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:56,565
I need this place spick and span.

227
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,045
I've got to do all of this on my own?

228
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,805
No! No. God, no.

229
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:03,485
That would be impossible.
Uh, no, you have company.

230
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:07,245
Okay.

231
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,805
I'll see you boys in two hours.

232
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,725
Okay?

233
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:21,685
Go ahead, Tromboner.

234
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,245
Get to work.

235
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:30,925
I don't need a plumber tomorrow,
I need a plumber today, you moron!

236
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,125
Otis, could you just...

237
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:37,445
Uh... You did not just hang up on me!
You did not just hang up on me!

238
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:39,685
Otis!

239
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,485
This emergency supersedes our argument!

240
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,965
<i>Otis, open the door, please!</i>

241
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,285
Leave me alone!

242
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,845
Jesus Christ, Mum! Get out, please!

243
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,285
While you are still under my roof,

244
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:09,126
- you are not to shut me out.
<i>- ♪ I would say I'm sorry if I thought ♪</i>

245
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,405
<i>♪ That it would change your mind ♪</i>

246
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,525
<i>♪ This time I have said too much... ♪</i>

247
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:17,605
- Oh!
- Why are you so angry?

248
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,365
- You're a hypocrite!
- What?

249
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,325
How? Wh...

250
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,045
- Descriptive words, please.
- Okay.

251
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:26,165
You say you're all about honesty
and clear communication,

252
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,445
but you're not honest at all.

253
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,885
You inveigle your way into everything
I do and then act like it's an accident.

254
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:35,005
You cross multitudes
of parental boundaries on a daily basis.

255
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:38,685
You're a... sneaky, sneaky woman!

256
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,645
That is a vast over-exaggeration.

257
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,645
Well, how is the book coming along?

258
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,045
This is becoming hostile now, Otis.

259
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,405
I want you to count to ten.

260
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,565
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

261
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:52,965
Please leave!

262
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,005
Ah, so, if...

263
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,205
<i>If </i>the book gets published,

264
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:06,725
of course I will change your name.

265
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:09,045
That's not the point, Mum.

266
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,405
I thought you were finally
listening to me,

267
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:16,165
that you were letting me be independent,
but you just can't help yourself.

268
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,045
It's like you want to consume me.

269
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,605
You're like the spider-mums
that eat their own offspring.

270
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,765
Like, you think I'm somehow part of you.

271
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,365
Well, you are part of me.

272
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,085
No, I'm not, Mum.

273
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:37,885
I'll get it.

274
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:46,445
Um... Ola!

275
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,645
You're at my door. Um...

276
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:51,325
Eh... Did you get my text?

277
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:54,045
It said, uh... "Hello."

278
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:56,205
But I guess it should have said, "Sorry."

279
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,885
My dad sent me to fix your sink.

280
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:02,925
Um, look, you don't... you don't need
to do that. My mum's called a plumber.

281
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,645
Uh... This is awkward. Um...

282
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,285
I mean, we kind of
went on a date, didn't we?

283
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:21,565
And now you're angry with me,
but you're also fixing my sink.

284
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,525
I'm fixing your mother's sink
as a favor for my father.

285
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:25,605
It's not about you.

286
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:31,605
Jakob sent her.

287
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:36,445
- Otis, we need to talk about our fight.
- I'm going out.

288
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,005
She's so selfish.

289
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:47,221
She pretends the crazy food regime
and early mornings is for my benefit,

290
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:48,165
but it's all about her.

291
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,325
I don't even know if I like
anything except swimming.

292
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:51,365
Shut up.

293
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,245
What?

294
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:55,645
You don't know how lucky you are.

295
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,725
She gets up every morning
to take you to swimming.

296
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:01,365
She goes to all your races.

297
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:02,661
- She cries when you lose.
- Wh...

298
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,405
She shows you every day
that she loves you.

299
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,165
- What's the problem?
- I'm not...

300
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,725
It might be annoying,
but at least she cares.

301
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,165
Okay.

302
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,125
Maybe just tell her the truth
about how you feel.

303
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:21,725
I didn't mean to snap, I'm sorry.

304
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:32,325
I need to go talk to my idiot brother.

305
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:58,965
Hey, sis, you wanna get baked?

306
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,045
No.

307
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:05,965
You said you were gettin' a proper job,
not sellin' shit again.

308
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,005
Yeah, I am.

309
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,165
My mate said he could
hook me up as a doorman.

310
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,365
You wouldn't last one day,
with your weak little arms.

311
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:22,141
My teacher wants me to apply
for the Aptitude Scheme at school.

312
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:27,845
Oh, what, you're serious?

313
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:32,045
What, so soon you'll be hangin' out
with a bunch of fuckin' virgins,

314
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,125
talking about astrophysics and shit?

315
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:35,285
If I get in.

316
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,685
I'll probably mess it up somehow,
I always do.

317
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:41,245
Nah.

318
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:44,165
You're way smarter than me.

319
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:46,805
You always have been,
ever since you were a kid.

320
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:49,365
You're smart.

321
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,205
Yeah, but...

322
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:54,605
You're, like, smart-smart, like...

323
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:57,165
You know,
could actually have a good life smart.

324
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:02,245
I just don't wanna be living here
in ten years, you know?

325
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:04,765
You won't be.

326
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,045
I'm gonna get that doorman job.

327
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:12,365
I'll save up and we'll rent a place
and we can really get our shit together.

328
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:15,445
Yeah, that sounds nice.

329
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,805
I'm really proud of you, sis.

330
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:20,845
Thanks.

331
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:18,725
You know, if you helped me,
we could get out of here a lot quicker.

332
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:27,925
Ouch! Stop it.

333
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:33,405
Asshole.

334
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,005
What did you say?

335
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,045
Were you born a bully? Or are you one
because your dad's one?

336
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:45,085
I saw you at the dance.

337
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:48,205
You were terrified of him.

338
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,285
Can't imagine being afraid
of my own dad.

339
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,285
What the fuck would you know, Tromboner?

340
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:04,885
You're doin' it wrong. Let me try.

341
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,445
- Give it here.
- No, it's fine.

342
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,525
Adam, it's fine, I can do it myself.

343
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:11,925
Just give it. It's fine.
- You can just leave it.

344
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:14,605
Leave it, man! What's wrong with you?

345
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,045
Get off!

346
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,045
Get off me!

347
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,405
Sorry.

348
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,845
Sorry, I didn't mean...

349
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,845
How do you like it?

350
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:47,965
I don't.

351
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,405
Yeah.

352
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:52,685
Didn't think so.

353
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,445
<i>♪ He hit me ♪</i>

354
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:12,565
<i>♪ And it felt like a kiss ♪</i>

355
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:17,285
<i>♪ He hit me ♪</i>

356
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:25,165
<i>♪ And I went down ♪</i>

357
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:42,285
<i>♪ Oh, whoa, oh, whoa ♪</i>

358
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:52,965
So, what does this sheer and
perilous hill have to do with my vagina?

359
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,205
I think you have
something called "vaginismus,"

360
00:25:56,565 --> 00:26:00,925
which is the body's automatic reaction
to a fear of vaginal penetration.

361
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,205
But I really want to have sex.

362
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:05,645
I don't think you're afraid of having sex.

363
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,245
I think you're afraid to let go.

364
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:13,405
Which is why
you are going to ride down this hill.

365
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:14,725
To face your fears.

366
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,405
I don't wanna fuck a hill.

367
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,525
Just trust me on this one.

368
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:21,045
Well, what about you?

369
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,245
What about me?

370
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,845
You had a panic attack
when I touched your penis.

371
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:28,965
Maybe we should do it together?

372
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,845
I... I...

373
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:33,685
You know what? Eh... forget it.
This is... silly.

374
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:34,645
So unsafe.

375
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:37,325
You know, your vagina's gonna open
at some point.

376
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,565
I can't wait for that!

377
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,685
Fuck it!

378
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:45,765
Whoo!

379
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,285
This is amazing!

380
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:53,845
This is amazing! Whoo!

381
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:58,765
Aah! I think that was my hymen!

382
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:00,525
Aah! Fuck!

383
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,285
Aaah! Aaah!

384
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:03,885
Otis?

385
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:08,045
Ow!

386
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,165
Otis?

387
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:11,165
Fuck!

388
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:12,725
Otis?

389
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,725
Am I dead?

390
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,165
No, you're alive.

391
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:17,845
Thank God.

392
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,365
Ow! It hurts.

393
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,845
Ah, your head is bleeding.

394
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,685
So, this mean I can have sex now?

395
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:30,085
I hope so.

396
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:32,605
Why do you wanna have sex so bad?

397
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,325
What do you mean?

398
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:40,845
You just seem...

399
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:42,405
Ow.

400
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:46,485
You seem desperate to have sex,
I don't know why.

401
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:49,405
I dunno.

402
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:53,285
I guess I just feel like,
if I don't do it,

403
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:56,005
then I'll graduate school
and I won't have had sex,

404
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:59,285
and then I'll go to uni
and I'll be behind everyone,

405
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,685
and no one will have sex with me
because I'm just the weird virgin girl.

406
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,245
And then I'll never have sex

407
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,485
because I'll be too embarrassed
and weird and virginal,

408
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:08,925
and then I'll grow old
and die alone in my house,

409
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,205
where I'll be eaten by my pet python.

410
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:14,565
Okay, you've skipped
a whole load of steps there.

411
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,245
I just don't want to be left behind.

412
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:22,005
I just want it over with.

413
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:26,965
Look, I know it feels like
everyone's doing it, and...

414
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:31,445
yeah, some people are,
but most of us aren't yet.

415
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:33,325
It's not a race.

416
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,525
I think that makes sense.

417
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:38,925
Good.

418
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,405
We just rode down this hill
for no reason, didn't we?

419
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:46,485
Yeah.

420
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,125
Oh!

421
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,525
That...

422
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,845
What was that?

423
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,965
Adam, we should talk about...

424
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,805
If you ever tell anyone about this,

425
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,885
I will fuckin' end you, do you understand?

426
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:32,685
<i>♪ Just take those old records

How was detention?

436
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,605
Why? It very was boring.

437
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:11,485
Nothing weird happened.
It was a very average detention.

438
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:26,645
<i>Maeve Wiley,
report to Mr. Groff’s office immediately.</i>

439
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:31,485
Please tell us
why you should stay at this school.

440
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,365
Nothing?

441
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,365
Very well, then...

442
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:46,605
I'm really smart, sir.

443
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,645
I'd read all of Jane Austen
by the time I was 12.

444
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,485
Including her lesser-known work,
<i>Lady Susan,</i>

445
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,925
which is a severely underrated piece
of feminist literature.

446
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:02,285
Um... I can also debate
the inherent difference

447
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:04,845
between existentialism
and transcendentalism,

448
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:07,645
explaining why Sartre
is the prominent voice of the former,

449
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:10,325
and the latter is barely remembered
as a philosophical movement.

450
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:14,165
I can also gauge the depths
of Mr. Hendricks' personal despair

451
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:15,765
based on his choice of Hawaiian shirt.

452
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:22,485
I'm really smart.

453
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,885
I just got unlucky
in the family department.

454
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:29,925
I don't get any support.

455
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,445
And sometimes I do the wrong thing.

456
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:36,285
But I know I can be better.

457
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,965
And if you give me a second chance,
I will not waste it.

458
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:44,325
Thank you, Maeve.

459
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,605
Come.

460
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:53,805
Er, you wanted to see me, sir?

461
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:57,365
Yes. If you could just wait outside,
please, Jackson. I won't be long.

462
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,045
Okay.

463
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:09,805
We'll need some time
to consider your position.

464
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:11,725
Until we do so,

465
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,085
you are barred from campus.

466
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:21,725
The valves are shaped to stop them
opening in the wrong direction.

467
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:27,005
The day you arrive on time, Adam,
is the day I eat my hat.

468
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:30,125
Take a seat. There's one next
to your detention pal, Eric.

469
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:32,685
- He's not my detention pal.
- We're not friends.

470
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,525
- Right, okay. Well, just sit down.
- Okay.

471
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,285
Come on, <i>hombre. Andale.</i>

472
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,605
<i>¡Andale! </i>Where was I?
Oh, yes. Valves, yeah.

473
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:41,045
So...

474
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,645
Yeah, the sound of the valves closing,
here and here,

475
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:47,885
is what we familiarize ourselves...

476
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,805
That's the sound
we familiarize ourselves with,

477
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,125
that is actually our heartbeat.

478
00:32:52,485 --> 00:32:54,125
Okay? Heartbeat.

479
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:55,725
Rhythm.

480
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:59,245
Now, these things here, the arteries...

481
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,685
The pulmonary arteries,

482
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:03,405
when these get blocked...

483
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:24,405
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

484
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,405
Didn't look like nothin'.

485
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,541
- Hey, why won't you talk to me?
- I said it's nothing.

486
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:29,605
Well, stop lyin'!

487
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:33,725
They're probably gonna expel me
because of some shit my brother did.

488
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,765
Is that what you wanna hear?

489
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:39,165
- Shit, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, yeah.

490
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:41,405
Hey, talk to me. What's up?

491
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:42,885
- Come here.
- Don't touch me!

492
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:46,205
- What?
- This is too much.

493
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,005
- What do you...
- You're too much.

494
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:53,045
Why am I always the last to know, Maeve?

495
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:56,685
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you don't trust me.

496
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,245
You never have.

497
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,325
Do you love me?

498
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:12,245
- Just say you don't and I'll...
- I don't.

499
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:23,285
Jackson, wait.

500
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,821
I think we both know that
you like somebody else anyway, Maeve.

501
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:29,125
Thank you
for coming to see me.

502
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:31,165
I fully appreciate, as head boy,

503
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:34,165
you have a very full schedule
with your fellow students,

504
00:34:34,245 --> 00:34:35,885
er, and also classes to attend,

505
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:38,525
but I did feel that it was important
to tell you

506
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:42,325
that you are one of Moordale's
proudest achievements.

507
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:45,885
It would be a tragedy
to watch you waste your gift

508
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,485
and miss this race.

509
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:51,805
We all go through rough times,
but your future is very bright.

510
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:55,565
This isn't about my future, sir,
this is about your sports fundin'.

511
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:57,845
No, it's... Uh...

512
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:01,645
Well, ye... yes, okay, sure,
but... A little bit, maybe, but it...

513
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,885
We do really care about you.

514
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:09,645
Okay. I'll swim.

515
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:11,285
- Oh, fantastic!
- If...

516
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:14,325
you let Maeve Wiley stay at school.

517
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,485
You can't expel her.

518
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:19,605
Want me to swim? Then she stays.

519
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:31,285
Heard you're getting expelled, Cock Biter.

520
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:34,245
Oh, well, back to the caravan park, then.

521
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:37,765
Maybe you don't have to leave.
I hear they're looking for a new cleaner.

522
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:43,565
What the hell are you doing?

523
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:46,645
I'm dumping you. For her.

524
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:49,405
Are you mental?

525
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,365
She's a slag.

526
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,245
Yeah, you're right.

527
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:55,565
But so am I.

528
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,605
- I'm not a slag.
- Me either, it sounded good.

529
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,045
Just keep walking.

530
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:13,485
- You wanna play some <i>Smash Bros?</i>
- Oh, I can't, I've got detention.

531
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,005
Man, things have really changed

532
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:17,725
- since you started punching people.
- Mm.

533
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:19,965
Dude, why is your mum here?

534
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:22,645
I don't know.

535
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:26,925
- I'll see you later, all right?
- See you later.

536
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:29,845
I'm not stalking you, I promise.

537
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:33,005
I was passing and I just wa... Otis?

538
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,045
Will you talk to me, please?

539
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,925
Can you not shout, okay?

540
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:43,485
I wish you weren't so concerned
about what your peers thought.

541
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:45,885
You don't want to develop
a subservient personality trait.

542
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:46,965
What do you want?

543
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:49,965
You're right.

544
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:53,165
I am a hypocrite.

545
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:56,525
And you are my blind spot.

546
00:36:58,005 --> 00:37:02,445
Since your dad left,
it's just been the two of us.

547
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,885
But you're growing up, and...

548
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:08,805
And I feel like I'm losing you.

549
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:12,285
So you decided to write a book
about my sexual dysfunction?

550
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:18,645
I thought that it might help me
to understand you better.

551
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:20,925
That's so messed up.

552
00:37:24,805 --> 00:37:26,525
And you're not repressed,

553
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:30,085
or dysfunctional, or unusually stunted,

554
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,005
or any of the things
that I said in the book.

555
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:34,365
And I'm sorry.

556
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:40,045
Yeah, well, I am all those things, Mum.

557
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:43,845
And... some of it is your fault.

558
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:48,205
A lot of it's Dad's fault,
but mostly it's just...

559
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:49,285
it's me.

560
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,445
I'm not... I'm not normal.

561
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:54,205
Of course you're normal.

562
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:58,285
You're 16.

563
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:02,285
You're not supposed to know
the answers to anything.

564
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,525
You're going to be just fine.

565
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:23,005
Thank you for saying sorry.

566
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:25,565
Well, apologizing
isn't just social etiquette,

567
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:27,645
it's a hugely important human ritual

568
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:31,965
that brings relationships together
and helps people to move forward, and...

569
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,805
And you already know all that, don't you?

570
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,685
Do you want to go home?

571
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,125
Um...

572
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:45,845
Actually, there's something I need to do.

573
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,685
- But I'll be back. I'll be back later.
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.

574
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,005
You!

575
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:05,485
It's your lucky day.

576
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,205
Adam couldn't make it,

577
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,165
and there's a speed dating event
for jazz lovers

578
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:11,685
that I simply am dying to attend,
so, uh...

579
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:14,245
You can go!

580
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,005
Get out of here!

581
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,165
Eh...

582
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,045
Okay. Thank you, sir.

583
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,245

Mum, don't make me go.

605
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:49,565
It's what your father wants.

606
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,965
<i>One of you will be going home.</i>

607
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:58,605
<i>You are not just serving your food...</i>

608
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:10,245
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

609
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:12,885
What? Oh.

610
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:18,205
It's not just pheromones.

611
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:20,645
I like you.

612
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,765
Christ, I feel like a teenager.

613
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:27,925
And it's been a long time since...

614
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:31,125
I've felt like this.

615
00:41:32,765 --> 00:41:33,765
But?

616
00:41:34,645 --> 00:41:35,645
But...

617
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:41,645
my son is the most important person
in my life.

618
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:44,325
And he really likes your daughter.

619
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:48,285
But my fear is he found out that...

620
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:51,805
we were in a relationship,
he just would...

621
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:54,005
never forgive me.

622
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:55,565
I understand.

623
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:00,405
It's for the best.

624
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,245
Yeah.

625
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:15,925
What are you doing here?

626
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:18,205
I'm buying all this cat food.

627
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,525
- I didn't know that you had a cat.
- I don't.

628
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,805
I'm buying all this cat food because...

629
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:25,045
I really like cats.

630
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:27,285
House cats in particular.

631
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:29,725
I like them way more than lions.

632
00:42:30,645 --> 00:42:32,045
Is this supposed to be romantic?

633
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,485
Yeah. It was.

634
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:38,885
You're holding up the line!

635
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:42,645
Sorry, I'm... I'll just be a minute.

636
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:44,285
We're resolving a past wrongdoing.

637
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,205
Yes, I can see that.

638
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:47,485
It's not cute.

639
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:49,125
It's annoying.

640
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:50,365
We'll just be a moment.

641
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:52,965
Don't you take that tone with me,
young lady.

642
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,365
Very rude.

643
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:57,805
She's not rude, okay?
She just has a very direct manner.

644
00:42:57,885 --> 00:43:00,925
She's rude and you're pathetic.

645
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:02,605
Now who's being rude?

646
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:05,085
- Ow!
- Stupid boy!

647
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,205
She hit me.

648
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:12,085
That was very brave.
And also quite emasculating.

649
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:16,485
Look, my shift is over in 15 minutes
and I'm gonna walk you home.

650
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:25,605
Whoo! Whoo!

651
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:27,005
- Go on!
- Whoo!

652
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:29,285
- Come on. Go. Focus! Focus!
- Come on!

653
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,525
Whoo!

654
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:54,045
Set...

655
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,685
<i>Mail call!</i>

656
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:07,085
A young lad dropped it off.
Skinny, sickly-looking fella.

657
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:12,485
Had some really interesting thoughts
about me and Jeffrey's marital problems.

658
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,125
Thanks.

659
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:17,925
- Have you seen my brother?
- Oh, yeah.

660
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:19,565
He told me to pass somethin' on to you.

661
00:44:19,605 --> 00:44:24,325
He said... "Tell Maeve to stop hangin'
around with a bunch of geeks

662
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:26,925
talking about astrophysics and shit."

663
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:29,005
Something like that.

664
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:31,445
Did he tell you where he was goin'? Or...

665
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:33,805
Said 'e was doin' some shoppin',

666
00:44:34,645 --> 00:44:36,005
but he had a big bag with him.

667
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:40,005
Okay. Thanks, Cynthia.

668
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:42,645
Jonathan.

669
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:49,925
Come on, Jackson!

670
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:00,165
Yes!

671
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:05,725
Come on, Jackson! Yes!

672
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:10,165
We knew you could do it!

673
00:45:10,565 --> 00:45:11,565
Well done.

674
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:14,645
Is she staying?

675
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:17,765
I don't take bribes.

676
00:45:18,565 --> 00:45:21,205
I suggest you forget about Maeve Wiley.
Hm?

677
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:26,565
There he is! Jackson! Well done, Jack!

678
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:29,125
- Well done!
- Darling!

679
00:45:29,725 --> 00:45:30,965
- Well done.
- Well done.

680
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:56,245
<i>Maeve, I'm so sorry that I hurt you
and betrayed your trust.</i>

681
00:45:57,365 --> 00:45:59,445
<i>You saw something in me
when no one else did.</i>

682
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:02,005
<i>I was just this invisible guy
in the corner,</i>

683
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:04,245
<i>and I thought I liked being that way.</i>

684
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:07,605
<i>Then I met you and I figured out
I'm actually good at something.</i>

685
00:46:08,485 --> 00:46:11,845
<i>I hope you can forgive me and that
we can keep doing the clinic together.</i>

686
00:46:12,725 --> 00:46:15,845
<i>You're the smartest person I've ever met
and this award is yours.</i>

687
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:23,965
Okay. Look, so...
Something I need to tell you.

688
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:26,205
There's a few things, actually.

689
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:27,405
So, uh...

690
00:47:27,485 --> 00:47:29,565
This is my house.
You know that.

691
00:47:29,965 --> 00:47:30,965
Um...

692
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:32,925
Eh... I'm an odd person.

693
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:36,765
What I mean is, I'm unusual,
and if you wanna be with me, then...

694
00:47:36,885 --> 00:47:38,605
I mean, not like my girlfriend...

695
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:42,285
That's... that's too fast. I know.
Eh... No pressure. Just...

696
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:44,525
If you wanted to be, like,
a significant other, then...

697
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:47,405
Wow. That sounds like marriage.
I don't wanna get married.

698
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:49,685
I mean, maybe one day,
with the right person.

699
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:51,965
Which could be you.
But not in a weird way. Okay.

700
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:54,365
