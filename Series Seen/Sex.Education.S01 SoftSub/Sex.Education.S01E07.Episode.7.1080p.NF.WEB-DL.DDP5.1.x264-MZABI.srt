00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,365
- Hey.
- Hey.

26
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:36,085
How are you?

27
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,485
I'm fine. Why?

28
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,485
What do you mean, why?
I’m asking how you are.

29
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,461
- That's not weird, that's normal.
- You've never asked me how I am before.

30
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,725
Bloody hell! I won't do it again, then.
Sorry for asking.

31
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,125
That's more like it.

32
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,405
Aww. Don't you want to live
happily ever after?

33
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:57,365
Please. Do I look like
I have a Cinderella complex?

34
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,885
Are you going?

35
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:03,045
It's an appropriated American tradition
that celebrates sexism

36
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,205
and peddles an unrealistic portrayal
of romantic love. So, no.

37
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:08,925
Agreed. Ritualized teenage fun sucks.

38
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:15,405
Eric would have forced me to go.
He loves that stuff.

39
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:19,485
- He genuinely has a Cinderella complex.
- Have you apologized yet?

40
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,485
Yeah, I tried,
but he's still not talking to me.

41
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,725
He'll come round. Maybe.

42
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:30,725
Anyway, your 8:30 awaits.

43
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:36,645
- Thanks. See you later.
- Good luck.

44
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:37,725
See you later.

45
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:46,605
I don't understand why Lizzie
doesn’t want to go to the ball with me.

46
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,925
I have tried every romantic gesture
in the book.

47
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:51,805
Have you tried asking her?

48
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,045
That was the first thing I did.

49
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:58,805
She said that she was flattered,
but she wasn't dating.

50
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,885
- Okay.
- But things change, though.

51
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,405
And she was flattered.

52
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:07,085
Well, I know it’s hard, but if you've
asked her and she's said no,

53
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:09,365
then I think you've got your answer.

54
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:13,285
But maybe her dad squished
the message on the cake with his foot,

55
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:15,445
so she doesn't know
that I’m still interested?

56
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,085
You said you sent her a letter,

57
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:22,125
Yeah, it was full of glitter
and green Jelly Babies.

58
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:23,325
I know that she likes them.

59
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,725
But the post is unreliable.
It might not have arrived.

60
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:30,805
And you also spelt out "I love you"
on her lawn in leaves?

61
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:33,701
- Yeah, but that could have blown away.
- I think the answer's no, Liam.

62
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,765
But she hasn't actually said no.

63
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,605
And girls love big gestures, right?

64
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,645
Like Jackson singing to Maeve Wiley,
and now they're together.

65
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:43,885
That's different.
Maeve actually likes Jackson.

66
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:46,925
It would have been inappropriate

67
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:49,005
if Jackson had continued
to make grand gestures

68
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:52,565
to a girl who made it clear
she wasn't interested.

69
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,925
Do you understand, Liam?

70
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:56,605
No means no.

71
00:03:58,165 --> 00:03:59,645
Unless it means yes.

72
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:05,885
Okay, let's... um...
let's go through this again.

73
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,765
Hey! What time
shall I pick you up tonight?

74
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,245
- What for?
- For the ball.

75
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,085
I’m not going to the ball.

76
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,685
Course you are. We're going together.

77
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:28,085
What about me says school dance?

78
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:30,525
But...

79
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,445
I bought a suit,
I got you a corsage.

80
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,685
You got me a flower handcuff,
but forgot to invite me?

81
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,205
Yeah... We're going out.

82
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,085
I thought it was a given.

83
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:44,605
Oh, come on. I've been
really looking forward to this.

84
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:49,365
- Mm-hmm?
- Me and you, dancin', havin' fun?

85
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,125
You know what fun is, right?

86
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,501
- It's what people our age do sometimes...
- Yeah, very funny.

87
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,045
Come on, it won't be good without you.

88
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,405
Come on, please?

89
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,125
- Fine.
- Yes!

90
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:04,005
No selfies, or slow dances,
or soppy song requests.

91
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,085
Okay, yeah, cool.

92
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,685
- I'll pick you up at 7:30.
- Mm.

93
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:12,285
- Wait, you do have a dress, right?
- Yeah, course. I'm not a troglodyte.

94
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,165
Yeah!

95
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:18,765
Shit...

96
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:47,845
Ah...

97
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,525
<i>Yeah.</i>

98
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:57,125
- Hello, Jakob.
- <i>Yeah, hello.</i>

99
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,445
I seem to have broken my kitchen tap.

100
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,685
- Who is this?
<i>- Jean.</i>

101
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:05,925
Jean Milburn?
You did my bathroom recently.

102
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,005
Yeah. I remember.

103
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:10,805
Do you think you could possibly
come and fix it?

104
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,565
<i>No, I can't. I'm busy.</i>

105
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:15,565
Er... Okay. Well, it's not an emergency.

106
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:18,005
Tomorrow?

107
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:20,445
Well, I'll check my schedule
and get back to you.

108
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:21,685
<i>Goodbye.</i>

109
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:29,405
Sorry. Work stuff.

110
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,285
And, uh...

111
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:36,805
why do you think Moordale
would be a good fit for you, young lady?

112
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,165
To be honest,

113
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:40,525
my current school is in administration

114
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:43,605
because the headmistress
embezzled our finances.

115
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:47,365
She's on the run now in Mexico
with our geography substitute, Mr Peabody.

116
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:51,685
So, I kind of need a new school.
For, like, education.

117
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,445
It's true!

118
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,485
Well...
honesty is exactly the kind of attribute

119
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,645
we look for in this institution.

120
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:07,845
Also, your grades are very impressive,
and we are aiming to improve our average.

121
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,765
Come on.

122
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,885
Ola? What are you doing here?

123
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:30,605
Uh... I'm looking for a new school.
Your headmaster is considering me.

124
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,285
Although he's a very rigid man.

125
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,805
Like a living Easter Island statue.

126
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,965
- Yeah.
- Stop flirting now. Come on.

127
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,325
Just wait in the van.
I'll be there in a minute.

128
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,085
You never called.

129
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:48,805
Yeah, I, um...

130
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:52,245
I composed a bunch of texts,
and after reading them,

131
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,125
I just felt immensely uncool.

132
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:57,005
So, I decided to not text you anything.

133
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,605
I'm an idiot, sorry.

134
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,965
I heard the Untouchables
are coming in a limousine!

135
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:05,765
Oh, my God! If I had a limousine, I would
totally have sex in it and film it.

136
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:08,205
School dance tonight.

137
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,765
Right. Are you going?

138
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:13,845
It’s an appropriated American tradition
that celebrates sexism

139
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,285
and peddles an unrealistic portrayal
of romantic love, so...

140
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,365
I like dances.

141
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,085
You do?

142
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,445
Yeah, I think dancing's fun.

143
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:27,245
Anyway, I'd better go. Bye, Otis.

144
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:29,325
See you.

145
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,245
Ola!

146
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:36,405
Ola, uh...

147
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,445
Do you... do you want
to go to the dance with me?

148
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:41,725
- Yes.
- Yeah.

149
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,805
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

150
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:46,005
Well, um, it starts at eight, I think.

151
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:48,085
So, aim to get there for seven?

152
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,165
I'll pick you up at 6:30. On time's late.

153
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,365
- I'll meet you at yours at seven.
- Okay.

154
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,445
Okay.

155
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:21,565
Eric!

156
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:24,925
- You forgot the shopping list.
- Oh, Mum.

157
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,101
I called Headmaster Groff.

158
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,245
He said that you can go
to the dance tonight if you want to.

159
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:34,565
- I don't.
- Maybe you can come to church with us?

160
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,965
I don't go to church anymore, Mum.

161
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:38,885
Hm?

162
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,805
Everyone loves you.

163
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,805
So, how's it lookin'?

164
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:05,925
Well, you look like an angry aubergine.

165
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,565
Yeah, well I can’t afford it anyway, so...

166
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,845
Can't Action Man buy you a dress?

167
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,565
His name is Jackson.
And, no, I'm not his housewife.

168
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,005
Why does he annoy you so much?

169
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,845
He doesn't. I actually quite like him.

170
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,765
I'm just not sure
he's the right guy for you, that's all.

171
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,725
Try this one. It's a little bit less
magician's assistant.

172
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,085
I'm happy with Jackson, all right?

173
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,125
Well, fine. Have a lovely life
watching Sergeant Do-Good swim

174
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:36,645
while you raise an army
of his perfect children.

175
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:37,845
Whatever.

176
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,325
- Well?
- Yeah, it’s actually nice.

177
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,205
I told you my price limit.
This is way too expensive.

178
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:00,885
Sean?

179
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:14,645
<i>Hello. I am so sorry
for interrupting your shopping today,</i>

180
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:20,765
<i>but my little sister, Maeve, is going
to her first school dance tonight</i>

181
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:24,965
<i>and she has just found the perfect dress.</i>

182
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,605
<i>There she is! Come on out, Maeve. Come on.</i>

183
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,045
<i>Doesn’t she look so pretty?</i>

184
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,605
<i>Except, the problem is,
we can't afford this dress,</i>

185
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,805
<i>because, recently...</i>

186
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:40,965
<i>we were orphaned.</i>

187
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:46,445
<i>Earlier this year, our dad,
who served this country bravely,</i>

188
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:52,285
<i>died in combat and
our mum passed shortly after.</i>

189
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,085
<i>Cancer.</i>

190
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:59,885
<i>But if they had been here today
to see my little sister,</i>

191
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:04,885
<i>they would have been so proud
of their little girl.</i>

192
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:11,925
<i>Now, I know it's unorthodox,
but if you could give anything,</i>

193
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:18,325
<i>then we might be able to help my sister
get the dress of her dreams.</i>

194
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:20,365
<i>Thank you.</i>

195
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,965
What is your problem?
You can't say we're orphans!

196
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:30,525
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you rather I told them

197
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:33,245
that Mum's a junkie
and that Dad fucked off?

198
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,005
I don't think they would have enjoyed
that story as much.

199
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:39,405
We were born alone
and we will die alone

200
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:42,165
so we might as well get
what we can along the way.

201
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,165
You're welcome.

202
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:07,005
Hey, man,
do you know how to get to Ellencot?

203
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:10,885
I’m trying to get to get to a wedding
reception and my GPS totally screwed me.

204
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,125
Um...

205
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,445
Yeah. Uh...

206
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:21,205
Yeah... Yeah, you...
You're going in the right direction.

207
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:24,445
Um, it's that way,
uh, it's about 15 minutes.

208
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,245
Take a left at the primary school.

209
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,245
- Okay. Thanks, man.
- Uh...

210
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,045
Your nails are fierce.

211
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:33,765
Thanks, kid.

212
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,805

00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,965

- School dance.

00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:25,805

227
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:30,845
Hey! Um... Wow. Okay... You look cool.

228
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:34,445
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you. You look great yourself.

229
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:35,645
Thanks.

230
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,045
I'm here for the sink.

231
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,925
- Great. Marvelous.
- Okay.

232
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,405

00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,405
Do you want to come in for a bit?

235
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,325
- No, we're good. See you.
- Okay.

236
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,605
- Bye.
- Bye, have a lovely time.

237
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,285
- Mum, actually...
- Yeah?

238
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:59,925
Uh, do you think maybe
you could not sleep with Ola's dad?

239
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,725
It's gonna make things
super awkward for me.

240
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,405
I would never. Don't be silly. Um...

241
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,685
Completely inappropriate.

242
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,485
- Okay.
- Have a lovely time.

243
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,965
Aww! You both look so smart.

244
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:18,005
Okay, a little closer together now.

245
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:23,805
Closer!

246
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,285
Put your arm round him, love.

247
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,205
Go on. Give him a proper hug!

248
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:33,165

249
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,645
Hold on.

250
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,805
Christ!
Just take the bloody photo, Maureen.

251
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,565
- Lies!
- Rubbish!

252
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,925
- Ooh!
- Someone's looking groovy!

253
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,005
Mum!

254
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,925
Groovy is not a thing.
It hasn't been for a long time.

255
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,805
Come here.

256
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,445

257
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:05,925

258
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,965
Mwah!

259
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,165
- You look great.
- Thanks.

260
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:10,725
- See you soon.
- Remember to be back at 10:30, yes?

261
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,845
- What? Why?
- You've got training tomorrow morning.

262
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,525
Yeah, but I thought
I could, you know... take tomorrow off.

263
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:19,405
- Why would you think that?
- Because of the dance.

264
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,525
I'm sure he can take tomorrow off.

265
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,325
No, he can't.

266
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:27,325
Can't I just have one fun night?
I never do this kind of thing.

267
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:31,965
Look, you will thank me in a few years.
See you at 10:30. Go on. Have a good time.

Um...

285
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:34,285
I didn't want to break your mother's heart
by telling her the truth.

286
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,285

00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:58,765
- I just wanna have a good time.
- Yeah.

293
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,565
We have the cheapest vodka available.

294
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:04,365
It's pretty much paint stripper,
but I promise you it'll do a job.

295
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,085
- Yeah.
- No. You're driving.

296
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,565
No, no. I'll drive. That's fine.

297
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:10,485

your alcoholic beverage

312

Sean...

315
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:16,005
Oh, come on. I wanna see
all my old teachers' faces.

316
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,405
I'll be in and out in a flash, I promise.

317
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,045
Is Hendricks still sober?
Or has he fallen off the old wagon again?

318
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,406
Wonder if he still uses Lynx Africa
to cover up the smell.

319
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,245
- Sean! Wait!
- Hey.

320
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,205
He's all right. Look,
let's just have a good time, okay?

321
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,125
- Hey.
- Hm.

322
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,325
Come on.

323
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,165
- Let’s get a photo.
- I said no photos.

324
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,925
Oh, come on.

325
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:45,725
Let's do ironic faces. I bet you
no one will have thought of that.

326
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,365
- Hey.
- Hi.

327
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,245
- Cool, hi.
- You're... you're here.

328
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,565
And you're here.

329
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:59,325
- I'm Ola.
- Jackson.

330
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,461
- Sorry.
- Nice to meet you.

331
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:03,285
- You too.
- Ola, this... this is Maeve.

332
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:04,365
- Hi.
- Hi.

333
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:05,565
She's my friend, she's...

334
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,325
- Er... I should...
- So...

335
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:14,445
We should go. I've lost my brother.

336
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,005
- Are we not gonna get a photo?
- No.

337
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:17,285
- Okay.
- Uh...

338
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,485
- They seem cool.
- Uh, yeah.

339
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,125
Yeah, they are.

340
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:29,605
L-O-V-E. Love!

341
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,565
- Love. That word?
- Praise Jesus!

342
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:32,645
Love!

343
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:34,165
- Again!
- Love!

344
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,085
Jesus loves!

345
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,125
His love is greater than fear.

346
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:44,725
- Yes, Pastor!
- His love is stronger than uncertainty.

347
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:48,245
His love is deeper than hate.

348
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:49,805
- Amen.
- Jesus said,

349
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,125
"Love your neighbor as yourself."

350
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:56,245
Yourself.

351
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:59,045
Yourself.

352
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,965
Love starts here.

353
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:06,165
- We must all learn to love ourselves...
- Amen!

354
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,485
...before we truly love others.

355
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:12,285
Who are you to not love yourself?

356
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:15,325
Praise be!

357
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,565

- 14 years.

375
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:24,485
We moved just after Otis was born.

376
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:29,285
Is it "we" as in ex-husband?

377
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

378
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:36,605
So, why did you divorce?

379
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,285
You ask a lot of questions.

380
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:42,045
And you don't answer many…
Is that a therapist thing?

381
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:45,685
- Does it bother you that I'm a therapist?
- No.

382
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:49,165
Some men feel... observed.

383
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:52,685
What have you observed...

384
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:55,085
about me?

385
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,285
That you look nice in yellow.

386
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,725
Well, in the little time
that we've known each other,

387
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:05,365
I'd say that you're also divorced,

388
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:09,445
that monogamy is a little too... binding,

389
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:12,205
makes you feel your age.

390
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,085
From your tattoos
and lack of driving license,

391
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:20,005
I'd say you're impulsive,

392
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,525
maybe even reckless.

393
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:27,645
And you do this quite often,
romancing your customers.

394
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,645
That soup was a nice touch, by the way.

395
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:38,125
And then you move on to the next conquest,
before it gets too intimate.

396
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,005
- Mm. Interesting.
- Close?

397
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:43,725
No.

398
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,405
Not really.

399
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:51,005
I was married...

400
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,085
but my wife died.

401
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:02,125
She was sick for a very long time.

402
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:08,125
And Ola, my daughter, helped me
to take care of her when I couldn't.

403
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:16,165
You're the first one I've had sex with
since it happened.

404
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:20,525
I wasn't planning on it.

405
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:26,645
But you're right,
I can be, uh... impulsive.

406
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:30,045
I really like you, Jean.

407
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:36,805
I would like to get to know you better.

408
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:43,605
I'm sorry if I've given you
the wrong idea.

409
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:53,805
Yeah.

410
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:05,125

00:28:58,205 --> 00:28:59,605
So, how long have you known Otis?

478
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:02,965
My dad's been fixing their bathroom.
Otis asked me out.

479
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,165
- He's funny, isn't he?
- Yeah.

480
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,325
Yeah, he is.

481
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:14,005
But, um, just between you and me,
he's, um...

482
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,405
he's like, really inexperienced.

483
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:20,725
He hasn't had sex or anything yet. He's
a bit confused about all that stuff, so...

484
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:23,845
don’t be surprised
if he doesn’t seem keen.

485
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:26,645
See you later.

486
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,605
Cheers, boy. Have fun, guys.

487
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:48,045

Long time no see, mate!

488
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,645
Sean Wiley, I want you off school grounds.

489
00:29:51,285 --> 00:29:54,525
Don't be like that. Come on.
What's goin' on with you? Let's catch up!

490
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:56,645
You are not welcome on this campus.

491
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:59,805

Oh. Well, I hope he crashes it!

504
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:49,925
Give me a kiss.

505
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:53,045
- Okay.
- Okay.

506
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,525
- Whoa. I'm a little bit drunk.

00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:56,685

00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:58,205
This is a shit-show, right?

509
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,685
Did you guys see Ola?

510
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:00,805
- Oh, yeah...
- No.

511
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,485
No.

512
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,005
Okay. Um... Alright.

513
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:11,125
Oh, I don't feel so good.

514
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,405
- You gonna be sick?
- Yeah.

515
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:14,645
Okay. Come on.

516
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,245
Ola?

517
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:41,565
- Hi.
- Hey.

518
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:44,165
Found the, uh... art.

519
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:45,245
Yeah.

520
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:47,445
I did.

521
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:50,165
Some of these are quite good.

522
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:54,845
Well, it's, uh... Moordale's finest.

523
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:58,485
I mean, this one's my favorite.

524
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:02,285
Wow, yeah.

525
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:06,725
I've never...

526
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:09,805
I've never slept with anyone before,
by the way.

527
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,525
Okay. Um...

528
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,245
Why did you tell me that?

529
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:17,965
Just wanted you to know.

530
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:19,765
Okay.

531
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:27,045
But... Did you and Maeve,
like, date or something?

532
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:29,565
I'm picking up a vibe.

533
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,085
No.

534
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:34,245
Maeve is not the sort of person
who would, you know, date me.

535
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:35,805
What does that mean?

536
00:32:36,085 --> 00:32:40,925
Well, um... Maeve is considerably
higher up on the food chain than I am.

537
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:43,885
You know, I'm like a kangaroo
or an armadillo.

538
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:47,485
Whereas Maeve's like a panther,
or a lion, even.

539
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,741
- So what am I on the food chain?
- You could be like...

540
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:53,245
You know those goats that stand on really
steep cliffs and just kind of stick?

541
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:56,005
- I'm a goat?
- No! I mean, you don't look like a goat.

542
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:59,605
You could be, like, a house cat,
if you don't like goats.

543
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:02,525
You know, the skinny ones
that just stare at you.

544
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:05,445
Okay, I'm a skinny house cat,
and she's a lion.

545
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,685
Oh, no. Maeve is unattainable,

546
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,725
- and you're...
- You're not a kangaroo, Otis.

547
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,165
You're an arsehole.

548
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:13,965
Ola! I mean...

549
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,485
Fucking idiot.

550
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,165
Eric, wait!

551
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:37,045
- Are you sure you want to go in like this?
- Yes.

552
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:39,605
- Are you sure you're sure?
- Yes.

553
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:42,685
Why? What's wrong with it?

554
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:44,285
Wait a second, please.

555
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,925
- When I first came to this country...
- Oh, Dad!

556
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:50,885
...I had to do so much to fit in.

557
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,485
- I never wanted the same for my children.
- Okay!

558
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,085
I wanted you to be proud and strong.

559
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,765
But you are... so different.

560
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,845
It makes me feel scared for you.

561
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:06,485
Your fear doesn't help me, Dad.
It makes me feel weak.

562
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:09,285
But why...

563
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:12,605
do you have to be so much?

564
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,045
This is me.

565
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:20,085
I don't want you to be hurt.

566
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:23,805
Look, I'll be hurt either way.
Isn't it better to be who I am?

567
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,965
I told you to wait!

568
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,765
I just shouted at that man.

569
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:37,165
Yeah.

570
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:40,325
Yeah, you did.

571
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:43,845
Maybe...

572
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,365
I am learning from my brave son.

573
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:53,045
Dad.

574
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:17,965
What the fuck did you come as,
Tromboner? A girl?

575
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:20,685
- What do you want, Adam?
- I’m gonna fucking kill you.

576
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:26,045
Okay. Are you gonna do it now
or later?

577
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,685
Because I'm ready when you are.

578
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,445
- It's comin'.
- Okay.

579
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:33,525
So, later, then?

580
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,565

No!

645
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:31,165
Uh...

646
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,045
Liam. Get down, now!

647
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,565
Not until I speak to Lizzie!

648
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:41,445

00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:45,045

00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,125
No.

652
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:49,325
- Come down this instant!
- No.

653
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:50,405
Enough!

654
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:51,845
Get down, now!

655
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:54,885
What’s the point? Lizzie doesn't love me.

656
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,405
Nobody loves me.

657
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,605
I'm gonna jump!

658
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:03,365
Stop. Liam, don't!

659
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:05,885
Don't do this.

660
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:09,605
Oh... Hi, Otis.

661
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:15,405
You don't wanna jump.

662
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:18,405
No! I think I do.

663
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:19,845
You don't. Look...

664
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:24,645
sometimes, the people we like
don't like us back,

665
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,245
and it's painful, but there's nothing
we can do about it.

666
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,845
- You don't understand.
- I do. I do understand.

667
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:34,605
I know what it's like when someone doesn't
feel the same way about you. It's...

668
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:37,565
Someone you can't stop
thinking about…

669
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,645
It hurts.

670
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,125
But you can't make people like you.

671
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,285
I don't like her.

672
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:48,765
I love her.

673
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:53,765
I know.
But love isn't about grand gestures,

674
00:40:53,845 --> 00:40:55,605
or the moon and the stars.

675
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:56,805
It's just dumb luck.

676
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:59,965
And sometimes, you meet someone
who feels the same way.

677
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,845
And, sometimes, you're unlucky.

678
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:05,365
But one day, you're gonna meet someone
who appreciates you for who you are.

679
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:08,005
I mean, there's seven billion people
on the planet.

680
00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:11,765
I know one of them
is gonna climb up on a moon for you.

681
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:15,045
- Really?
- Yeah, you're brilliant!

682
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:17,485
You're... very dedicated.

683
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,885
You're gonna make someone
really happy one day.

684
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,525
But it will not be me!

685
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,165
Not Lizzie,
definitely not Lizzie, but someone.

686
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,925
And it won't happen
if you fall off that moon and die.

687
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:34,445
Okay.

688
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,925
Sorry. It's fine.

689
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:56,445
I'm fine.

690
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:01,245
Okay, everyone.
It's time for the Macarena!

691
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,045

Where's your date?

719
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:10,085
- She left.
- Why?

720
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:12,165
We... had an argument.

Okay.

723
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:22,885
That was pretty crazy in there.
You were amazing.

724
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:26,125
That was serious, Maeve.

725
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:29,645
- I mean, he could have killed himself.
- Yeah, but you talked him down.

726
00:44:29,685 --> 00:44:31,605
Yeah, and he was up there
after he spoke to me.

727
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:33,005
Imagine if he'd died.

728
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:36,285
I think this is wrong.

729
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,685
- What's wrong?
- This is. The... clinic.

730
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,245
And us. It... has to stop.

731
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:46,965
- But we’re really good together.
- I can't keep doing this anymore, Maeve.

732
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:49,725
- It's getting in the way of my life.
- What do you mean?

733
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:51,765
You know what I mean.

734
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:54,085
Maeve?

735
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:55,325
Just a minute, Jackson.

736
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:03,485
Hey, Otis. If I give you another 50,
will you tell me how

737
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:05,405
- to get Maeve to like me again?
- Jackson!

738
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,925
- What are you talking about?
- Well, he told me how to get you.

739
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,605
I gave him 50 and then
he gave me the book stuff,

740
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:15,445
and then the song and then
the feminist stuff that you like.

741
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:19,925
Because you're difficult, Maeve, to know.

742
00:45:23,405 --> 00:45:24,565
Maeve...

743
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:27,845
He paid you to tell him what I like?

744
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,165
No. I didn't...

745
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:34,805
I tried to not take...
I gave the money to you!

746
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:35,885
You gave it to me?

747
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:39,845
I’m gonna be sick again.

748
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,285
- Maeve. I...
- Stay the fuck away.

749
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:44,205
You’re right. We’re done.

750
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:52,845
I'm so sorry, Maeve.

751
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:55,365
I'm so sorry.

752
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:57,405
You're so nice.

753
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:00,885
Sorry if I got, like,
sick on you and stuff.

754
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,485
I'm sorry.

755
00:46:03,365 --> 00:46:04,445
I'm so sorry.

756
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:07,605
Oh. Did we forget the car?

757
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:09,485
- Sh, Jackson...
- Where's the...

758
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,285
He's a bit drunk.
My brother will bring the car...

759
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:27,445
Jackson?

760
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:32,445
What were you thinking?

761
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:36,645
Do you think I like getting up
at 4:30 every morning,

762
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:39,165
like I have got nothing better
to do with my time?

763
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:41,725
- Oh, me, me, me.
- What did you just say?

764
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,805
It’s all about you. Isn't it, Mum?

765
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,445
Er, look... Let's go to bed.
We can talk about this in the morning.

766
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:50,125
- Fine.
- No, seriously.

767
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:55,085
You think we like driving five hours every
Saturday to get you to your swim meets?

768
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:57,605
Dedicating our entire lives
to your success?

769
00:46:57,685 --> 00:46:59,541
- It's not my success though, is it, Mum?
- What?

770
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:00,885
- It's yours.
- Ja...

771
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:02,805
- Jackson!
- Jackson!

772
00:47:02,925 --> 00:47:05,285
You get back here now! Get back here!

"Love isn't about the moon and the stars."

774

"It's about dumb luck".

775
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:12,045
- Shut up.
- You should start a motivational podcast,

776
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,885
- called <i>The Teen Whisperer.</i>
- I am never going to a dance again.

777
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,725
Yeah, no, you suck at dances. Okay?

778
00:47:16,805 --> 00:47:18,285
I'm hungry, but... Oh.

779
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:22,045
Hello.

780
00:47:23,565 --> 00:47:25,805
- Dave?
- Er, close. Dan.

781
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:30,565
- I ride the motorbike?
- Yes, right. Mother issues.

782
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:34,445
- Well, I wouldn't...
<i>- Dan, are you coming back to bed?</i>

783
00:47:34,525 --> 00:47:37,765
Oh, excuse me. Looks like my mum needs me.
<i>Your </i>mum needs me.

784
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:38,845
She's...

785
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:41,525
Okay, I'm just gonna, er...

786
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,061
- Oh, that's probably... Yeah.
- Yeah.

787
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:44,085
Okay.

788
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:45,885
- Toast?
- Yeah.

789
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:48,805
Aww.

790
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,925
Your new dad seems so sweet.

791
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:53,485
Hah.

792
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:58,285
- Have you got any Nutella?
- Yeah.

793
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:24,565
Come on.

794
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,485
I was selling, they were buying.
What did you want me to do?

795
00:48:27,565 --> 00:48:29,565
I dunno.
For you to take some responsibility?

796
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:32,925
Responsibility?
Who looked after you when Mum left?

797
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:35,285
Who cooked, cleaned and
dropped out of school for you?

798
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:37,405
Don't kid yourself.
You did not drop out for me.

799
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:41,525
Maybe it's the fuzz.

800
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:43,485
Piss off, Sean.

801
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:50,845
What do you want?

802
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:53,445
Someone pay you
to read the fucking <i>Bell Jar?</i>

803
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:56,325
- I actually liked that book.
- Not the point.

804
00:48:57,005 --> 00:48:59,805
I had a fight with my mum.
It was bad.

805
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:02,581
What do you want me to do?
Just go home and apologize.

806
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,845
No, I can't! I can't go home!

807
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:06,685
I hate it.

808
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:10,845
I feel like... yeah, like...
like I'm suffocating.

809
00:49:10,925 --> 00:49:14,405
Like I'm livin' in somebody else's body.
Like, trapped in somebody else's life.

810
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:17,045
- Hey, it's okay.
- I don't know what to fucking do.

811
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:19,445
It's okay.

812
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:21,965
It's okay.

813
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:29,125
Please, can I stay... here, with you?

814
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:32,365
Yeah? Okay.

815
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:37,885
