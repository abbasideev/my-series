00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,205
How's that? Is that good for you?

2
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,325
Not really.
You're just dry humping my leg.

3
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:16,285
Okay, um, let's switch positions.

- Hey.

39
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,765
- You're in love with Maeve.
- What?

40
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,925
- I'm not... I'm not in love.
- Mm-hm.

41
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:10,885
Don't be ridiculous.

42
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,101
You’ve been glued to your phone
for, like, three weeks,

43
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,805
and every time she texts you,
this happens.

44
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,741
- What happens? Oh, sorry.
- Watch it, breadstick.

45
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:17,925
Okay. Have a nice day.

46
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,565
This! You turn into smiley,
happy cupcake Otis. It’s weird.

47
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:23,205
I don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:25,661
Maeve and I are work colleagues
and we're friends. That’s it.

49
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,485
- Yeah. Friends.
- Boys and girls can be friends.

50
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,765
Yeah, sure. Their genitals can be friends.

51
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:33,005
I thought you said Maeve was
with Jackson now, anyway.

52
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,925
They're not with each other.
They’re just, you know...

53
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,805
Having super-hot, athletic,
sweaty intercourse?

54
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,405
- Casual sex.
- Uh! Uh!

55
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,085
You seem to know a lot
about her relationship status.

56
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,805
Yes, because we're friends
and friends share things.

57
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:47,005
Like bodily fluids?

58
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,565
Hey, look.

59
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:50,925
- Still looking for a job?
- Hah, yeah.

60
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,685
Nice try, but you can't distract me

61
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,925
from the fact
that you're clearly in love with Maeve!

62
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,605
- That was good.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:40,405
I haven’t seen you for a while. I thought
you didn't wanna hook up anymore.

64
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,045
- I've been busy.
- All right.

65
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,325
Do you wanna hang out later?

66
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,165
- We just had sex.
- I mean, like...

67
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,485
You know, hang out.

68
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:52,805
Jackson, I’m not offended
that you wanna keep this a secret.

69
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,245
It’s casual and it works for me.

70
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:56,925
You don't have to try
and be honorable and shit. Okay?

71
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:58,645
See you later.

72
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,725
Sh...

73
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,485
Oh, my God. Jackson is so hot.

74
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:15,205
Jackson is looking at us. God.

75
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,885
- Jackson's approaching us.
- Mind if I join you?

76
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,245
- Jackson is here.
- Uh...

77
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:22,845
- You know Maeve, right?
- Nah.

78
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:24,405
Yes, you do. He does.

79
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:27,845
Well, yeah, I mean... we're friends.
We're just friends, you know.

80
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,405
- Hey, man, I'm...
- Handsome.

81
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,485
- Sorry, you are...
- Eric.

82
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:34,405
Eric.

83
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,605
Some people know me as Tromboner.

84
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,125
- So, I need your help.
- Me?

85
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:42,685
I mean... me?

86
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,365
- Well, Maeve and I, we're, you know...
- Boning.

87
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:46,645
Yeah. And it's great.

88
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:49,605
But I've sort of realized that I want her
to hang around with me more.

89
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,325
- Mm.
- You know, afterwards.

90
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:54,205
- After the boning. Mm.
- Yeah, so I thought you could help me out.

91
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:57,605
You want him to help you get Maeve
to be your girlfriend?

92
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:58,685
Yeah.

93
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,045
Yeah, I don't really know what I can do.

94
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,125
So...

95
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:04,221
- Well, I mean, you're her friend.
- You're her friend?

96
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,445
And I heard you
sort of give out sex advice.

97
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,285
- Yeah, he does.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:11,245
So I thought
you were the right person to talk to.

99
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:15,125
I mean, I can pay, if that's the problem.

100
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:17,045
- I...
- Oh, shit, I've gotta run.

101
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,461
- Let’s catch up later.
- Wait, no.

102
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,485
- I really appreciate this, man. Take care.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:21,565
This...

104
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,125
Is that Jackson's new girlfriend?

105
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,925
Oh! Ha! You are like a pimp.

106
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,005
And not the cool Snoop Dogg kind.

107
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,325
Hm!

108
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,645
D.

109
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:44,685
D.

110
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,125
E.

111
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,165
And on this one
you just drew a picture of a...

112
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,405
That's a... It's a woman's behind.

113
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,125
There. There's a...

114
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,485
- That's a bumhole, there's a vagina.
- You won't be laughing

115
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,165
when you throw yourself off
a motorway bridge at the age of 35

116
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:02,325
because of the failure you have become!

117
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:08,965
I have spoken to the dean
at Mountview Military this morning.

118
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,525
- Dad, I...
- Your name is on the waiting list.

119
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,885
You have until the end of term to get
these grades up and change my mind.

120
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:37,285
Sorry I'm late. I had a, uh...

121
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,365
Had a thing.

122
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,925
Get it together, we've got clients.

123
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,765
Roger. Affirmative. Good to go.

124
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,525
It’s like the more we try,
the worse it gets.

125
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,685
Like we can't get in sync
or find a rhythm.

126
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:55,005
When we're having sex, I feel like
I've never seen a vagina before.

127
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:57,165
But I have, I've got one
and I've looked at it a lot.

128
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:59,901
It's got to the point where when
I think about touching Ruthie,

129
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:02,405
I get really panicked, because
I know it's gonna be really bad.

130
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,365
Like when you put together
a bookshelf from IKEA

131
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:06,285
and you realize
you don’t have the right screw

132
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,925
and the whole thing was a waste of time

133
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,805
and then you just hate everything
about Sweden.

134
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:13,325
- Ruthie, tell him how bad it is.
- Look, I don't know why we're doing this.

135
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,245
It's not like some advice
from a 16-year-old straight dude

136
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,645
is gonna magically fix us.

137
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,165
It’s stupid.

138
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:21,725
Yeah, well, I mean, you're right, Ruthie.

139
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,485
I'm not particularly well-versed

140
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,885
in the intricacies
of lesbian sexual relations,

141
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,165
but I think,

142
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:30,845
if I can learn a bit more about your
emotional relationship to one another,

143
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,285
I might be able to get closer
to the root of the problem.

144
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,565
We don’t have a problem
with our relationship.

145
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,045
We're in love and it's great.

146
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:39,685
We're just...

147
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:41,205
inexperienced.

148
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,405
This is my first lesbian relationship.

149
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:44,885
Me too.

150
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,525
First, I mean,
lesbian sex therapy session.

151
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,365
So have you got any ideas, Kinsey?

152
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,885
I'd like to have an orgasm
sometime this century.

153
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:53,885
Yeah, leave it with me.

154
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:56,245
I’ll do some research
and see what I can come up with.

155
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,325
Yeah, brilliant.

156
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,445
Thanks, thank you.

157
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,125
How'd it go?

158
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,565
Might be a tricky one.

159
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,525
Ah...

160
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,285
I'm so sorry.

161
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,925
I'm sorry, I'm coming down with something.
Nothing serious, though.

162
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:23,965
Do you want to come in
and we can get started?

163
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,565
- I'm just gonna grab my...
- Follow me.

164
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,205
Have a seat.

165
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,165
I won't bite.

166
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:49,805
So...

167
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:51,645
scrotal anxiety.

168
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,285
Your email implies you've been struggling
with this for a while.

169
00:08:56,445 --> 00:09:00,725
Why don't you start by telling me
your earliest memory of your scrotum?

170
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,165
Oh, goodness.

171
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,885
I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

172
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,125
I, uh...

173
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:10,245
- I'm having my bathroom redone.
- Yeah, I know.

174
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:12,045
I have my tools outside.

175
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:15,845
So I'd better go and get them, right?

176
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,325
Earliest memory,

177
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,525
I'd just turned five.

178
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:28,085
And I was looking down,

179
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,765
and thought,

180
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,205
"Oh, there are my balls."

181
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,845
The topic for this year's sixth form
essay competition is

182
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:44,645
"Every great dream
begins with a dreamer."

183
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:45,925
Entry is compulsory.

184
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:49,005
This is a fantastic opportunity
that could look very good

185
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,085
on your university applications
next year.

186
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,805
Are any of you even listening?
No, I didn't think so. Anyway...

187
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,325
Here's some more information.
Take it or leave it.

188
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:00,565
I'll be interested to see your take
on this, Maeve. Genuinely.

189
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,861
- I'm giving the money back.
- No, hold up.

190
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:16,125
You have a rare opportunity here to use
your power for self-interest.

191
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:17,085
What do you mean?

192
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,045
You keep the money. Give Jackson
the wrong advice. Make trouble.

193
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,565
Okay, that is unethical

194
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,085
- on so many levels.
- Oh!

195
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,605
Yeah, unethical or...

196
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,085
badass?

197
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,261
- Completely unethical.
- Ugh!

198
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,885
Eric, I'm giving the money back.

199
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:31,845
Okay? End of story.

200
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,405
Well, after you then, Captain Morality.

201
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:37,885
<i>Otis!</i>

202
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,245
You tracked me down.

203
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,925
Listen, I...
I need to give this back to you.

204
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,965
I feel uncomfortable talking
behind Maeve’s back. It’s wrong.

205
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,165
It's unethical and it's just wrong.

206
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:48,845
- I get it.
- All right, cool.

207
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,605
Yeah. No problem. You're an honorable guy.

208
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:54,165
- Great. Here's the money.
- Maeve is such a head-fuck, man.

209
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:57,285
Like a Rubik's Cube. She says one thing
and then does something else.

210
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,365
And I can't keep up.

211
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,525
- Know what I mean?
- Not really. But here you go.

212
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:02,045
We’ll have crazy amazing sex, yeah?

213
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,405
I'm talking, like,
transcendental-level shagging.

214
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:05,405
- Okay, stop!
- Aaah!

215
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:07,405
And then she ignores me for days.

216
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:11,405
But then, she wants to do it again
and round and round we go.

217
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:14,405
She's like some sexy merry-go-round,
and I can't get off.

218
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:15,605
She's not an object!

219
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,525
Ohh... What?

220
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,725
Uh... I said she's not an object.

221
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,885
You keep describing her
as inanimate objects, but she is a person.

222
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,661
Have you even thought
about asking her what she wants

223
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,805
or what she likes?

224
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,045
- Well, what does she like?
- Lots of things.

225
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,645
Um... Female writers, for a start.

226
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:32,925
Oh, like <i>The Hunger Games?</i>

227
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:36,645
More like, uh, Virginia Woolf
or Roxane Gay or Sylvia Plath.

228
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:40,645
She also has a great taste in music.
Joy Division, Nirvana, Bikini Kill...

229
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,765
But she's not a snob.
I mean, she'll listen to pop.

230
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,885
- And she has a really dark sense of humor.
- I didn't know that.

231
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,605
What are you... What are you doing?

232
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,765
I'm taking notes. This is super helpful.

233
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,565
No! No! I'm not helping.

234
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,325
- This is not helping.
- Yeah, it is.

235
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:56,125
Stop pulling your pricks and get out here!
40 lengths!

236
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,445
Get a move on, Jackson.

237
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,005
Thank you so much. You're a lifesaver.

238
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,005
- Take care.
- Yeah.

239
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:03,085
Bye, Jackson.

240
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:06,405
Oh, no.

241
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,125
Good job.

242
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:11,165
Good job.

252
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,165
You’re not actually reading
Virginia Woolf.

253
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,965
Why wouldn't I be? She's a brilliant mind.

254
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,005
Who’s the big-nosed chick?

255
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,965
A fierce, feminist voice
of 20th-century Britain, obviously.

256
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,501
I've never seen you read before.
Is this some kind of joke?

257
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,645
No! I read all the time.

258
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:55,845
Hey.

259
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,925
Do you know you are the only person

260
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:03,525
to take this book out of the library
since 1972?

261
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,245
Not anymore, apparently.

262
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,885
So now he's a feminist!

263
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,005
You've made the hottest guy in school
even hotter.

264
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,245
He's basically Ryan Gosling. Well done.

265
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,485
You don't understand. He's like a Jedi.

266
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:23,285
Okay? He just talked, and no matter
what I did, he got what he wanted.

267
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:26,445
The one thing you had going for you
was that you're all woke and shit.

268
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:29,285
Kind of counters
the whole lame virgin thing.

269
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,565
Now he's checking his privilege.
It's game over.

270
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,501
- It's not a game.
- It is a game.

271
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,805
- Because Maeve and I are just friends.
- Hm.

272
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:38,605
Anyway, she's not gonna fall
for this whole performance.

273
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,285
Oh, my God, I love Virginia Woolf.

274
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,845
Nice guys finish last.

275
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,565
Especially when there's a nicer guy
with rock-hard abs.

<i>♪ A kiss to build a dream on ♪</i>

277
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:57,845
Ruby thinks Kyle should change
the way he dresses,

278
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:59,405
but I think he looks nice.

279
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,605
He has been wearing
a lot of trackie bottoms recently,

280
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,605
but that's only
'cause he set his jeans on fire.

281
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,445
What?

282
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,205
He’s got second-degree burns
on his thighs,

283
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,566
but he was blazed when it happened,
so it only hurt a bit.

284
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,245
Hey, Maeve.

285
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,005
What do you think Woolf meant by,

286
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,765
"The history of men's opposition
to women's emancipation

287
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,925
is more interesting, perhaps, than
the story of that emancipation itself"?

288
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,965
That men are dicks,
and selective castration is our only hope.

289
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,725
You know, you are so dark.

290
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,405
- What?
- Your humor, it's dark. I like dark humor.

291
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:32,045
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

292
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,005
He's being so weird.

293
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:39,125
I think he’s peacocking.

294
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:40,805
But with words.

295
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:44,285

308
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:19,445

I've got an essay to write.

this morning, in your office.

I wrote that last book with my...

340
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:52,405
ex-husband.

341
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,045
And we split just after the publication.

342
00:16:56,365 --> 00:17:00,965
And I tried, but, to be honest, um...

343
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,045
the fear creeps in a bit as you get older.

344
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,805
I don't know why I'm telling you that.

345
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,165
Fuck fear.

346
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,205
I'm sorry?

347
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:12,765
Fuck the fear.

348
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:15,925
Tomorrow, you could be driving along
in your car, happily,

349
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:21,085
and then, uh, smash you, uh, head to head
with an 18-wheeler truck

350
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,085
and you're squished to the road,
and you're dead.

351
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,125
Just a waste of time.

352
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,245
So fuck fear.

353
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,205
Hello, darling.

354
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:34,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

355
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,405
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,565
- Homework stuff.
- Well...

357
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,805
I should leave you to it.

358
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:15,925
Sorry.

359
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,245
It's okay.

360
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:18,605
Hello!

361
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,445
Are you a friend of Otis'?

362
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,765
No, I'm here to pick up my father.

363
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,885
You know, intense European dude.
Thinks he’s a comedian.

364
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,925
Piercing blue eyes. He's got "fuck"
written across his hand...

365
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,965
Don't be a man-child,
get a move on. I'm late for work!

366
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:46,085
I am ignoring you. Hurry up.

367
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:49,965
Please can I use your bathroom?

368
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:51,965
Yes. It's upstairs.

369
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,285
Thanks.

370
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,685
Mum!

371
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,045
You're not my mum.

372
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,045
I just... I'm not...

373
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,245
This is research!

374
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,005
Uh...

375
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:19,485
You should probably think about
gettin' a lock on this door.

376
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:21,605
Where's the bathroom?

377
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:24,165
- Uh, on your left.
- Thanks.

378
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,205
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

379
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:35,925
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

380
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,605
Oh, don't annoy me.

381
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:39,965
How have you pooped?

382
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,045
Oh, yuck.

383
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,805
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck,
yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

384
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,965
Okay, stay.

385
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:48,245
Yeah, you should feel bad.

386
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,485
Ugh.

387
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:57,085
Uh... Francis, Bacon, get back here!

388
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:58,805
Oh! Come on! Come on!

389
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,085
What the hell?

390
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:02,405
Uh, Francis!

391
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,245
Bacon!

392
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,085
Shit.

393
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:11,845
Oh, okay. Come on, guys, come on.

394
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:13,645
Oh. Come on.

395
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,645
Hey.

396
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:20,005
Sorry, new job. Dog walker.

397
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:21,725
Gay.

398
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,165
Quiet, Madam.

399
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:28,725
Be quiet, Madam.

400
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,405
Um...

401
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:34,445
She's not my dog. She's my mum's.

402
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,005
Yeah, she's cute.

403
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,325
She's a champ. Okay?

404
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:42,445
She’s like the Kim Kardashian
of tiny dogs.

405
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,045
Oh.

406
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:47,885
Up, Madam.

407
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,245
Up! Show me tits.

408
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:52,525
- Good girl. Oh! Good girl.
- Hey!

409
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,325
That is wicked.

410
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,165
Hey, Madam sounds a bit like Adam.

411
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,685
What are you trying to say?

412
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:03,525
Nothing. Nothing. Okay, bye. Bye, um...

413
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,085
- Madam! Madam!
- Um...

414
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:13,285
I'm so sorry.

415
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,685
Uh, I've gotta drop these off,
but I can come back...

416
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:18,765
Don't bother, okay? You shouldn’t be
walkin' dogs if you can’t control them.

417
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:20,845
Just fuck off.

418
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,925

Hello.

452
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,365
Hi.

453
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:33,725
Okay, then.

454
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,125
I heard a thing.

455
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:42,205
- Okay.
<i>- </i>This thing concerns your virginal status.

456
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,205
Excuse me?

457
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:48,365
I heard on the grapevine
that your cherry remains unpopped.

458
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,205
- That's none of your business.
- Yeah, let’s skip the faux modesty.

459
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:53,405
- I'm down if you are.
- Down?

460
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,725
Deflowering the maiden.

461
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:59,245
Breaking the lawn chair,
skinning the fish.

462
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:03,165
- Your dick in my vagina. What do you say?
- Yeah, um...

463
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:05,965
Wait, sorry, who are you?

464
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,005
Whoever you want me to be.

465
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:11,485
Also, I'm Lily.

466
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:15,765
Well, thanks, Lily, but, um...

467
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,005
I'm gonna have to politely decline.

468
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:19,325
Okay.

469
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:21,565
Well, if you change your mind,

470
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:23,925
you can usually find me in music room B.

471
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:25,725
Or algebra club.

472
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:28,085
Bye, then.

473
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:29,605
Bye.

474
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:34,765
Woof-woof-woof! O-Dawg!

475
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:36,885
Uh... J... Dude.

476
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,765
Just wanna say thanks for the help, man.

477
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,485
Me and Maeve have been texting all night.

478
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:42,205
- She's, like, mad brainy.
- Yeah. I know.

479
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:44,285
I'm actually into
some of this stuff too, you know.

480
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,005
- It is good to look outside your bubble.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

481
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,181
- It's all thanks to you, man.
- You know what, Jackson?

482
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:50,125
- I...
- Ah, that's her!

483
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,541
- I didn't...
- Gotta go. Thank you.

484
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:52,405
- Wait.
- Yeah?

485
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:54,045
Okay.

486
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:56,485
Yo!

487
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:09,845
It's for you.

488
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,805
It's soup, for a sick person.

489
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,005
Oh, no! Oh, you shouldn't have done that.

490
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:18,245
I'm feeling so much better today.
Just a scratchy throat.

491
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:21,005
Still, uh... eat the soup.
It's good for you.

492
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,045
No one's ever made me soup before.

493
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,165
It's just soup.

494
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,205
Okay, back to work, then.

495
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:30,965
Excuse me.

496
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:33,565
Excuse me.

497
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:55,605
Mm!

498
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,405
Why don't you just go out with him?

499
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:40,085
Let's do a mind map.

500
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,405
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just writing stuff down.

501
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:45,165
But in a fun way that engages
all sides of your brain.

502
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:46,725
You mean both sides.

503
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:47,885
Yeah, all of them.

504
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:49,445
It's really good for hard decisions

505
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,725
like, should I get a fringe,

506
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,205
even though Mum says
it'll make my face look chubby?

507
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:56,245
Or should I tell Mum I hate her
and run away from home?

508
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,365
Hm?

509
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,645
So, let's start with Jackson's nice bits.

510
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,685
Okay. Um...

511
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,485
He's good at sex.

512
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:07,405
Like, properly good.

513
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:08,805
Mm!

514
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:11,925
- Uh, he's attractive.
<i>- </i>And he's popular.

515
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:14,325
Mm-hm. And he's going places.

516
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,365
Like, he's not a slacker.

517
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,565
No, he's probably gonna be president
or something.

518
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,205
We don't have presidents
in this country, Aimee.

519
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:25,045
Okay, what else?

520
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:29,085
Do you have things in common?

521
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:30,445
Yeah, we do.

522
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:31,965
- Weirdly.
- So...

523
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:33,885
Cons?

524
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:36,845
- I don't want a boyfriend.
- I don't get it.

525
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:39,685
Having a boyfriend is the best thing.

526
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,165
What’s so good about it?

527
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:46,125
You always have someone to hang out with.

528
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:49,845
And, like, last week, I got chased
by a fox, and Kyle threw a shoe at it.

529
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:52,685
It was so romantic.

530
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:07,605
This is good. It's really helpful,
being in the water, isn't it?

531
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:11,565
It's freeing us up. We're really figuring
out how our bodies can intertwine.

532
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:14,205
It’s working well for me.
Is it working for you?

533
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:15,965
No.

534
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:22,405
How's it going, guys?

535
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:24,485
What are you doing?

536
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,621
I don't want you to think
I engineered this situation

537
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:27,925
for my own sexual gratification.

538
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:29,325
That would be super creepy.

539
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,085
Hence the backwards stance.

540
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:34,045
This is even creepier.
Just turn around. Stop being creepy.

541
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:40,645
Well, like I said before, I am
a sex and relationship therapist.

542
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:43,245
You are a teenager with
an inflated sense of self-importance.

543
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:44,645
Right. Well, I have a hunch

544
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:48,165
that this is more to do with your
relationship than your physical intimacy.

545
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:50,581
- How's your communication?
- We've known each other

546
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,965
since primary school,
and we talk for hours.

547
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:55,445
- It might help.
- Interesting.

548
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,365
How long have you guys been together?

549
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,445
About four months.

550
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:01,605
We both came out around the same time
and it just happened.

551
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:02,525
Interesting.

552
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:04,365
I'm sure you find
lots of things interesting,

553
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,645
but our problem is with the sex,
not the relationship.

554
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,645
So we're just gonna
figure this out on our own.

555
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:10,965
Uh...

556
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:14,085
Well, come back when you're ready
to talk about your relationship.

557
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:16,965
Good session, team. Great progress.

558
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,485
How's it going with Jackson?

559
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:36,325
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

560
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,165
You guys seem to be spending
a lot of time together.

561
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:40,965
What do you care?

562
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:43,285
I was just asking. Sorry.

563
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,445
He does seem keen for us
to hang out more, but...

564
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:50,125
I don't really get it.

565
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:52,165
Like, we have loads of sex.

566
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,645
So why'd he wanna complicate things?

567
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:58,205
It's stupid.
Anyway, I don't do boyfriends.

568
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:01,685
Why not?

569
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:06,925
You know in rom-coms, when the guy finally
realizes he’s in love with the girl,

570
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,245
and he turns up
with a boom box outside her house,

571
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:12,325
blasting her favorite song,
and everyone in the audience swoons?

572
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:14,645
Yeah, that makes me sick.

573
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,365
Okay, but seriously,

574
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:20,325
what's wrong with boyfriends?

575
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,925
It’s just someone else
to let you down, isn't it?

576
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,325
You really think so?

577
00:30:36,765 --> 00:30:37,765
What the hell?

578
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:39,725
What?

579
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,125
Ah!

580
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,525
Like that, do you?

581
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:48,925
Don't fucking...

582
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:59,525
So... why don't you wanna
go out with Jackson?

583
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:01,405
- I mean, really.
- No.

584
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,045
We don't do that therapy thing.

585
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,965
Save that for the clientele.

586
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:09,645
Fine.

587
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:11,765
I'm me and he's him.

588
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:13,325
Meaning?

589
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:17,085
Come on, Otis, he's Jackson and I'm...
You know.

590
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:18,245
Maeve.

591
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:21,485
No, I'm a grotty, stinky cock-biter
who lives in a caravan.

592
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:23,445
Come on! You're not. Look...

593
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:24,805
You're not that stinky.

594
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,685
Plus, I thought it was a scrote you bit?

595
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:29,125
Dickhead!

596
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:30,205
Oh!

597
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:39,725
You look like the Cookie Monster.

598
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,005
Wait...

599
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:45,365
Ooh! Okay.

600
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,645
Ow! Yeah, let's go.

601
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,365
- Okay.
- Yeah.

602
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,085
You coming?

603
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:53,605
No.

604
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,125
- What? You just said we better go.
- I'm staying here.

605
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:57,565
Why?

606
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,125
Um...

607
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:00,805
Exercise.

608
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:02,805
Yeah, but school is closing.

609
00:32:03,565 --> 00:32:04,565
Yeah, but...

610
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:06,885
exercise.

611
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:08,805
Okay.

612
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,205
You're compellingly odd, Milburn.

613
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:24,925
Fucking go away.

614
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,805
Must have been
one hell of a blow job, Wiley.

615
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,085
Otis.

616
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:39,565
Uh...

617
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:44,445
Promise not to laugh.

618
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:48,565
I might have a mild to moderate crush
on Maeve.

619
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:50,725
Yeah, no shit. What gave it away?

620
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,125
She, uh...

621
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,845
She touched my eyebrows
and now I have an erection.

622
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,365
You said you wouldn't laugh.

623
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,205
Ugh. It won't go away.

624
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,285
It's been half an hour,

625
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:07,925
and it's really cold.

626
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,085
There's only one solution.

627
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,565
Okay.

628
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:17,725
It's just wanking.

629
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:22,765
Oh, God.

630
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:32,845

AC/DC! AC/DC! Okay.

640
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:58,445
Adam and the Ants,
Aerosmith, Alice in Chains.

641
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,725
The Blues Brothers. Bowie, David.

642
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,925
The Byrds. Okay.

643
00:34:04,805 --> 00:34:06,165
- Did you do it?
- No.

644
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,565
I alphabetized my music collection
and it went away.

645
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:09,885
It's okay, man.

646
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,725
- Next time.
- We won't speak of this ever again, okay?

647
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:15,565
Otis!

648
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,525
You got a minute?

649
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:20,725
Yeah.

650
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,485
I know the drill.

651
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:27,085
Bye, Jackson.

652
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,205
So I'm gonna ask Maeve out,
properly this time.

653
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,205
- How do you think I should do it?
- Jackson...

654
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:37,845
you're a smart guy.
I'm sure you can figure it out.

655
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,885
But I need your help.
Everything you said worked.

656
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:42,725
- I don't want to screw this up.
- I'm all out of advice, sorry.

657
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:45,965
Come on, man. Look, we talk, we laugh.
We have crazy good sex.

658
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:47,805
Now I just wanna seal the deal.

659
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:50,725
Well...

660
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:52,885
what do you usually do?

661
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:57,685
Well, usually I say, "Do you wanna
go out?" And then they say yes.

662
00:34:58,485 --> 00:34:59,485
It's that easy?

663
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,965
Well, it's just not usually this hard.

664
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:03,245
Okay, do you even like Maeve?

665
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:05,205
Or have you just never
not got your way before?

666
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:06,285
No, I like her.

667
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,885
I wake up and I'm thinkin' about her.

668
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:10,605
I go to sleep and I'm thinkin' about her.

669
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,805
It's driving me insane.

670
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,485
I think she could be the...

671
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,405
the one.

672
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:19,205
Wait, sorry.

673
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,325
Sorry. You're right.
I'll figure this out on my own.

674
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:23,365
- You've helped out enough.
- Yeah.

675
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:27,765
You know, it's weird.
You're my age, but wise.

676
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:29,725
You're like my mum...

677
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,365
in a little man’s body.

678
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:33,645
Like a little mum man.

679
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:34,725
No offense.

680
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,125
Make a grand gesture.

681
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,245
What, like flowers?

682
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:45,885
Grander.

683
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:47,805
Like a giant teddy bear?

684
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,005
Much grander.

685
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:51,485
Think, like...
like rom-com grand, you know?

686
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,165
Public, passionate.

687
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,605
Heart on your sleeve,
running through the rain...

688
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:57,805
If it seems too much, go bigger.

689
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,605
- If you want her...
- Yeah.

690
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:00,965
...show her how much.

691
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:02,685
Trust me.

692
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:04,605
All right. Thanks, man.

693
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:07,445
You really are a good guy.

694
00:36:15,285 --> 00:36:18,165
You are stone cold evil.

695
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:20,205
Look, you told me to screw over Jackson.

696
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:21,645
All right? This was your idea.

697
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:23,965
I say lots of stuff.
You're not supposed to listen to me.

698
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,165
- This is bad. You're a bad person.
- Stop saying that.

699
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:28,605
Why are you now suddenly bad?

700
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:31,685
Because I'm in love with Maeve, all right?
There, I admit it. Are you happy?

701
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:34,445
Well, not really.
I think I prefer Cupcake Otis.

702
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,725
I need to stop Jackson.

703
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:37,885
Uh, then he'll know
that you're in love with Maeve.

704
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,965
Then I need to warn Maeve
about what he's gonna do.

705
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:43,045
Then she'll know that you took money
from Jackson and gave him bad advice

706
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:46,045
- because you're in love with her.
- All my options are dog shit.

707
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:47,485
Yep.

708
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,165
I'm going home.

709
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,125
Okay.

710
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,925
Well, have a nice night, bad man.

711
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,205
Thank you for all your work.

712
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,525
And for the soup.

713
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:03,205
It was very good.

714
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:05,565
I, uh... washed it.

715
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:08,005
I told you, it's the best soup.

716
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:15,285
- Oh. It's okay.
- Clumsy man.

717
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:16,605
I...

718
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:20,245
Thank you.

719
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,485
You are a strange woman.

720
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:35,765
Goodbye, then.

721
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:38,165
Just put those in there.

722
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:41,165
Thank you. Goodbye, Jean.

723
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:44,405
Bye, Mr. Builder.

724
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:58,045
- Hello.
- Uh...

725
00:37:58,805 --> 00:37:59,965
Finish your research?

726
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,085
My... Yes.

727
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:04,645
Oh, my God. Yes, I did.

728
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:07,285
It was actual research, by the way.

729
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:08,885
It's... It's hard to explain.

730
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:11,045
But, um, I needed
to know about scissoring.

731
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:14,165
Okay. I'm Ola.

732
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,165
I'm Otis.

733
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:18,445
I got something for you.
To help with your research.

734
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:19,645
My dad installed it.

735
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,085
You know we’re already recording it.

736
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:27,045
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

737
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:28,885
- Hey.
- See ya.

738
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:30,405

00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:09,285
No one.

763
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:11,325
Well, um...

764
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:14,125
Ruthie, but I'm not perving,
I'm just watching.

765
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:16,005
Never mind.

766
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,365
Shame the scissoring thing didn't work.

767
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,645
I'm so skint right now.

768
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:25,765
Uh...

769
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,445
- What's that?
- It's your cut. I treated someone.

770
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:34,565
You're a fucking gem, Otis.

771
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:45,885
Tromboner.

772
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:48,045
Hey, Adam.

773
00:40:48,765 --> 00:40:49,885
Did you find Madam?

774
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,045
Can you smell...

775
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:55,445
dog shit?

776
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,965
Wiley, can I speak to you for a second?

777
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:03,285
No chemically induced hard-on today?

778
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:05,845
You're so funny,
you make my dick hurt. Listen...

779
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:08,605
Uh, that essay thing Sands
was banging on about. Write it for me.

780
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:11,165
- I can pay.
- The hand-in's tomorrow. Sorry.

781
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:12,685
Shit, I really need this.

782
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,165
Come on, I can pay double.

783
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,125
Triple.

784
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,125
Okay.

785
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:23,725
Great.

786
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:30,725
What did you buy
from the supermarket today?

787
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:33,925
Only you could make French unsexy.

788
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:39,845
You do not want to kiss
your girlfriend anymore.

789
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:41,765
Hm?

790
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:45,885
You like someone else.

791
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:50,325
Look, Tanya is my best friend.

792
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:54,405
She was really supportive of me
when I came out and everything.

793
00:41:56,125 --> 00:42:00,005
- So when she came out too, I thought...
- You might as well be in a relationship.

794
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:03,165
We're so close, I thought it would be
the perfect relationship,

795
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,685
but when we have sex...

796
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,965
it just feels wrong.

797
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:10,165
And when I'm doing it with Jessa...

798
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:13,445
everything just works.

799
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:18,085
I don't know what to do.

800
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,565
You have to tell Tanya the truth.

801
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:24,805
It would kill her.

802
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:30,045
You can't choose who you're attracted to.

803
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:32,805
You can't...

804
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,925
You can't engineer a relationship.

805
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:39,805
You have to do what's right.

806
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,485
I still think it’s weird
a teenage boy is a sex therapist.

807
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:46,245
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

808
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,805
<i>This is an urgent announcement
from your Head Boy.</i>

809
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:54,005
<i>Will all sixth formers please head
to the canteen now?</i>

810
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:09,925
Has anyone seen Jackson?

811
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,765
Uh... Maybe it’s a fire drill?

812
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,485
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

813
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:18,205
- Maeve!
- Look. He's gonna make a speech.

814
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:20,365
Yes, Moordale!
Sorry for the interruption,

815
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:22,325
but, hey, it's just your education, right?

816
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:26,261
There's somebody in this crowd
who is very special to me.

817
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:27,965
And no, it's not you, Mr. Groff.

818
00:43:30,445 --> 00:43:31,965
This person is pretty damn incredible.

819
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:34,445
She's one of a kind.

820
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:37,365
But I was an idiot
because I wanted to hide how I felt.

821
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,965
Well, I'm not gonna
keep it secret anymore.

822
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,525
Maeve Wiley...

823
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:46,485
this is for you.

824
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:49,765
I think he's gonna...

825
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:52,405
...sing.

826
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:54,605
