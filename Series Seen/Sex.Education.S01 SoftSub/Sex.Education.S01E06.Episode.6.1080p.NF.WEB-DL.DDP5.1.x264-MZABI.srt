1
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,845
I can't stop thinking about...

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,125
What?

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,205
You.

4
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:16,325
In a sexual way.

5
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:19,805
Yeah, it's what we call, erm...

6
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,805
transference, it's, er...

7
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,525
It's quite common.

8
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,085
Something we can work through...

9
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,125
together.

10
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,645
I'd like to work through it.

11
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:38,045
Hm.

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,325
I'd also like to have sex.

13
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:41,085
Oh.

14
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:42,525
Right now.

15
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:45,165
Hm.

16
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:00,405
Sh, sh, sh!

17
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:02,485
Shhh.

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,245
"There was once a very happy
horse called Hubert.

19
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:13,165
Hubert was so happy,
he would run around all day long..."

20
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:14,645
- Mummy.
- Mm?

21
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:17,165
Why was Daddy naked with that lady?

22
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,645
What do you mean, darling?

23
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:23,765
Daddy was naked
with that lady in his office.

24
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,125
I saw their bums.

25
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,125
Do you know what sex is, Otis?

26
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:45,485
Sex is when a man puts his penis
inside a woman's vagina.

27
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:47,165
Does it hurt?

28
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:48,685
It can.

29
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:53,285
Intercourse can... be wonderful,

30
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,965
but it can also cause tremendous pain.

31
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:59,485
And if you're not careful...

32
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:02,845
sex can destroy lives.

33
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:11,165
"Happy Hubert was going
to the happy horse festival,

34
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,525
to see all his happy horse friends..."

You look...

47
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:13,365
- Normal.
- I was going to say "nice".

48
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,285
Your bruise is healing.

Everyone stop staring.

51
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:24,565
Let's eat.

52
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:29,805
Dear Father God,

53
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,925
thank You for waking us all
up in the morning.

54
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,685
I'm very thankful for this food.
In Jesus' name, amen.

55
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:36,765
- Amen.
- Amen.

56
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,045
<i>Ah, phew... Busy, busy, busy.</i>

57
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,125
<i>Yet another TED talk to do tomorrow,</i>

58
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,885
<i>and then straight back on
to the book tour.</i>

59
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:48,565
<i>First stop, Las Vegas.
And that is one crazy town!</i>

60
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,205
<i>How are you doin', dude?</i>

61
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:56,645
I’m good. Yeah, I'm really good. Great.

62
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:57,965
Just...

63
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:01,805
<i>Overcompensation merely masks
an unconscious weakness, Otis.</i>

64
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,965
<i>Now, come on, talk to your old man.</i>

65
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,285
I, er...

66
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,845
I had a fight
with one of my best mates.

67
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:16,845
He said some stuff...

68
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,685
We both said some stuff, and...

69
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:25,125
Actually... No, it's all right.
I'm fine. It's fine.

70
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:26,485
<i>Oh, come on, pal.</i>

71
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,445
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

72
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:33,765
How old were you
when you lost your virginity?

73
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,365
<i>Ah... Uh...</i>

74
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:39,605
<i>Two days after my 15th birthday,
to be exact.</i>

75
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:44,125
<i>So, you're still a virgin.
Well, that... That's cool, kid.</i>

76
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:46,085
<i>There's nothing wrong with that.</i>

77
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:48,005
Yeah, but I'm... I...

78
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:49,765
I'm...

79
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,445
I can't even just...

80
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:56,685
I’m behind. I'm way behind my peers.

81
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:58,485
<i>Listen. The first time you do it,</i>

82
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,245
<i>it will probably be bad.</i>

83
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,365
<i>The good stuff comes later.</i>

84
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:04,965
<i>So you have to ask yourself,
"Why am I waiting?"</i>

85
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,565
<i>It's kind of like skydiving, you know.</i>

86
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,845
<i>Yes.
At some point, you've just gotta...</i>

87
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,885
<i>Whoo! Chuck yourself out of the plane.</i>

88
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,885
So, I should just jump?

89
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,605
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

90
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,485
<i>Just rip that Band-Aid right off.</i>

91
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:27,045
How’s your father?

92
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:28,285
He's fine.

93
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:30,405
Did you talk to him
about your fight with Eric?

94
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,365
I think it's important

95
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:33,405
- you don't bottle up residual guilt.
- Mum!

96
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:35,965
What did you talk about?

97
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,645
Father-son stuff.

98
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:06,205
<i>Yeah, keep going, Jackson!
Come on, man!</i>

99
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,325
Let's go!

100
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,725
Pain is temporary, eh?

101
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,925
Greatness is forever, Jackson!

102
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,365
No, man!

103
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,285
You're miles off! Huh?

104
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:19,885
You're coming up out of the water
straight into the stroke, man.

105
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:22,365
You're losing all your technique.

106
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:25,365
How many times have we gotta go
through this, Jackson?

107
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:30,365
Right, listen.
Don't take your eye off the ball.

108
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:31,685
You need to focus.

109
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,325
I am focused.

110
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,605
Look. You've got your whole life
for girlfriends, Jacko.

111
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:46,965
You've got county trials coming up.
And then you're on to the nationals.

112
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,605
Remember, winners never quit.

113
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,845
- Quitters never win.
- Aye. Let's go again.

114
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,325
What's happened, Tromboner?
Yeah? Woken up straight?

115
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:27,605
Well, you look shit.

116
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:32,325
So I think I need to talk to Otis.

117
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:35,245
- Problems with Kyle?
- Oh, no, I'm with Steve now.

118
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,205
Who’s Steve?

119
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,765
You know, Top-Heavy Steve?

120
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,165
- Hm?
- Built like a Chupa Chup.

121
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,725
Cool. Yeah. I'll book you in.

122
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,445
You're in the library first period, right?

123
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,565
Great. You can take these back for me.

124
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:53,365
Oh, and by the way,
I have some late fines.

125
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,165
I'd like to be helpful.

126
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:02,285
Give me some.

127
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:04,565
Come on.

128
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,925
- Hi, Maeve.
- Hi.

129
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,285
- How are you?
- Great. Yeah.

130
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,365
- Great.
- Cool.

131
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:33,205
Hey!

132
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,845
- Watch where you're goin'.
- Sorry.

133
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:45,805
Trouble in paradise?

134
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:47,925
He won't talk to me.

135
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,565
Er, good morning, Moordale.

136
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:55,325
Er, let's start today's assembly
with a very special announcement.

137
00:08:55,645 --> 00:09:01,525
Er, the winner of this year's sixth form
essay competition has been decided.

138
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,085
So, the, er...

139
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:06,125
award goes to...

140
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,445
Er, Adam Groff.

141
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:16,685
Erm... Er...

142
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,365
Well, le... let's, er...

143
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:23,125
Let's give Adam a round of applause
as we welcome him on stage

144
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,525
to, er, read out...

145
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,405
the winning entry.

146
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,165
L... Er, Langston...

147
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:52,685
"Langston Hughes
wrote a poem called 'Dreams.'

148
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,245
He said, 'Hold fast to dreams,

149
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:58,205
for, if dreams die,

150
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,085
life is but a broken-winged bird,

151
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:01,485
that cannot fly.'

152
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,205
Er, Joseph Conman.

153
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,245
- Con...
- Conrad.

154
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,325
Conrad.

155
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,605
Joseph Conrad was right.

156
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,445
We live as we dream.

157
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:13,965
Alone.

158
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,925
Er... In ten years' time...

159
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:21,045
I hope I have my arms and my hands..."

160
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,765
Oh, by the way, can you meet Aimee
in the, erm, science lab after lunch?

161
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,565
She's having bedroom problems with Steve.

162
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,045
Who's Steve?

163
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:31,165
Top-Heavy Steve?
Looks like an ice-cream cone.

164
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:33,965
- Yes! Okay. Science lab.
- Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:35,485
- I'll be there.
- Cool.

166
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:37,285
Oh, erm...

167
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,165
Maybe don't mention that you're a virgin.

168
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,645
Like, obviously, it's totally cool.
Not that big of a deal.

169
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,085
However, could be really bad
for business.

170
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:49,405
- Sure. Yeah, I won't tell anyone.
- Nice.

171
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:50,525
- See you later.
- See ya.

172
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,925
Would you like to have sex with me?

173
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,045
It's a no-strings-attached
kind of situation.

174
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:58,605
I only want one thing.

175
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,085
- Your dick.
- I've got a girlfriend. Sorry.

176
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:07,925
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

177
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:09,285
What is it with boys?

178
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,325
It's like you all suddenly
woke up with boundaries.

179
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,845
I’ve been thinking about your...

180
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:15,565
proposition.

181
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,205
- If you're still interested...
- Yes.

182
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,885
Great! Fantastic.

183
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:22,301
To be clear, I don't want
to have sex with you specifically.

184
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,405
- Just a human man with a penis.
- That's...

185
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,365
great for my self-esteem.

186
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:28,045
I feel the same way.

187
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:30,365
Purely... pragmatic.

188
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,405
- Do you wanna meet up this week?
- Tonight.

189
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:34,925
Your house. I'll bring the condoms.

190
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,125
- You bring the lube.
- No...

191
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:53,405
Hi.

192
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,445
Hello.

193
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,685
I'm here to put in new taps.

194
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:57,765
Yes.

195
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,565
- In case you forgot.
- No.

196
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,725
No, I didn't forget.

197
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,525
Okay.

198
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:05,885
So...

199
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:09,005
- The bathroom.
- Yeah.

200
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,085
Yeah.

201
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,845
Could you... possibly take a look
at something else first?

202
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:37,045
Your son is very angry.

203
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:40,445
- No?
- Well, actually,

204
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,885
- he's usually quite contained.
- Okay.

205
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,925
I have two teenage daughters.

206
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:49,045
They used to be angels.

207
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,485
And now they are evil.

208
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,845
Like demons from Hell.

209
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:59,245
I... I love my girls. Hm?

210
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,085
I do, but I don't like them very much.

211
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,405
Yes, well...

212
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:07,005
middle adolescence is a tumultuous stage
of development.

213
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,765
So, you dislike your son too?

214
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:14,125
Oh, well, that's a very strong word
to use about one's child.

215
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:19,205
Do you always avoid questions like this?

216
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,365
No. Of course not.

217
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,005
Okay.

218
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,645
Okay. Erm...

219
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,125
Sometimes, I do dislike my son.

220
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,965
I mean, yes, he used to be sweet

221
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,685
and really loving, and...

222
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:37,205
now he doesn't share anything with me.

223
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:42,085
I mean, I understand
that it's a natural stage of puberty,

224
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,965
the desire for autonomy,

225
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,885
but I guess I wasn't expecting it
to hurt quite so much.

226
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:52,285
Hm. But we can never let them know
how much they make us feel lonely.

227
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,685
Wardrobe is fucked.
Now I'll fix your bathroom.

228
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:01,965
So, Aimee,

229
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:03,885
what seems to be the problem?

230
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,685
So, me and Steve are having sex,

231
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:09,885
and everything's
completely normal, until...

232
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:13,405
Mm.

233
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,285
Mm.

234
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,005
Do you wanna come on my face?

235
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,205
Not really.

236
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:20,565
Why?

237
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,125
I, er... I like your face.

238
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:24,565
Mm. Mm!

239
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,685
What about my tits, then?

240
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,765
- Hm...
- Do you wanna come on them?

241
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:30,165
I'm sorry, can... can we stop?

242
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,845
- Have I done something wrong?
- No.

243
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:34,725
It's just... Do you actually want me
to do any of that stuff?

244
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:35,805
Yeah.

245
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:37,885
I think so.

246
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,205
It feels like you're performing.

247
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,245
Tell me what you want.

248
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,005
I don't know what I want.

249
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,885
No one's ever asked me that before.

250
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:52,085
Steve says his "thing" is
girls properly enjoying sex.

251
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,205
He says he can tell I'm being fake.

252
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,605
- Well, are you?
- Yeah. I'm always fake.

253
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,845
Well, you should probably think about...

254
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:04,605
you know, things you enjoy
when it's just you.

255
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:06,365
Alone.

256
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:08,485
Ugh! I don't do that.

257
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:11,205
- Yuck!
- Er, you don't...

258
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:15,525
- Really?
- No. I always have a boyfriend.

259
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:17,085
Well...

260
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:21,365
women do tend to feel more shame
surrounding masturbation than men.

261
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:25,685
Feeling that it's...
it's sort of taboo, or dirty.

262
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:28,765
Which it isn’t.

263
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:32,565
And of course, some men also...

264
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,365
feel this way about areas.

265
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:38,205
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Nothing, I'm just...

266
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,125
What I'm saying is...

267
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:44,445
before you talk to Steve, you...
you should probably figure out...

268
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,685
you know, what works for you...

269
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:48,805
and your body.

270
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,645
So you're prescribing a wank?

271
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,165
Yeah.

272
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,205
Er... ah... Okay! Okay! Okay.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

273
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:08,845
Ah! Mm!

274
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,405
Mm! Who is the rogue metronome?

275
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,845
Huh?

276
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:15,605
No culprits then, right?

277
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,965
Okay, I see.
You got away with it this time,

278
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:22,245
but I am watching you with my ears.

279
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,525
That's impossible, by the way.

280
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:27,085
Let's try again. One, two, three, and...

281
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:33,525
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Stop.

282
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:35,485
Stop. What’s going on, guys?

283
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,245
- Talk to me.
- It's Tromboner.

284
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:39,205
He's bad.

285
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:43,445
That's harsh, Neville. Okay?
Eric needs our support.

286
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:47,325
You are jazz, Eric is jazz, I am jazz.

287
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,805
Okay?

288
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,685
E-Man. What's up today?

289
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,325
Sir, he's wasting everybody's time.

290
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,725
- Okay...
- No, I'll go, then.

291
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,445
Hey, it’s chill, E-Man.

292
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,045
My name is Eric!

293
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:04,565
Stop trying to be cool.

294
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:08,365
You're an alcoholic music teacher
who thinks that he "gets jazz".

295
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,445
You're tragic.

296
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:12,245
I don't appreciate that tone.

297
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,245
- Eric, come back here...
- Don't fucking touch me!

298
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:39,245
What happened to Tromboner?

299
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,325
I think he's going for that prison chic.

300
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,045
Eric...

301
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,405
<i>Eric Effiong to Mr. Groff's office.</i>

302
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,525
<i>Eric Effiong to Mr. Groff's office.</i>

303
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,125
What'd you think of Adam's essay?

304
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:32,461
I wasn't paying attention, to be honest.
I was just thinking about...

305
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:33,805
- The counties.
- Yeah.

306
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:37,965
Speaking of that...

307
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,645
I really need to focus
for the next few weeks,

308
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:43,565
so I might not be able to, like...
hang out as much.

309
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,125
Sorry for being boring.

310
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,885
We're not married, Jackson. It's fine.

311
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:01,885
Be right back.

312
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:10,085
Hey, frog face. Did you miss me?

313
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,685
Ooh! Whoa! Okay, I'll probably just...

314
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,581
- Okay...
- Why are you bothering my girlfriend?

315
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,285
- Girlfriend?
- Stop it. Stop it!

316
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:17,325
Sorry, who's the dickhead?

317
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:18,925
- My brother.
- What?

318
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:21,845
Oh... Sis, did you not tell
Action Man about me?

319
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:24,165
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Houston. Texas.

320
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,805
Training to be an astronaut.

321
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,165
I've lost my keys.

322
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,085
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- You do now.

323
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:59,405
Suspended.

324
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,405
And detention for the rest of the term.

325
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,445
What were you thinking?

326
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,285
At least I'm not expelled.

327
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,845
That's not the point.

328
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,005
Did someone try and hurt you?

329
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:28,725
Just sick of...

330
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,485
everyone treatin' me like shit.

331
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,525
It's how we all feel.

332
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,485
But you can't go around punching people.

333
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,405
- You told me to toughen up.
- But not like that.

334
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,805
What kind of man do you want to be?

335
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:04,125
What kind of man
do you want me to be, Dad?

336
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:20,565
I, er...

337
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,925
I know you wrote Adam's essay.

338
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:25,965
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

339
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,365
Go tell Groff if you're so sure.

340
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:32,085
Oh, and get you expelled? I don't think
that's what you want, is it?

341
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:33,245
Look.

342
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:37,165
Lots of people
have acquired knowledge, Maeve.

343
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,005
Not many people have ideas.

344
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:40,525
You're an original thinker.

345
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,405
I don't need the inspirational speech,
thanks.

346
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:45,125
I want you to think about applying
for the Moordale Aptitude Scheme.

347
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,845
It could help you get
a university scholarship.

348
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,285
Just think about it and let me know.

349
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,725
Right...

350
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:21,365
Let's do this.

351
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,565
Do you, erm...
Do you... like manga?

352
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,445
Sorry.

353
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:41,485
Erm... That was... I need a safe word.

354
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:42,925
Flamin... flamingo.

355
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:46,485
I'm not very experienced.

356
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,965
- I'm sorry.
- Me either.

357
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,445
That's the whole point.

358
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:51,605
I know. I know, it's just I...

359
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:53,805
I'm gonna need

360
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:56,605
to take things slow.

361
00:22:58,165 --> 00:22:59,165
Yeah.

362
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,365
Do you have any music?

363
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,765
To set the mood.

364
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:11,925
Er...

365
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,285
Ooh. Erm...

366
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,845
Er...

367
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:19,125
Whale ambience helps me sleep.

368
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:31,765
Did you know
that whales only have sex for 35 seconds?

369
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,405
Which is odd,

370
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:37,405
actually, because their penises
are seven feet long.

371
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,565
I reckon you could drown in their come.

372
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,765
Fascinating.

373
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:47,245
So, exactly how slow are we talkin'?
‘Cause I’m good to go.

374
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,685
Surprise!

375
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,205
You clever boy.

376
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,645
It's all right, love.

377
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,245
We wanted to celebrate.

378
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,205
I'm so proud of you.

379
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:25,645
Thanks, Mum.

380
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:28,765
Aren’t we so proud?

381
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,805
- Oh, yes. Yes!
- Proud of Adam, yes!

382
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,725
Erm... Ye... Yes, already said.

383
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,045
We're very proud.

384
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,405
Hi, Jeffrey.

385
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,365
I'll get the rent to you
by the end of the week.

386
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:58,645
It's all right, Miss Maeve.
Your brother's already paid.

387
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,005
Funny lad.

388
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:09,965
Ah, toss.

389
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:12,885
Looking for my wedding ring.

390
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,085
- Cynthia and I had another fight.
- Oh.

391
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,685
I got a tattoo, I thought she'd like it.

392
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,365
- I mean, it's nice, right?
- Erm...

393
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:24,765
Yeah. Yeah, it's uncanny.

394
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:28,245
Hm. Bye, Jeffrey.

395
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,325
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Is this supposed to make up for the fact
you left without saying goodbye?

403
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:49,165
- Pancakes with chocolate chips.
- I woke up and you were gone.

404
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:51,805
Chocolate chips,
which I shall arrange into smiley faces

405

- You disappeared for four months, Sean!

406
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:57,365
- I was really fucking worried.
- Look, I know I'm a bastard, all right?

407
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:58,965
I got into some trouble.

408
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:00,765
I was selling this guy's merchandise.

409
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:02,365
- I knew it.
- No, no, no, not drugs!

410
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,525
I don't do that do that shit anymore.

411
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:08,605
Long story short, it was about
a grand's worth of rip-off Nikes,

412
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:11,045
combined with a very ill-informed
drunken night out,

413
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,045
resulting in a lot of lost goods

414
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,845
and a very angry
and actually quite aggressive supplier.

415
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:19,685
Basically, I had to disappear.

416
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,485
And... I'm so sorry.

417
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:22,645
Yeah, you always are.

418
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:31,845
Why are you back? Do you need money?

419
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,605
Do you know what? I... I'm just gonna go.

420
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:38,085
- This is ridiculous.
- Go. Where are you gonna go? Texas?

421
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:41,445
They have space training
in Russia as well, you know, Maeve?

422
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,125
I mean, it is a shame about the weather,

423
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,725
and the human rights issues, but...

424
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,165
actually, very good rockets.

425
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:54,325
Those pancakes better have
whipped cream on them.

426
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,645
What do you take me for?

427
00:26:57,045 --> 00:26:58,045
An amateur?

428
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,325
Ah!

429
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:55,845
Hmm!

430
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:57,845
I want a crumpet.

431
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,245
Oh! Eww...

432
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:07,365
Okay, this is too slow.

433
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,565
Look, I just...

434
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:14,205
I think we can work up
to the more intimate stuff.

435
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,805
We've been holding hands for 45 minutes.

436
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:20,045
I know how to hold hands.
I'm here to fornicate.

437
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,485
Let's try something new?

438
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:23,925
I could suck your balls.

439
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:28,605
I was thinking more like a soft hug.

440
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:29,925
What's a soft hug?

441
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,285
You know, just...

442
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,205
Mm. Soft.

443
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,325
Why don't I wank you off?
You could go down on me.

444
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,725
- I can't do that.
- Do you wanna do this or not?

445
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:42,485
Bye, then.

446
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:45,365
Wait!

447
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:55,405
You're quite sexy.

448
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:08,445
You're sexy too.

449
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:09,925
I know.

450
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:14,445
Squeeze my nipples.

451
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:16,725
Like that?

452
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,205
That... Wow.

- Yes, yes, I would.

465
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:39,125
Sorry. You have... just...
a piece of fluff.

466
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,925
Are you gonna sniff my head again?

467
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,965
No! No, erm...

468
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:46,405
- Yes, no, just... a piece of fluff.
- Yeah, yeah, I see.

469
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,485
- Thank you for removing this...
- Oh...

470
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:50,405
fluff.

471
00:30:56,445 --> 00:31:01,085
Look, we are obviously physically
attracted to one another.

472
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,245
I mean, that comes...

473
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,445
down to compatible pheromones.

474
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,565
- Is it?
- Yes.

475
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:09,485
I mean, only about ten percent of men

476
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:12,725
have high enough quantities
of androsterone, which is the...

477
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,685
pheromone that gives humans
what we call sex appeal.

478
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,125
I mean, these...

479
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:24,205
These men don't even need
to be remotely attractive.

480
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:26,165
- But the pheromones...
- Yes, just...

481
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:31,405
send off powerful signals of...

482
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:34,285
attraction.

You can't help yourself, can you?

497
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:26,445
- You...
- Why are you always so dramatic, Jean?

498
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:31,285
- You put your cock in her!
- No, you're behaving like a crazy woman!

499
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,925
You make me into a crazy woman!

500
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:37,341
Look, I... I cannot be around you
when you're like this.

501
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:39,285
- Remi, don't... You...
- No, I'm going out!

502
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:43,045
Otis? Sweetheart?

503
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,685
Why are you staring at me?

504
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,245
Ah, you gave us quite a fright, darling.

505
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:50,685
What happened, exactly?

506
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,925
We were trying to have sex,
but I think it was a bit much for him.

507
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:56,085
Okay. I'm fine.
I'm fine, guys. I just...

508
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,445
I got overheat... I got overheated.

509
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:10,005
So, come on. You're not actually datin'

510
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:12,085
- this Action Man dude, are you?
- Yeah, I am. Why?

511
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:16,845
He just... He just seems so serious.

512
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:19,725
All right. All right.

513
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,605
Come on, then.
Tell me about your golden boy.

514
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:24,605
He's nice.

515
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,205
He's nice, is he?

516
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:29,045
- Is that it?
- No, he's...

517
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,125
He's in the swim team.

518
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,245
And he's got a great family.

519
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,245
He's good at school.

520
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,045
He's a really good guy, you know?

521
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,565
Well, I'm very happy for you.

522
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,285
Hm. Yeah, you seem it.

523
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,365
Sh...

524
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:48,765
Hello?

525
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,045
Yes, mate.

526
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:52,565
Right.

527
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:54,445
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

528
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,245
No, no, I'll be there very, very shortly.
Yes.

529
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:59,085
Okay, bye.

530
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,645
Right, that was an old mate.
I'll be back very, very soon.

531
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:04,965
- Mm-hm.
- Is there any chance

532
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,085
I could just scab a very little tenner?

533
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:10,405
Which I promise I'll pay you back
as soon as I get a new job.

534
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,205
- Scout's honour.
- You didn't go to Scouts.

535
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,765
- Inside pocket in my bag.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

536
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,605
It's good to be home, frog face.

537
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,885
Disappear again
and I'll stab you in the eye.

538
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,485
Tell everyone about your essay.

539
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:47,885
It's a very long essay, Mum. No one
wants to hear about that. It's boring.

540
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,165
No, it's not.
We want to hear.

541
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,165
Go on, tell us about
the Langston Hughes quote. So clever.

542
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:58,885
- Hm!
- Who was Langston Hughes?

543
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,525
Well, Langston Hughes...

544
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:07,285
Langston Hughes was a very famous, erm...

545
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:10,805
erm...

546
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:14,805
golfer.

547
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,965
I thought he was a poet.

548
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:24,285
Oh!

549
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:25,925
That's so our Adam.

550
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,165
- Such a prankster.
- Yeah.

551
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:30,005
Ha-ha!

552
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,005
So, Glenoxi arrives
on the planet of Fuck,

553
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:39,525
which is run by mutants
who have vulvas instead of tongues,

554
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:40,765
and she meets Lord Zortac.

555
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:42,325
And, at first, she despises him,

556
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,885
because he was responsible
for killing her entire family

557
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,405
during the war of Gamma Velorum,

558
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:49,325
but then she forgives him
when he agrees to become her sex slave...

559
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:51,485
and also, Glenoxi's a bit of a slut.

560
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:53,805
Okay.

561
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:55,325
Good.

562
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:01,205
Sorry this didn't go according to plan.

563
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:05,765
My expectations were extremely low,
to be honest.

564
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:08,245
I don't think you're ready.

565
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,805
Well... hope you find someone who is.

566
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:15,685
Yeah? Me too.

567
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:27,045
Hey, thief. How’s your lock?

568
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:32,205
Er... Yeah, it's, erm...
life-changing, actually.

569
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:34,285
- Yeah.
- Was that your girlfriend?

570
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:37,405
No!
Er, definitely not. Erm...

571
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:39,685
I'm just destined to be alone.

572
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,165
- Your dad's inside. Shall I get him?
- Nah, don’t bother.

573
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:50,365
I think my dad likes your mum.

574
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:53,605
He changed his shirt three times
and put on way too much aftershave.

575
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,805
Well, my mum doesn't really do boyfriends.

576
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,085
She's a man-eater.

577
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,685
That's kind of a weird way
to describe your mother.

578
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:02,285
It's kind of weird that you
drive your dad around everywhere.

579
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,805
- Doesn't he have a licence?
- He's a drunk.

580
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,245
I'm so sorry. Er... I... I...

581
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,605
That was stupid, I didn't... I...

582
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:12,885
I'm messing with you.

583
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,485
Yeah, no, he just got caught
speeding too many times.

584
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,845
He's had his licence suspended
for six months, yeah.

585
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:21,525
My sister does mornings
and I do afternoons and nights.

586
00:37:22,645 --> 00:37:25,885
It's like you're the parent
and he's a... he's a big, hairy child.

587
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:27,845
Yeah.

588
00:37:31,285 --> 00:37:32,765
Do you wanna go out with me?

589
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:37,125
Well, I think you're funny,
and I wanna go out with you.

590
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:40,205
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Give me your phone.

591
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,325
If you want to hang out, call me.

592
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,205
Great.

593
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,445
- Cool.
- Cool.

594
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:57,725
Bye.

595
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:02,325
Stop honking!

596
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:03,925
I'm coming!

597
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:05,005
Sorry.

598
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:14,885
We should really talk
about the pheromones.

599
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:17,845
Thank you.

600
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,205
For all the work.

601
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:24,565
Yeah.

602
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:26,925
It was nice meeting you, Jean.

603
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,765
Yeah. It was nice meeting you too, Jakob.

604
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:32,925
Hi.

605
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:35,885
Thank you.

606
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:48,845
<i>Die slowly.</i>
It cuts to thousands of pieces.

607
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:52,221
- <i>Right. For the first time today.</i>
- It's your favorite.

608
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:54,285
<i>Why use your venom on me?</i>

609
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:58,325
- <i>You killed my love.
- That's possible.</i>

610
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,285
<i>I've killed a lot of people.</i>

611
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:07,085
Do I ever remind you of Dad?

612
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:11,045
Sometimes.

613
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:14,685
But just the good bits.

614
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:24,405
Come on.

615
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:32,485
<i>Anyone who says
differently is selling something.</i>

616
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,405
Why don't you ask Eric over?

617
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:42,245
I don't think
he's gonna forgive me, Mum.

618
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:46,005
Course he will. If you keep trying.

619
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:49,285
Show him you mean it.

620
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:54,085
You'll be friends again
before you know it.

621
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:56,965
You'll see.

622
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:06,925
Yeah.

623
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:10,045
I'll just be a sec.

624
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:11,605
Erm...

625
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:13,605
I don't...

626
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:16,485
know what happened earlier.

627
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:20,205
But it seemed like it was a big step.

628
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:22,925
I'm not prying, I just...

629
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:26,925
I just want to know that you're okay.

630
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:30,725
I'm okay.

631
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:54,485
<i>Hey, it's Eric. Sorry to miss you.
Call back when you can. Brrring!</i>

632
00:41:23,325 --> 00:41:24,965
Right, come on, Jackson!

633
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:27,845
Push, man! Keep the stroke going!

634
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:33,285
You're close, son!
Come on, man, let's go, let's go!

635
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,845
Yes! Yes!

636
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:36,925
Well done!

637
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,685
Yes, sir!

638
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:41,845
Power!

639
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:44,405
Look at the time.

640
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:47,165
Whoo!

641
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:10,205
- Hey, man, can we talk?
- Are you gonna hit me?

642
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:12,645
- No.
- Yeah, let me guess.

643
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:14,245
Wrong place,
wrong time, am I right?

644
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:18,885
Look, I just... I... I thought that
it would feel good, but it... it didn’t.

645
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,205
Decking the other gay guy,
yeah, that's perfect, Eric.

646
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:22,645
Look, I... I'm really sorry.

647
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:30,205
Look, if it helps,
I used this to come out to my mum, okay?

648
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:31,605
What, she didn't know?

649
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:34,645
I ju... I...
I just thought you had it all figured out.

650
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,085
Yeah, well, you assumed wrong.

651
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:39,565
And she now thinks
you're a gay-basher.

652
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:42,405
So if you get filthy looks
from an Indian lady,

653
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:44,125
don't take it personally, okay?

654
00:42:45,205 --> 00:42:47,405
S-So this punching you in the face thing

655
00:42:47,485 --> 00:42:50,045
has probably ruined our chances
of being together?

656
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:51,445
Bitch, please.

657
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,525
Pretty boys like me
are definitely not your type, okay?

658
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:57,725
Enjoy suspension, trumpet boy.

659
00:42:58,765 --> 00:42:59,885
What's my type?

660
00:43:00,325 --> 00:43:01,565
Still not your friend.

661
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:13,325
Aimee? You all right?

662
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:15,165
I've been wanking all night.

663
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:17,165
I ate four packets of crumpets

664
00:43:17,245 --> 00:43:19,045
and I think my clit might drop off.

665
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:21,005
But I know exactly what I want.

666
00:43:21,245 --> 00:43:23,205
That's, er... excellent.

667
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:27,925
I gotta go find Steve.

668
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:47,645
Oh, my God.

669
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:50,845
Wonders never cease.

670
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:52,525
Yeah.

671
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:56,685
Speaking of which, Aimee's now
calling you the Pleasure Master.

672
00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:59,285
Yeah. That's, er... incorrect.

673
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:01,085
- Mm-hm. Here you go.
- Thanks.

674
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:10,165
My brother's back in town.

675
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:12,205
- Yeah?
- Mm.

676
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,845
- Is that a good or bad thing?
- I don't know, we'll see.

677
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:20,045
I really liked your essay.

678
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,885
- You haven't read my essay.
- No.

679
00:44:21,965 --> 00:44:23,365
But I did hear it.

680
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:26,405
“We live as we dream, alone.”

681
00:44:27,085 --> 00:44:29,685
- It's very bleak.
- Depends on your perspective.

682
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:33,405
- How did you know it was mine?
- Well,

683
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:36,405
Adam thought <i>As You Like It</i>
was a song by Jay-Z.

684
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:38,165
And only you

685
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:41,085
could turn the topic of dreams
into existential angst.

686
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:44,085
Pessimists outlive optimists.

687
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:46,765
We're in for the long haul, then.

688
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:53,925
That... That trophy should be yours.

689
00:44:54,565 --> 00:44:56,045
Don't give it away next time.

690
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:58,965
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

691
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:01,765
- Hey, Miss Sands.
- Hey.

692
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,645
What do I have to do
for this Aptitude Scheme thing?

693
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:08,085
I'll find out everything you need.
Glad I got through, Maeve.

694
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:16,565
Come in.

695
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:20,885
Hello.

696
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:24,765
Er... We need to talk about...

697
00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:26,685
Adam’s essay.

698
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:28,685
What about it?

699
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,765
Did it sound like Adam to you?

700
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:35,885
Are you suggesting I don't know
what my own son sounds like?

701
00:45:36,085 --> 00:45:39,405
I am suggesting
that someone else wrote it for him.

702
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:45,085
Miss Sands, can we have this
conversation at another time?

703
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,485
- I'm running late for an appointment.
- Of course.

704
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:50,965
- We'll, er... pick it up later.
- Hm.

705
00:46:04,285 --> 00:46:05,725
Okay, so, here's what I want.

706
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,725
I want you to rub my clit
with your left thumb.

707
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:10,045
Start slow but get faster,
but not too fast.

708
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,285
When I start to shake,

709
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:13,525
blow on my ear
and get ready for fireworks.

710
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:15,045
I'm on it.

711
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:18,565
<i>♪ You know my baby, she's so hot ♪</i>

712
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,381
I promise you, she was... she was massive.
You wouldn't recognize her.

713
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:23,381
- Completely...
- You didn't used to roll her around!

714
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,565
No, yeah. It was
the only way of transporting her.

715
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:27,285
She couldn't walk.

716
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:30,165
You couldn't pick her up. She was heavy.

717
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,285
Sean was just telling me
how fat you were as a baby.

718
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:34,405
Remember? Mum used to call you
the Michelin Man.

719
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:37,725
Ha-ha. Yeah, that's funny.
Don't you have training?

720
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:41,085
Yeah, but I skived off.
I thought, you know, we could hang out.

721
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:42,405
Is that cool?

722
00:46:43,645 --> 00:46:44,845
Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.

723
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:48,141
Ooh, ooh, before you go in there, erm...
could you grab us a couple of beers?

724
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:49,965
No. Jackson doesn't drink
when he's training.

725
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:52,205
Ooh! Is Action Man teetotal?

726
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:54,765
- Yeah.
- Come on, do you ever loosen up?

727
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,685
- Sean...
- Oh, come on, it's just a question.

728
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:01,005
Actually, go on then, one beer won't hurt.

729
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:03,125
One tasty beer comin' right up.

730
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:09,085
Come on, then. Aaah!

731
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:11,045
What do you think of my biceps?

732
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:13,125
