1
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:10,805
Oh, my God, it's Ruby.

2
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,285
That girl's outfit.

3
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:16,125
<i>♪ Can I have a taste of your ice cream? ♪</i>

00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:19,605

<i>♪ No, mind your own business ♪</i>

9
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,525
What is Harriet Anders doing?

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,405
I told her that Jordan secretly liked her
and that she should ask him to the dance.

11
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,645
- Hoo.
- Poor thing.

12
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,405
Do you want to go to the ball with me?

13
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,485
No.

14
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:52,245
Oh, my God. It's like a car crash.
Oh, shit.

15
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,285
<i>♪ Can you hear the people behind me? ♪</i>

16
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,165
Oh...

17
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:03,765
Whoa. That is one rank-looking vagina.

18
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:06,365
"Apologize for being a bitch
in assembly tomorrow,

19
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,405
or I reveal the photo with your face.

20
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,925
You know who you are." Bit harsh.

21
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,525
I love a scandal. Whose is it?

22
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,886
I don't know, but it looks like
they've got Chewbacca vag.

23
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,605
Yeah, if my labia looked like that,
I'd, uh, kill myself.

24
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,605
I feel sorry for whoever it is, you know.

25
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,765
You didn't look at it, did you?

26
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:37,765
For, like, a second, yeah.

27
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:40,085
Didn't know what it was.

28
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:45,165
Heh. It looked like a guinea pig
with a bit of ham on it.

29
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,205
Just like a little...

30
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:53,205
Do you wanna meet my parents tonight?
They've been asking about you, so...

31
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,205
I'm not the meet-the-parents type.

32
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,925
Cool. We'll just have sex
in the back of my car forever.

33
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:04,845
Heh. Look, meet my parents.
Then it's over and done with.

34
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:07,925
No pressure, but...

35
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:12,685
Maybe.

36
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,525
Great. I'll let them know.

37
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,005
Oi, I said maybe.

38
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,805
- Huh? I can't...
- Dickhead.

39
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,445
- I said dickhead.
- Heh heh heh.

40
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:33,045
It's been a month. I thought
they would've broken up by now.

41
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,045
Count yourself lucky
she didn't bite your scrote.

42
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,765
Then you'd have a mangled scrote
like Simon Furthassle's.

43
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:42,805
Can we stop talking about Maeve, please?
Look, it was a weird blip.

44
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:44,285
<i>- </i>Yeah.
- I'm over it.

45
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:48,405
It's good that she's with Jackson.
We're not doing the clinic as much,

46
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,725
so... got plenty of time
to get on with my normal life...

47
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,165
and do normal things.

48
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,725
Like feel sad and play Smash Bros?

49
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:58,205
How about going to see
<i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch </i>tonight?

50
00:02:58,285 --> 00:02:59,765
No!

51
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,125
- Yeah! Ha ha.
- Aw.

52
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:02,325
Happy birthday.

53
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:05,525
- No. I thought you forgot our tradition.
- How could I forget?

54
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:08,445
- Mm.
- It's okay. Don't get emotional.

55
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,645
Of course I'm gonna get emotional.
It’s <i>Hedwig,</i> man.

56
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,861
- It starts at seven.
- Uh-huh.

57
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,525
- We're gonna get the early bus.
- Okay.

58
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:18,205
- You're slow in heels and on time's late.
- Excuse me. I'm a bad girl in heels.

59
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:21,085
A bad girl. Let it be known to the world.

60
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:23,205
I bet you it's Tia's.

61
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,925
No way. She's fat.
This isn't a fat vagina.

62
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:30,725
- What about Cara?
- No. Those flaps are Caucasian, all right.

63
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:34,645
It's probably Maeve Wiley's.
Anyone notice whether it had teeth?

64
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,245
What is that sticking-out bit?
It looks like a micro-penis.

65
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,445
I've gotta go.
See you tonight at Aimee's.

66
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,925
- What's happenin' at mine tonight?
- Study group, obviously.

67
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:54,805
Guys, my parents
are still kind of angry about the party.

68
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,005
Guys?

69
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:03,125
- It's my vagina.
- What?

70
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:05,525
It's mine, okay? And I need your help.

71
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,485
You and that weird sex kid
who looks like a Victorian ghost.

72
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,925
You told everyone it was my vagina.

73
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:15,005
You're a horrible person.
Why should I help you?

74
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,805
W-Well, I... I don't know who else to ask.

75
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,365
W-W-W... I don't care.

76
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,485
Please.

77
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:35,365
Look,
I only sent that photo to one guy.

78
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:39,565
I can't believe I was stupid enough
to leave my face in it, but I was...

79
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,405
I'd just had my eyebrows done,
and I was looking on fleek.

80
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,685
Okay, so what do you want us
to do about it, then?

81
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:48,165
I need you to find out who it was
before assembly tomorrow.

82
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,605
If this picture gets released,

83
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,165
it will be on the Internet
for the rest of my life.

84
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:54,005
Uh-huh. Who'd you send it to?

85
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:57,725
Tom Baker.

86
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,565
Warhammer Tom?

87
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:03,245
- Ah.
- Heh heh. Oh, my God.

88
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:06,205
Well, we only dated for, like, one week.

89
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,605
And my nan had just died.
I-I wasn't myself.

90
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,565
Look, I'll...

91
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,045
I'll pay.

92
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,285
Okay?

93
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,005
Keep your money.

94
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,685
- Get lost before I change my mind.
- Okay. Thank you.

95
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,285
- Hey, muppet.
- Aah. Hi, Maeve.

96
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:39,325
- Um, yeah. Haven't seen you in a while.
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,845
- We've got clinic emergency.
- Clinic? Um...

98
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,845
I... got to be somewhere.
I can't do after school.

99
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:48,365
The vagina photo's Ruby's.
She wants us to find out who sent it.

100
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:51,685
Tell her she should go to the police.
It's a criminal offense.

101
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:54,525
- What's this got to do with therapy?
- It's a vagina.

102
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:59,005
Come on, it's not... it won't take long.
I've gotta be somewhere, too.

103
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,485
- Why are you being weird?
- Not. I'm not being weird.

104
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,285
- Yes, you are.
- Well, why are you helping Ruby, anyway?

105
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,005
It's money.

106
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:12,805
- Please?
- Uh...

107
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,645
Okay. Who did she send it to?

108
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,805
Tom Baker.

109
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:31,565
What mortals dare enter our domain?

110
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:34,885
Who doth interrupt
our game of Runes of Dunbar?

111
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:38,045
- We need to talk to you.
- Speak plainly, woman.

112
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,605
- Privately.
- We are a fellowship.

113
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,445
We hide nothing from one another.

114
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:44,925
Hmm.

115
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,845
No! What is wrong with you?

116
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,325
Speak with us, or your precious fellowship
will meet the same fate.

117
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,925
It's important, Tom. Please.

118
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:04,925
Okay.

119
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:09,325
I didn't send that photo.
I would never do anything to hurt her.

120
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,565
- Prove it. Give us your phone.
- Um...

121
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,325
- Go on.
- I don't have one.

122
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,045
Did you know that they emit radiation

123
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,205
and that the radiation
can cause a cancer of the balls?

124
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,285
I don't want mutant sperm.

125
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:24,965
Check if you like.

126
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,085
If it wasn't you, who was it?

127
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:33,805
Ruby and I dated for a week.
It was like a dream.

128
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,765
But then she dumped me for Glen Jacobs.

129
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:40,965
And then she dumped him
because he wore the wrong socks to school.

130
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,525
What are you implying?

131
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,886
Remember that topless photo
of Tia Hobbs that went around?

132
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,005
Yeah.

133
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,725
Well, Tia used to go out with Glen,
and he called in sick today.

134
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:54,165
Coincidence? I think not.

135
00:07:58,885 --> 00:07:59,885
Thanks, Tom.

136
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,845
You know Glen Jacobs, right?

137
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,405
- Where does he live?
- Uh, in his parents' garage.

138
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,125
There's loads of beanbags in it.

139
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:12,845
- Okay, where is it?
- Oh, I don't know.

140
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,805
I just sort of arrive places.

141
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,765
What would you wear to meet your
boyfriend's parents for the first time?

142
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,565
Whatever you do, do not dress like you.

143
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,085
My brother brought a girl home once.

144
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,525
She wore a Nine Inch Nails T-shirt,
and my mom thought she worshipped Satan.

145
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:37,085
She did a massive shit in the toilet.
My dad had to break it up with a stick.

146
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,205
So don't do that, either,
'cause first impressions count.

147
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,485
Good luck.

148
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,445
Eric, you can't go out dressed like this.
Go and change.

149
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,125
Dad, it's okay. It's a costume.

150
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:59,245
Otis will be in costume, too.
We do it every year. It's fine.

151
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,485
Put a coat on. It's not safe.

152
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,365

- Guys. Guys.

170
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:16,645
This is Maeve.

171
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:17,965
Oh.

172
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:18,885
Hello.

173
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:19,965
Hi.

174
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,285
Welcome. We've made sushi.

175
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,805
And I've just realized
it's got shellfish in.

176
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,485
- You're not allergic, are you?
- Yeah, I'll die.

177
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,765
- Just kidding.
- Heh heh.

178
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,965
- Yeah.
- Oh. Ha ha.

179
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,125
That's funny.

180
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:40,525
Heh.

181
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:43,165
- We are so happy to meet you.
- Me too.

182
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,085
Yes.

183
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,845
I brought some wine.

184
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:48,805
- Jackson doesn't drink.
- Mom.

185
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:51,205
That's so thoughtful of you.

186
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:55,525
- We'll have some, won't we?
- Yep.

187
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,205
Oi.

188
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:26,485
- Is it your birthday?
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

189
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,925
It's my birthday, too.

190
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:34,805
You look brilliant.

191
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,765
Heh heh. Thank you.

192
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,005
Happy birthday, mate.

193
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:43,885
Ah. Ha ha ha ha.

194
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:48,965
He wouldn't go anywhere near the ocean
without crying.

195
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:52,285
He was so afraid of water,
he couldn't have a bath.

196
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,125
Mom, I was not afraid of a bath.

197
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:56,965
Ha ha. Oh, you were afraid.

198
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:01,445
You wouldn't think it, though, would you?
Can't keep him out of the water now.

199
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,685
- Mm.
- Okay, sorry.

200
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,285
Sorry. We're babbling.

201
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:08,845
But it's just that...
well, we didn't think...

202
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,045
we could have a baby, so...

203
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,605
unfortunately for Jackson, he's...

204
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:16,845
he's our miracle.

205
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:19,805
- Mom...
- Oh. Okay, okay.

206
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,245
Reining it in.

207
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,085
So what about your parents, Maeve?

208
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,245
What do they do?
Are they as embarrassing as us?

209
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:27,325
No.

210
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,685
Yeah. Yeah, they're, uh... very normal.

211
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,845
Yeah. So what do they do?

212
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,045
Um... they're accountants.

213
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,405
Great. We were just saying
we need new accountants.

214
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:41,725
Where are they based?

215
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,445
They work from home, actually.

216
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,805
- Do they have a website?
- Uh, no.

217
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:51,605
Uh, they like to work with,
like, international clients.

218
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:55,085
You know, Japan and stuff.

219
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,965
- Ahem.
- Where's the toilet?

220
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,005
- You can use the one in my room.
- Cool.

221
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:12,565
She's...

222
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:14,725
nice.

223
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:16,725
Yeah?

224
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,085
Okay, cool.

225
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,485
You did tell her you don't drink,
though, right?

226
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,125
Mom.

227
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,925
- Just chill out.
- Come on.

228
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,605
Shit.

229
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:11,205
- What's up, dick stain?
- Tom lied. He has a phone.

230
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,285
Knew it. Sneaky little bastard.

231
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:15,805
Wait.

232
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,965
Wait. Ahh.

233
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:21,205
- What's happening?
- <i>He tossed it.</i>

234
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,725
He's got rid of the evidence,
the sneaky little man.

235
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:24,725
Go and confront him.

236
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,605
- I'm gonna miss my bus.
- You're right there.

237
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:29,085
- He's gonna get away with it.
- I can't. I've gotta go.

238
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:31,125
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Clayhill Bridge.

239
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,965
That's near the bus stop.
Go and talk to him.

240
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,805
It'll be too late tomorrow, okay?

241
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,005
Coming up on my right.
I was so close, but I just clipped it.

242
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,045
I think I pulled my shoulder,
but it was worth it.

243
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:46,485
We're so proud of you. Heh.

244
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,805
- I hope Maeve hasn't got lost.
- Oh, yeah. I'll go check on her.

245
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:52,805
Maeve?

246
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:04,765
Oi.

247
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:06,685
- No. No.
- Stop!

248
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:07,885
- Stay back!
- Halt! Tom!

249
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,725
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's me.

250
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,285
Otis.

251
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,645
Why are you wearing that?

252
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:17,765
Hedwig. I'm Hedwig.

253
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:21,125
- Well... I don't know what that is.
- It's a cult movie.

254
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:24,805
Brilliant soundtrack.
Iconic amongst the LGBTQI community.

255
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,685
That's not the point. Tom...

256
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:28,565
why did you
throw your phone in the bush?

257
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:30,245
You said you didn't have a phone.

258
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:33,885
Okay, I lied.

259
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:38,325
I knew it looked bad,
so I made up the Glen Jacobs thing.

260
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:42,845
I didn't send that photo to everyone.
Honestly.

261
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,165
- It's not looking good, Tom.
- I didn't.

262
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:50,165
I just sent it to one other guy because
he didn't believe I'd had sex with Ruby.

263
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:54,885
And... And also, I was mad
that she said I smelt like crisps.

264
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:58,005
That's not an excuse.
Who did you send it to?

265
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,285
Kyle. No one else.

266
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,285
- Hey, man. Uh... yeah.
- <i>Dude, where are you?</i>

267
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,445
- The bus is in, like, a minute.
- Yeah. No, no. I'm gonna be there soon.

268
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,205
<i>- Yeah, I'm almost there. I promise.</i>
- Aw.

269
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:14,405
You better alacazam yourself here now
because the bus is here.

270
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:16,845
Get on. We got to get on it.
Just hold the doors.

271
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:24,685
Uh, could you just wait one second?

272
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:26,405
- My friend...
- That was one second.

273
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:35,485
No! No!

274
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,805
I'll get the next one.

275
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:47,685
<i>I'll meet you at the station.</i>

276
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:49,445
<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

277
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:08,525
Where's Tom?

278
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,781
- Why do you look weird?
- Why are you dressed like that?

279
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:14,845
I'm supposed to be seeing
<i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch </i>with Eric,

280
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,565
but I missed my bus,
so thanks for that.

281
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,605
- How is that my fault?
- You made me chase Tom.

282
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,165
I didn't make you do anything.

283
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:27,285
Well, he sent the photo to Kyle.

284
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,765
- Kyle? Okay, we go talk to Kyle, then.
- No.

285
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,885
I have to meet Eric.
I'm waiting for the next bus.

286
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,525
- The next one isn't for an hour. Come.
- I said no.

287
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:39,565
Fine. Suit yourself.

288
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,405
- Where are we going now?
- Aimee's study group.

289
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,925
Kyle, you're making me feel sick.

290
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:12,925
Yeah, Aimee.
He's really disgusting.

291
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:17,685
- See, told you I could do it.
- Nobody cares, Kyle.

292
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:22,685
Pizza. Thank God for that.

293
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,805
Uh, who ordered pizza?

294
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,285
- We did.
- Oh, we found your mom's credit card.

295
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,365
Mm-hmm.

296
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,165
What the actual fuck.

297
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,525
We need to talk to Kyle.

298
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,805
- What do you want him for?
- None of your business.

299
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,525
What are you supposed to be?

300
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:40,845
- I'm going to a fancy...
- Aimee, Cock Biter's here.

301
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:44,565
What do you want?

302
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,005
I love your outfit.

303
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:51,285
- Thank you.
- How did it go with Jackson's parents?

304
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,365
Not great. I kind of... fled.

305
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,685
- Where's Kyle?
- Why?

306
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,165
Is this a sex thing?
Has he got worms or something?

307
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:00,805
Has he given them to me?
Am I riddled with worms now?

308
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:02,205
No. We need to talk to him.

309
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,125
Okay.

310
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:09,285
Ruby, where's Kyle?

311
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:13,645
Probably having a whitey in the kitchen.
He's so disgusting, Aimee. Honestly.

312
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:33,765
Kyle, we need to talk.

313
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:36,765
My skin feels like a carpet.

314
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:39,445
- Kyle, did you send out that photo?
- Tread on me.

315
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:41,925
I don't wanna be a carpet.

316
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:45,085
We will fuck you up, do you hear me?
You'll wish you were a fucking carpet.

317
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,605
- Did you send the picture? Yes or no?
- Maeve.

318
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:49,045
He's out of it.

319
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,805
This is stupid.

320
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,325
She sent out the photo.
Why doesn't she go to the police?

321
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:56,885
You really don't get it, do you?

322
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:59,725
- You're such a man.
- Why are you so obsessed with this?

323
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,405
Do you need money?
I can lend you some.

324
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:04,405
Or is this just an excuse
to run away from Jackson's thing?

325
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,341
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I find it funny

326
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,965
that you only ever want me around
when you need something.

327
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,045
That's not true.

328
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:12,645
- You're my friend.
- Am I?

329
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:16,205
Because friends
are supposed to listen to each other.

330
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:19,685
And I keep telling you
I'm supposed to be with Eric right now,

331
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:23,125
but for some reason,
I'm here with you and the carpet.

332
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,405
Go, then.

333
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,645
Go on.

334
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:28,325
Okay, yeah.

335
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,445
I didn't take the money off Ruby.

336
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,845
You're right. I was freaked out
about Jackson's family dinner,

337
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,285
but that's not why I'm here.

338
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:43,725
Do you know how long
I've been called Cock Biter?

339
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,085
Four years.

340
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:48,045
People I've never met
call me Cock Biter to my face.

341
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:51,485
I bit Simon Furthassle's scrote.

342
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:54,645
I had sex with four guys at the same time.
I fucked my second cousin.

343
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,885
I'll give you a hand job
for a fiver if you like.

344
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,765
Do you know how it started?

345
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:04,885
Simon tried to kiss me
at Claire Tyler's 14th birthday.

346
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,325
I said no.

347
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:12,085
He told everyone I'd given him a blow job
and bitten his dick, and that was it.

348
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:14,005
This kind of thing sticks.

349
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:18,445
And it hurts, and no one deserves
to be shamed, not even Ruby.

350
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:20,325
I didn't know that.

351
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:21,965
Whatever.

352
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,205
Please just help me fix this.

353
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,445
How do we get him to talk?

354
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,125
Orange juice.

355
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:49,005
I need orange juice.

356
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,245
<i>- Hey, man. Um...</i>
- Where are you?

357
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:00,885
<i>- Are you on a bus?</i>
- Um... no.

358
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,685
Look, uh... something's come up.
It's a bit of an emergency.

359
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:05,685
What happened? Are you all right?

360
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:06,885
<i>Yeah, no, I'm fine.</i>

361
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:08,765
I'm fine. I have to do something.

362
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:11,525
I'm gonna jump on the next bus,
and I'll meet you after the movie.

363
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:15,005
I-I don't know, man.
Uh, I'm not feelin' it anymore.

364
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,445
I think I might just go home.

365
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:19,885
Okay, okay. Well... call me when you
get back home and let's hang out.

366
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,325
<i>It's your birthday.
We have to do something.</i>

367
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:26,005
I'm sorry, and I'm gonna
make it up to you, I promise.

368
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:28,485
Okay, I'll speak to you in a bit.

369
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:29,685
Okay, bye.

370
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,085
Thirteen hours until the big reveal.

371
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,205
Whoever came up with this
is an evil genius.

372
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:53,205
Ha ha. I am so impressed.

373
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,445
That better be pizza.

374
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,005
Hi. I'm here for the study group.

375
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,645
Um, Ruby told me about it.

376
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:10,885
I'm-I'm Steve. I'm new at school.

377
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:14,125
This isn't actually a study group.
We smoke weed and bitch about people.

378
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,685
Ruby likes to invite guys
she thinks are hot.

379
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,525
Oh.

380
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:24,765
Oh, I actually... I kind of need to study.
I've got a ton of trigonometry homework.

381
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,405
Um...

382
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,525
Okay. Uh, thanks, though.

383
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,525
Wait. Wait.

384
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,365
I could help you study, if you like.

385
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:53,405
<i>♪ Ain't no love in the heart of the city ♪</i>

386
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,261
<i>- ♪ Ain't no love... ♪</i>
- Sorry. Excuse me.

387
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:58,845
- Is this the bus for Moordale?
- No.

388
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:03,245
<i>♪ Ain't no love ♪</i>

389
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:06,125
<i>♪ And it's sure 'nough a pity ♪</i>

390
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,645
<i>♪ Ain't no love... ♪</i>

391
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,325
Sorry, excuse me.

392
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:14,365
Did you see anyone take my coat?
It had my phone and my wallet in it.

393
00:24:14,445 --> 00:24:17,765
Did you see anybody take my coat?
It had my phone and wallet in it.

394
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:21,925
- It was tiger print.
- <i>♪ In this great big old town ♪</i>

395
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:26,925
Sorry. Did you see anybody take my coat?
It had my phone and wallet in...

396
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,925
- <i>♪ Ain't no love ♪</i>
- God.

398
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:38,285
<i>♪ Ain't no love in the heart of the city ♪</i>

399
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:41,885
Why do people send out naked pictures
of themselves, anyway?

400
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:45,325
It's a thrill thing. You know, when you
do something you're not supposed to,

401
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:46,965
but somehow it makes it better.

402
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:50,525
Not that I've done it, obviously.

403
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:53,565
- Lone genitals aren't really my thing.
- Yeah?

404
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:56,485
I'm just saying,
I can see why people do it.

405
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,965
It's like not paying for a train ticket.

406
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,125
Or finding a lost wallet
and keeping the money.

407
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:05,325
You know it's wrong, but it feels good.

408
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:07,605
I would never take money
out of a lost wallet.

409
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:10,805
Have you ever done anything
you're not supposed to, Otis?

410
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,405
Yeah.

411
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:13,805
Like what?

412
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:18,285
I... don't-I don't back up my hard drive
sometimes, if I'm tired.

413
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,125
Wow.

414
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:23,445
Yep, it's that one.

415
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:26,205
Steal something.

416
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,365
- No.
- Yeah.

417
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,125
- No. Why would I steal?
- Yeah.

418
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:33,565
- Because I dare you.
- So?

419
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:35,365
- I dare you to do it.
- Wh...

420
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:37,501
- I dare you. Come on, it's easy.
- Don't. I can't...

421
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:38,781
- Just live a little.
- I'm not...

422
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,045
Shh. It's fine.

423
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:01,045
Whoo.

424
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:10,725
You were a man. Now you're not.

425
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:13,445
Yeah, his shift is over.

426
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:14,525
- Hi...
- Hi.

427
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:15,885
Otis.

428
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:18,165
I'm supposed to be Hedwig.

429
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,045
Oh. I love that film.

430
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,405
- You all right?
- Hmm.

431
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:32,045
I'm all good. I'm just casual.

432
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,885
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

433
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:37,765
You just seem a bit nervous.

434
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,445
Hmm? Why-Why would I be nervous?
I'm not...

435
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:45,645
Were you intending to pay for that?

436
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:48,685
- Yeah.
- You weren't, were you?

437
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:52,645
I don't know why I did that. I...
I've never done anything like that before.

438
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:55,805
Yeah, I can tell. You're an awful thief.

439
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:58,005
How much is it? Is it, like, 50p?

440
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,725
I'm obligated to call the police.

441
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:04,205
- Don't. Please.
- Yes, Otis.

442
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,405
Ha ha ha ha ha.

443
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:10,485
I'm joking.

444
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:14,085
- Really?
- Yeah.

445
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:15,765
It's on me.

446
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:18,405
Okay.

447
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:21,645
- Heh. Thank you.
- It's okay.

448
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:23,765
- Heh heh.
- Thank you.

449
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:24,965
You're welcome.

450
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:31,405
I got caught.

451
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:32,725
Of course you did.

452
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:42,765
I get sent images all the time.

453
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,845
You know, tits...

454
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:49,365
minges... the occasional butthole.

455
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:52,645
Kyle, the vagina. The one sent out
this morning. Did you send it?

456
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,925
No. I keep all the pictures
for my own personal collection.

457
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:59,645
I'm more of a connoisseur
of amateur erotica.

458
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:01,005
Kyle, that's disgusting.

459
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:03,525
Yeah, I know.

460
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:06,605
Okay. Get lost now.

461
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,125
- Go on.
- Unh.

462
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:12,925
- Go on.
- Come on.

463
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:17,725
Well, was it him?

464
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:19,365
I don't think so.

465
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:22,365
Well, we're running out of time.
You're really shit at helping.

466
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,725
- She's just doing you a favor.
- Ah.

467
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,285
What's going on?

468
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:30,765
- My life is over.
- Why? Rubes, what's wrong?

469
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:35,325
That minge
everyone's been laughing at all day...

470
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:39,165
it's mine, and I'm fucked.

471
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:40,565
I'm totally fucked.

472
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,165
Go and sit.

473
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:52,005
Ruby, um...

474
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:55,085
Okay, look, worst-case scenario...

475
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:57,965
photo goes out,
everyone in school knows it's you,

476
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,285
and you could be humiliated.

477
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,365
- You're not making me feel better.
- But only if you let yourself be.

478
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:07,965
Everyone has bodies, right.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

479
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:11,605
I have a... I have a funky-looking toe.

480
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:14,125
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Otis, don't.
- And I...

481
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,725
- It looks like a thumb.
- Yuck.

482
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:20,085
Anyway, point is, whoever did this

483
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:23,125
is intending to shame you,
but it won't work if you don't let them.

484
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:26,165
If they want to shame me, why haven't they
revealed who I am already?

485
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:28,685
- This is torture.
- Oh, my God.

486
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:31,245
It's a girl.

487
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,165
We thought it was a boy. It's a girl.

488
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:37,565
Emotional blackmail, demanding an apology.
This is some girl shit.

489
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:39,205
What girls hate you, Ruby?

490
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,645
All of them. I'm a bitch, Maeve.
I'm a bitch to everyone.

491
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:44,765
- Yeah.
- I need to go home now.

492
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:46,085
Olivia, can you call me a taxi?

493
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,365
- Use my phone.
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:57,525
Who else knows your passcode, Ruby?

495
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:59,085
No one. Just Liv.

496
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,365
You?

497
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:16,525
Are you a bodybuilder?

498
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:20,805
Ahem.

499
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:25,805
Sorry, I get a bit lost in math sometimes.
Were you speaking?

500
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:28,485
Are you some kind of bodybuilder?

501
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,485
Your arms are, like, really big.

502
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:33,405
Oh, thanks.
Yeah. I love working out.

503
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:37,805
I'd like to compete one day, but, um,
I have underdeveloped calf muscles.

504
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,245
Oh, I'm sorry.

505
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:42,805
Nah, it's okay. I also love maths.

506
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,645
So, I have options.

507
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:46,165
What about you?

508
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:52,005
Uh... I don't really know
what I wanna do when I leave school.

509
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:54,685
- Mm.
- I always know when I have a spot coming.

510
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,685
So maybe I'll become a facialist.

511
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:05,085
- How's the trigonometry?
- Yeah, it's super-hard.

512
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:09,925
But so is algebra. I'll probably have to
choose one or the other next year.

513
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:11,245
It's a really tough choice.

514
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,605
Have you ever tried a mind map?

515
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,165
I love mind maps.

516
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:30,045
Here, I'll do it.

517
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,445
Where you goin'?

518
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:33,645
Excuse me, miss.

519
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:37,765
- Want a lift?
- Um, no, thank you.

520
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,525
Look at him.

521
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:45,125
Have you got a penis, Miss?

522
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:48,085
Go on, show us your dick.

523
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,725
Just leave me alone, please.

524
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:52,925
You gay fuck.

525
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:58,685
Please, please. This-This isn't me.
It's-It's a costume.

526
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:00,845
I was going to see a film with a friend.
I'm not a...

527
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:04,965
Yeah, fuck 'im.

528
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:08,645
I wasn't gonna send it to anyone.

529
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:11,685
- I just wanted her to know how it feels.
- What are you talking about?

530
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:16,645
You say mean shit to me
every day, Ruby.

531
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:19,605
"Your bag's fake. Your mascara's clumpy.

532
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:22,221
You'll never have the right body type
to get a proper thigh gap."

533
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,165
You don't, Olivia. It's a fact.

534
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:25,405
See? She's horrible.

535
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,765
I think what Olivia is saying
is she feels overly criticized by you,

536
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:32,205
which is still not an excuse
to blackmail someone.

537
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,845
I only did it so she can feel what I feel
just for one day.

538
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:37,645
I don't say what's wrong with you
to make you feel bad.

539
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,605
I do it to be helpful.

540
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:42,005
Maybe Olivia wants a friend
that supports her.

541
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,885
But we say nasty stuff about everyone.

542
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:47,925
Yes, but you have to accept
the imperfect parts of people, too.

543
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:50,285
How do you guys trust each other, if not?

544
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,885
I'm really sorry, Ruby.

545
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:01,525
I hate you. I'm going home.

546
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:07,525
Fine. She's such a bitch.

547
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:14,365
Hmm. Heh.

548
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:18,965
How'd you know it was a girl?

549
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,565
I read a lot of true crime.

550
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:48,005
- Are you all right, mate? You're bleeding.
- Yeah.

551
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:49,925
- Here, sit down.
- Yeah, I'm okay. Um...

552
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:52,965
- I'm okay. Heh heh. I'm okay.
- Sit down.

553
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:54,645
- Anyone got a tissue?
- Yeah.

554
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:59,245
- Yeah, no, I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Here you go, babes. You sure?

555
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:02,365
Yeah. Uh, I just-I just need to use
somebody's phone.

556
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:05,205
I've-I've had all my stuff stolen,
and I just need to go home.

557
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,965
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Oh. Here you go, mate.

558
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,845
Thanks. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm good.

559
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,725
Hi.

560
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:25,925
Hi. It's Eric. Um...
something bad has happened.

561
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:27,525
Can you come and pick me up?

562
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,525
What are you gonna tell Jackson?

563
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:42,925
Diarrhea attack.

564
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:44,365
- God.
- Heh heh.

565
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:47,405
He's never gonna
speak to me again, is he?

566
00:34:48,445 --> 00:34:49,845
Why didn't you say goodbye?

567
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:52,605
I was letting him off the hook.

568
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:57,085
They're not gonna want their golden boy
dating someone like me anyway, so...

569
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:58,805
why go through the fake stuff?

570
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:02,805
Yeah, well... ahem...
If you don't open yourself up,

571
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:04,645
- you're never gonna find out.
- No.

572
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:07,525
- No therapy, remember.
- What? Oh. Oh, sorry.

573
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:13,845
You all right?

574
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:15,765
I've got a jumper.

575
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,085
- So chivalrous.
- Heh.

576
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:22,085
Well, actually,
there's Nutella on it, so not exactly.

577
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:23,165
Great.

578
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,445
Why are your arms so freakishly long?

579
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:36,005
They're not.

580
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:39,325
- Just roll up your sleeves, you fool.
- Heh.

581
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,765
This one.

582
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:55,085
I'm a virgin.

583
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:56,765
- What?
- I...

584
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:01,005
I'm a virgin, and I-I thought
you should know that I am.

585
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:05,405
- Yeah, that's totally cool. No judgment.
- Cool. Glad I shared.

586
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:09,245
I'm gonna head off now.

587
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:11,685
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

588
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,765
Yeah.

589
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:19,965
- You okay getting home?
- Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

590
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:41,845
Mom.

591
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:44,565
Is everything all right?

592
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:49,925
Eric.

593
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,845
I'll leave you boys to talk.

594
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:04,245
I'm sorry, dude. This... This thing
came up with-with Maeve and the clinic,

595
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:09,085
and it was serious,
but this crazy thing happened.

596
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:11,165
I think we had a moment.

597
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:13,925
It was full-on, and I... I messed it up.

598
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:18,485
- What happened to your face?
- You were with Maeve?

599
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:22,645
Yeah. Yeah, it was-it was because of
the photo that's going round.

600
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:26,765
You left me alone dressed like this
because you wanted to hang out with Maeve?

601
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,645
No, no, not on purpose. But...

602
00:37:28,725 --> 00:37:32,485
Oh, you are so self-centered.
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

603
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:36,365
What? That-That's not fair.

604
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:38,765
Eric... why are you so angry?

605
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:41,365
Because we've been friends
since we were nine years old,

606
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:44,765
and you've abandoned me for someone
that you've known for five seconds.

607
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,565
You've changed, man.
The old Otis would never do that.

608
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,285
- I didn't...
- No, but you did.

609
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:52,885
You seriously think that she likes you?
You can't even touch yourself, man.

610
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:53,965
Wake up.

611
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,205
I'm self-obsessed?

612
00:37:57,285 --> 00:38:00,885
You can't stand it if you're not
the center of attention all the time.

613
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,325
Well, at least I'm not delusional.

614
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,605
No, the truth is, Eric,
you're only angry right now

615
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,605
because I'm getting a life
beyond our friendship,

616
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:07,925
and you can't deal with it.

617
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,285
I rang your mom to pick me up
because this is where I felt safe.

618
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,125
I think I made a mistake.

Mom's got addiction issues, and my dad
pissed off before I can remember.

656
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:53,285
So they weren't accountants, then?

657
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:59,325
I'm not a shiny person, Jackson.

658
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:14,485
I've been on anti-anxiety medication
since I was 11.

659
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:19,125
Sometimes I get panic attacks so bad,
I think I might die.

660
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:22,965
I puke most mornings...

661
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,525
before assembly and after every race.

662
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:30,205
I don't sleep well because
I can't stop my mind from whirling,

663
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,645
and my moms might be getting a divorce.

664
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,045
They fight...

665
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:36,885
all the time.

666
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:41,165
And it's like I'm the glue
that's holding them together.

667
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:45,285
It's a lot.

668
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:47,925
When I'm with you, I just...

669
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:52,685
It's the only time I don't feel my mind's
going, like, a hundred miles an hour.

670
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:56,165
I thought your family was perfect.

671
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,605
Not so shiny, either, am I?

672
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:25,525
So...

673
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:29,125
am I gonna get a house tour,
then, or what?

674
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:30,205
Heh.

00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:32,005

- Yeah?

676
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:33,085
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

Firstly, a very serious warning

686
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:40,925
about pornographic images
shared on mobile devices.

687
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:45,485
This kind of behavior
is not only despicable...

688
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:49,045
but it has very serious consequences

689
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,125
that may result in legal action.

690
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:57,805
Now, we do not know
who sent the photograph in question.

691
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:03,165
However,
we are continuing to look into it.

692
00:44:03,245 --> 00:44:05,125
I heard it's Ruby's vagina.

693
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:07,405
- Thank you.
- Ruby's got big beef curtains.

694
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,085
Now...

695
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:17,885
It's my vagina.

696
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:22,685
- Sit down.
- No. That is my vagina in the photo.

697
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,565
Sit down.

698
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:28,685
No, it's my vagina.

699
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:32,045
Now... thank you, Maeve.
Settle down, please.

700
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:36,965
You're both wrong. It's my vagina.

701
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,965
It... mm...
It cannot be all your vaginas.

702
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,205
I also have a vagina.

703
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:44,565
Well, congratulations. Please sit down.

704
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,885
- It's my vagina.
- It's my vagina.

705
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:48,125
- Enough.
- It's my vagina.

706
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:49,965
- It's my vagina.
- Thank you. I understand

707
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:51,925
- what you are trying to do.
- It is my vagina.

708
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:53,005
You don't have a vagina.

709
00:44:53,085 --> 00:44:56,165
You do not have a vagina in the same way
that I do not have a vagina.

710
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:58,965
- It's my vagina.
- Please, would you all just sit down?

711
00:44:59,045 --> 00:45:00,885
- It is required...
- It's my vagina.

712
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,005
- It's my vagina.
- Ah, just sit down.

713
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:05,925
- It's my vagina.
- Vaginas! Bloody vaginas!

714
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:13,605
It's my vagina.
