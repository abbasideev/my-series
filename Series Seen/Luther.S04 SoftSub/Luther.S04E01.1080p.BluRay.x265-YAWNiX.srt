1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,480
DT John Luther,
DS Justin Ripley.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,440
I've lobbied to be
stationed with you.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,400
I put in a request nine months ago.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,320
Chased it up
three times a week in writing.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,960
My mate, Justin. I love him.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,296
I don't think you're gonna shoot me.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,120
Don't you... Don't you...

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,760
Hey! Get up!

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,720
John, I don't know what to say.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,240
Wotcher.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,480
- I wanted something.
- What?

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
You.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,760
I assumed you'd need it eventually.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
So.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,240
Now what?

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,040
So, now what?

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,320
Your phone's off. You're wanted.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
That's why my phone's off.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Fair enough.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Nice view.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,800
Yeah.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,480
So never do this.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,280
Never come up to a really high place
and wonder what it'd be like to fall.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,880
Why would I do that?
Got enough to worry about.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
Why do you do it? Come up here?

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
You ever have that dream
when you're falling?

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
Did you ever wake up in it?

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,600
No.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,080
You?

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Nah.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,640
What do you think would happen?

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Don't know.

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
No. Me neither.

35
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh!

36
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,120
Hello, love.

37
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,040
One of us left the bathroom window
open this morning.

38
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
And a bloody pigeon got in.

39
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Scared the crap out of me.

40
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,960
Flapping about.

41
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,320
Who are you?

42
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,040
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

43
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,960
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

44
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,400
♪ Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

45
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,720
♪ She will love you like a fly

46
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,080
♪ Will never love you again ♪

47
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,840
Guv...

48
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840
How goes it?

49
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Fair to middling.

50
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
John Luther, this is, uh, DS Lane.

51
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,160
- Emma.
- Wotcher.

52
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Guyv.

53
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,200
- Fancy a cuppa?
- Always.

54
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,080
Crikey. Pretty close to the edge.

55
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,120
Closer and closer every day.

56
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
That's why the place comes cheap.

57
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
How are you filling your days?

58
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Days seem to fill themselves, really.

59
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
So...

60
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,440
So, Alice Morgan...

61
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Yeah. They gave you that, did they?

62
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,800
Yeah. What can you do?

63
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
What can you do?

64
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,320
Has she been in contact at all?

65
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,280
Alice?

66
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,160
- Since when?
- Well, since you last saw her.

67
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
On Southwark bridge. Was it?

68
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,000
No.

69
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,440
No emails, no phone calls?

70
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
No.

71
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
She didn't say where she was going?

72
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,320
- Nope.
- And you didn't ask?

73
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,960
Has something happened?

74
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,360
- Interpol caught her scent in Berlin.
- Okay.

75
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,720
- Well, pick her up.
- No.

76
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,880
No, trail went cold in Madrid.

77
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,840
And then this happened, in Antwerp,

78
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,360
three days ago.

79
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,320
- Blimey.
- Hmm.

80
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,200
The dead man at the wheel here,
Akram El Majadi,

81
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,240
small time hoodlum
from the 18th Arrondissement, Paris.

82
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
Did he have her back?

83
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
Who can say?

84
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,960
What was she doing?

85
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Well, we were hoping you might
shine a light on that.

86
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,520
No.

87
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,560
I can't be of any help.

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
Hmm. Okay.

89
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I don't suppose we thought you could...
Not really.

90
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,720
So, what are we all doing here?

91
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,560
Well, I'm afraid she's dead, John.

92
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
No she's not.

93
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,080
We found her in the Schelde.

94
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,960
I mean, yeah, it does look like her,
but it's not her.

95
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,760
The autopsy confirms it.

96
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,720
- Dental records.
- They could be faked.

97
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,880
Prints too.

98
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm sorry, John. It's her.

99
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,880
Just give me a sec.

100
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,160
- How?
- Um...

101
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,040
She drowned.

102
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Alice?

103
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,760
Toxicology is clean.

104
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,520
No signs of trauma. Water on the lungs.

105
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,040
The theory seems to be
that she was concussed

106
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
after the car crash, possibly confused.

107
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
You're saying she fell.

108
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,960
John, you understand that we need to
have a look around the place.

109
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

110
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,320
Okay, DS Lane, if you'd like to
keep John company.

111
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,640
Yes.

112
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,240
May I?

113
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,520
- Can I get you that cup of tea?
- Yeah.

114
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,440
Yeah? Tea.

115
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,720
Okay.

116
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
Boss.

117
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
I need you back in London.

118
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
Uh, how so?

119
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
Mmm-hmm.

120
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,800
Understood. Okay.

121
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,240
Okay.

122
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
So, now what?

123
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
You're gonna arrest me?

124
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,920
Why, you've done something wrong?

125
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,640
- You know I haven't.
- Then, why arrest you?

126
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,160
You have to leave the tea though,
I'm afraid. Duty calls.

127
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,400
Vivid misdeeds in Hackney Wick.

128
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,720
Give me a sec.

129
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,160
You and Alice Morgan...

130
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm aware that, um,

131
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,040
there was a fondness between you.

132
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,960
- Yeah, there was.
- Hmm.

133
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,160
A fondness. Yeah.

134
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,560
So, maybe you shouldn't be
alone right now.

135
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,120
Hmm? Is there someone I can call?

136
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,560
No.

137
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,400
No, no, I'll, um...

138
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,720
Be fine. And give them all my love.

139
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,760
Hey...

140
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400
You're okay? Really?

141
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
Yeah.

142
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,160
Everything's tickety-boo. Totally disco.

143
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,240
Thank you, Guv.

144
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,920
- You've been with Luther?
- We have. Yes.

145
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
And did he know? About Alice Morgan.

146
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,280
Well, it's difficult to be certain.

147
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,800
And that's what we'll tell
the Lokale Politie Antwerpen, is it?

148
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
- "It's difficult to be certain."
- He didn't know, boss.

149
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
He was, um, crushed.

150
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,080
The victim is Chloe Morley.

151
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,880
Looks like her husband's the killer.
Alistair Morley.

152
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,560
Dentist. Picture's in the file.

153
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Hmm.

154
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
- SOCO's left?
- Yep.

155
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
And her husband did this?

156
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,960
Apparently so.

157
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,960
God help us.

158
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,200
What did he do with the heart?

159
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,800
He ate it.

160
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,560
Forensics found what was left of it.

161
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
- Guv?
- One sec.

162
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,440
Emma, Guv?

163
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,560
These CCTV images...

164
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,000
He's letting himself out
of Alistair Morley's work place,

165
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,520
driving Alistair Morley's car,
texting on Alistair Morley's phone...

166
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,440
He's killing Alistair Morley's wife
and eating her heart. But...

167
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,360
Whoever this is,

168
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,520
it's not Alistair Morley.

169
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,200
Alistair Morley.

170
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,760
Guyv.

171
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,760
Belongs to a Julian Lewis.

172
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Is he our man? On the CCTV?

173
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,120
Definitely not.

174
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
DS Silver.

175
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,080
Wotcher.

176
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,760
Wotcher, boss.

177
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,440
Benny, what's going on
with this Alice Morgan thing?

178
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,800
Hang on a minute.
I'll give you the bones of it.

179
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,120
Morning, sir.

180
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,280
Okay, so, truth is,
we don't know much.

181
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,016
The Belgians are looking after it

182
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
and you know what they're like
with sharing stuff.

183
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,400
Do they like anyone for it?

184
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,000
Honestly, I don't know.

185
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,760
I don't know if they're even looking
for anybody because,

186
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
as far as I'm aware
they're treating it as an accident.

187
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,040
Yeah, but it wasn't an accident.

188
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
Did Theo Bloom take something
from my house today?

189
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,080
- Something like what?
- Like a phone.

190
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
A burner.

191
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,680
Well, if he did he would've logged it
for chain of evidence.

192
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,280
Yeah, ‘cause he's squeaky clean,
isn't he?

193
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,840
Eh? Benny?

194
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,680
No cleaner man. No cleaner man.
Not since that chap in the manger.

195
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,960
So, he wouldn't take a phone, would he?

196
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,920
Look, why would he?

197
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,080
He had a warrant didn't he?

198
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,880
And if he didn't, who did?

199
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
Boss, what's going on?

200
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,680
Nothing, Benny. Nothing.
I'll let you crack on.

201
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,704
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

202
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,480
Julian Lewis? Police. Open up.

203
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,720
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

204
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,960
- Down! Searching! Clear!
- Bathroom clear!

205
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,040
Medic says he ate the tongue.

206
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,920
Boss, what do we do
with something like this?

207
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,040
We keep going.

208
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,200
Trace it back,

209
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,280
to a point of origin.

210
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,040
First cause,

211
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,720
and there we will find our man.

212
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,320
Belongs to a Bruno Dressler.

213
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,160
How are you?

214
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,320
Well, let's be honest, boss.
I don't know how I am.

215
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,560
- She was...
- Yeah, she was.

216
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,160
Any idea how it happened?

217
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,560
- Do you?
- No.

218
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,400
In that case, let me offer
some friendly counsel.

219
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,160
Such as?

220
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,680
Step back and let the Belgians
do their job.

221
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah, of course.
I mean, what else am I gonna do?

222
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,800
- How is your thing?
- Not great.

223
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,360
I'm playing catch-up
with some bedlamite.

224
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,480
Following his spoor back to source.

225
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,160
Now you know what I'm doing now.

226
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,480
Animal like that,
he's always moving forward.

227
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
You should be too.

228
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,480
You know, John, we can't
discuss this any further.

229
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,920
Not unless you walk away
from this leave-of-absence thing.

230
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,840
Gotta go, boss. Sorry.

231
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,440
All right, mate?

232
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,800
Looking a bit militant there.

233
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,400
It's the police.

234
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,400
Well, can I see a badge then?

235
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
No.

236
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,320
Errol...

237
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,240
Is he having a laugh?

238
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
You having a laugh?

239
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,520
Let's have a talk in my office, then.
Shall we?

240
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Yeah.

241
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,280
- Recognise her?
- Nope.

242
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,600
Wouldn't mind though. Chung, innit?

243
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Chung?

244
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,920
That's very funny, ‘cause I think
one of your boys just killed her.

245
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,480
Callum Green,
Shaunie Mashman, ain't he?

246
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,920
I wonder how many
of those boys out there

247
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,400
know that you've been
a snitch since before

248
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,520
Cool Britannia was all a thing.

249
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
I mean, we know what they'll think
about that now, don't we?

250
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,120
They'd end your days on earth, Errol.

251
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,160
- Let's have a word.
- Hey, hey, hey...

252
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,600
This woman... I don't know who she was.

253
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,320
So what's Callum Green
doing with her in Antwerp?

254
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,920
AlLI know is that
it was contracted out.

255
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
Oh, yeah? By who?

256
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,160
Come on, man...

257
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,640
- Doesn't matter.
- Hey, hey, hey...

258
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,320
George Cornelius.

259
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,960
Come on, man.

260
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
The old-school geezer from Islington?

261
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
That's him, yeah.

262
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,800
You are a snitch.

263
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,800
What're you...

264
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,440
Good afternoon. I'd like to speak
to George Cornelius please.

265
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
No, I'm sorry, he's not in.

266
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Yes, he is.

267
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Hurry up.

268
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,560
You rang, My Lord?

269
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,160
George Cornelius?

270
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,320
You know I am.

271
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
Come with me, please.

272
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,920
Sorry, mate, who are you again?

273
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Police.

274
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,120
Which police?

275
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,880
"The" police.

276
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,560
I don't care if you're fuckin' Sting,

277
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,160
you lot do not come around here,
not for any reason.

278
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
This is my house.

279
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
You all know this.

280
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,776
Yeah, well, sorry about that but

281
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,560
I'm here now so
we might as well crack on.

282
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,120
No. Straight-up, no.

283
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,080
What's going on? Who's your guv'nor?

284
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
I've got this, Dad.

285
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Look...

286
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,160
Come along with me.

287
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
There we go.

288
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Down the steps, let's go.

289
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,960
Are you really a copper?

290
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,000
Sort of.

291
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,120
This is your gaff, is it?

292
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,000
Sort of.

293
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,960
Don't spend a lot of time here though.

294
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,680
Not by the look of it.

295
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
No, not really.

296
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,080
Actually, I was thinking of

297
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
leaving the country.

298
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Well, I was until you put a crimp on it.

299
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Oh, yeah? How'd I do that?

300
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,080
By killing Alice Morgan.

301
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,520
Or having her killed.
Same difference, really.

302
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,800
I did what to who, now?

303
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,920
Don't tell me you don't know
who she is, George.

304
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,080
Mate...

305
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,040
I didn't put her down
or have her put down.

306
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,840
- Why would I?
- I don't know.

307
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
But there's one way to find out.

308
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,720
Before I end it for you.

309
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,240
You do know they saw you.

310
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,600
My boy, my daughter-in-law.

311
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,880
They clocked your face,
they clocked your car.

312
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,280
How long do you think you've got
before my firm

313
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,560
are popping your eyeballs out
with their thumbs?

314
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
Yeah.

315
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,160
I don't care, George.
You don't scare me.

316
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Fair enough.

317
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,960
All right, what it is,
she comes to me, your girl...

318
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Different name.

319
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
She's got these uncut diamonds,

320
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,560
blue ribbon merchandise,

321
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
worth a lot of money
but difficult to shift

322
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,600
unless you've got the right connections,
which I've got, she doesn't.

323
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,440
We agree a 70/30 split.
She doesn't like it

324
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,360
but she needs the money, sharpish.

325
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,280
- Did she say why?
- Her and some

326
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,960
geezer are running away to...

327
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Sao Paulo.

328
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,960
So, that'll be you then. The geezer.

329
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Yeah, that'll be me.

330
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Right.

331
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,760
So, I give her the name of
a contact in the trade,

332
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,800
bent as a bottle of chips,
she's supposed to meet him in Antwerp.

333
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,240
Except, she meets your boys instead
and you rob her.

334
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,160
Well, what can I say?
It's a lot of money.

335
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,560
And at the end of the day, I'm a thief.

336
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,800
The thing is, she doesn't like
being ripped off

337
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,560
and she knows how to put up a fight.

338
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
She stabs the driver
in the back of the skull

339
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
with a hat-pin.

340
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
And what about Callum Green?

341
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Callum?

342
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,000
He stumbles out of the car,
gets himself straight to hospital.

343
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,640
Turns out, she's
kicked him in the nuts so hard

344
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
they've blown up like footballs.

345
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
He's in no condition to hurt anybody.

346
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
And the burner?
Why'd you steal the burner?

347
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,280
- What burner?
- George.

348
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,000
The phone I used to call Alice Morgan.

349
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,600
Mate, until today,
I had no idea you existed.

350
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,360
You didn't do it, did you?

351
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,760
I really didn't.

352
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,040
Bruno Dressler's 35.
Owns and runs Body By Dressler,

353
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,960
a small chain of gymnasiums,
a clean record, more or less.

354
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,960
His name was connected
to a trial in America

355
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
of a man called Donald Guthrie.

356
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,200
Dressler and Guthrie exchanged emails
on a fetish website

357
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,400
devoted to, and I quote,

358
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,680
"Cannibal erotica."

359
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,360
He and Guthrie exchanged
intensely detailed fantasies

360
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,120
about how they wanted to kidnap, rape,

361
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,960
cook and eat young women

362
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
and teenagers.

363
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
I'm on my way.

364
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Roger.

365
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,520
Got a body in the bath.
Dissolved in lye, apparently.

366
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Very old-school.

367
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,440
Could be Dressler.
Hard to tell.

368
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,200
The head and hands are missing.

369
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,040
Okay. With you in five.

370
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
- Yeah.
- John.

371
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,400
It's Theo.

372
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,960
Can you talk? Sorry to impose. I, uh,

373
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,280
need a disinterested ear.

374
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, of course. Go on.

375
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,560
You ever had your nose
pressed up too close to something?

376
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,880
Uh, yeah. Once too often.

377
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,200
Can't see it, John.

378
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,120
I can't see past it or something.
I'm, uh...

379
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,640
At one of those drawings.

380
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm looking at the profile
of an old hag.

381
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,880
You know there's a portrait of a
young girl in there somewhere,

382
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,480
you just have to re-focus somehow.

383
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Okay.

384
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,080
What are we looking at?

385
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,880
You find a body dissolved in lye.

386
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,560
The head and hands are missing.
What's the first assumption?

387
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,800
Your boy's working hard to
prevent you making an ID.

388
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,600
But that's not what this boy does.

389
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,120
Not what he needs.

390
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,600
So, why does he need it now?
Why remove the head and hands?

391
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,920
Because they're important to him?

392
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,400
Yeah, but in what way?

393
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Seems to me there's one of two options.

394
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,960
Option one, they're important
to him personally, so...

395
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,160
He wants to keep ‘em.

396
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,960
Option two...

397
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,680
For some practical reason,

398
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,240
they're important so he wants
to make sure they're never,

399
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
ever found.

400
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm thinking it's option one.

401
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,200
He's keeping them.

402
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,640
Hang on.

403
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Theo?

404
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Just give me a sec.

405
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Theo?

406
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Theo?

407
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,920
A police officer,
reported dead

408
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,440
following a large explosion in a
Central London block flat.

409
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Police and emergency service personnel

410
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,480
attending the site
have yet to comment on the...

411
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,880
You stay there.

412
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,960
They've taken Theo away.

413
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,080
They look after him now.

414
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Yeah...

415
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
EMTs took me out.

416
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,520
I'm fine.

417
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,240
Of course you're not fine.

418
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,720
Once they've signed me off...

419
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,560
I can come back.

420
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm fine.

421
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,400
I'm fine.

422
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,360
Where do I sit?

423
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
By jump.

424
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,520
Alice Morgan.

425
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,240
There's not a lot to see, boss.

426
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,640
I still need to see it.

427
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Guy...

428
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,920
Boss.

429
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,720
You got a minute?

430
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm sorry you lost him like that.

431
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
I loved him.

432
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,520
Uh, I don't mean, uh,

433
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,800
"loved him," loved him...

434
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,440
I know what you mean.

435
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,360
I just wanna say...

436
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
Whatever it takes...

437
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
You know...

438
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm in.

439
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Anything?

440
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Anything.

441
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
Hmm.

442
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
You got a family?

443
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,240
- Yeah.
- Your girlfriend's expecting a baby?

444
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Six weeks.

445
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
You love her?

446
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
More than anything.

447
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,880
That's good.

448
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,296
There are some things that you might
have heard about me

449
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,360
that quite possibly, could be true.

450
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,336
I know what you're
going through right now.

451
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,960
I sincerely do.

452
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,600
But there's something I need you
to hear from me.

453
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,640
Never cut corners. Never.

454
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,840
Not even if you know
no one else will know,

455
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,440
no one else will find out.

456
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,840
That it is exactly the right thing to do
because it never, ever is.

457
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,120
Ever.

458
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,280
We do this the right way.

459
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,880
All right? Straight down the line.

460
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,400
You do it that way,

461
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,520
or I get you kicked off
for being unfit for duty.

462
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,320
Lab reports confirm
that it's Dressler in the bath.

463
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,360
And we got into
Dressler's laptop.

464
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,600
He spent a lot of time

465
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,800
online over the last
couple of months, boss.

466
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,880
Exchanging fantasies about
cooking and eating human flesh.

467
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,920
And detailed fantasies at that.

468
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,960
There's a lot in there about brides,

469
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,920
wedding dresses, pregnant mothers.

470
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,560
And all of that's in there, is it?

471
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,520
- Yup.
- So, if we can find all that,

472
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,640
our boy can find it too.

473
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,040
He leads us to Dressler, right?

474
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,120
The fridge, the laptop.

475
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,840
All that time spent
running around in circles.

476
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,360
Also, he's got the time to...

477
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,000
To what?

478
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,600
To finish up what he started.

479
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,640
I don't know.

480
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,280
Let's see who's been poking around
Dressler's private life, shall we?

481
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
Last year

482
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,040
then we thought... Yeah, I know.

483
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,536
We thought you were gonna
come to us this year.

484
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,760
I know. Why not, right?

485
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,680
- Hello?
- Hello.

486
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,680
Is this Alistair's mum?

487
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,760
Who, who is this?

488
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,480
I was with him when he died.

489
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,240
Who are you?

490
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,680
He was asking for you

491
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,160
at the end

492
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,760
when he couldn't fight any more.

493
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
"Mum."

494
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,480
"Mum."

495
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,280
He was so scared

496
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
of dying.

497
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,320
Why would you do this?

498
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Ahh!

499
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,160
What do you got?

500
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Well, you were right.

501
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,640
We find spyware deep
in Dressler's laptop.

502
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,800
How closely
was he being watched?

503
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,720
Close enough to know everything
there is to know.

504
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,560
It's not just passwords and
bank account log-ins.

505
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,400
Whoever's been watching him
knows every sentence he's composed,

506
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,600
every website he's visited.

507
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,000
He knows his thoughts.

508
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,400
Used to be that we could never know
the truth about each other.

509
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,000
Not really.

510
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,760
Those days are gone.

511
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,160
More's the pity.

512
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
And how confident can we be
that the killer

513
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,960
and the fellow who loaded the spyware
is the same guy?

514
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,896
Well, we can't, to be fair.

515
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,200
Um, we can't be certain.
It could be anyone

516
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,000
who had access to that laptop.

517
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,120
You say "anyone" but I mean...

518
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,000
Well, how many people
can that be, realistically?

519
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I mean, someone like Dressler,
a man with that kind of fantasy life,

520
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,160
those kind of secrets.

521
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,960
How many people are you gonna let
near your computer?

522
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,560
How many people do any of us
let near our computer?

523
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,240
So, if he was watching Dressler
that closely,

524
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,440
what are the chances,
he was watching all of them?

525
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,840
In order to plant the spyware,

526
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,720
our subject had to have direct
physical access to everyone's computer,

527
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,400
so, we pulled credit card records
from all the victims,

528
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,960
and cross-referenced.

529
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,240
Now, over the past two, three years,

530
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,000
each of them made at least one payment
to a company called

531
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,280
Geek Patrol.

532
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,480
They come round your house,

533
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,400
fix your computer,
set up your Wi-Fi network,

534
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,840
whatever.

535
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,960
And all the computers were
fixed by one man.

536
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,120
A Steven Rose.

537
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,880
That's him.

538
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,640
Have we got an address?

539
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,040
What are we waiting for?

540
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,200
Bomb squad.

541
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,240
All right, you've got your perimeter.
The area's cleared.

542
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,800
We need to get in there, Guv.

543
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,560
He's not gonna booby-trap
his own place, come on.

544
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,800
- And you're sure of that, are you?
- Yeah,

545
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,880
Iam.

546
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,360
Easy for you to say, John.

547
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,120
You weren't here
when I had to watch them

548
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,240
scrape Theo Bloom off the wall.

549
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,240
Guy, Steven Rose could be on his way
to his next victim.

550
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,080
And we won't know who that is
unless we're in there.

551
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,320
The answer is no!

552
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,560
You want to discuss it further,
we can do it back at the factory.

553
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,040
I think I hear someone in there.

554
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,680
In fact I can!
I can hear someone screaming for help!

555
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,280
DCI Luther...

556
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,120
Exigent circumstances, sir!

557
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,080
DCI Luther!

558
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Benny!

559
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,040
Benny!

560
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,280
Benny!

561
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,400
Ben, come on!

562
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,040
Come in.

563
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,320
Benny, can you, uh, stop this.

564
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,000
Whatever, turn it off, whatever.

565
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,120
I'll give it a go.

566
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,120
You okay?

567
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
- Boss?
- Yeah.

568
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
It's all right.

569
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,240
Steven.

570
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
You've gotta stop.

571
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,240
It's US law?

572
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
No, this one's
according to English law.

573
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
When can I see it?

574
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm sending it over right now.

575
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,480
Why don't we talk tomorrow morning?
9:30 your time?

576
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,920
Okay.

577
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,840
Sorry, Guy,
she's asked for you by name.

578
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,760
Can I help?

579
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,400
Are you DCI Luther?

580
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,600
Yeah.

581
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,000
I have a message for you.

582
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,160
A message from who?

583
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,800
Alice Morgan.

584
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:25,824
