1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,240
Alice Morgan...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,760
Has something happened?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,440
I'm afraid she's dead, John.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,400
I didn't put her down
or have her put down.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,280
Why'd you steal
the phone I used to call Alice Morgan?

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,776
What did he do with the heart?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
He ate it.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,760
Animal like that,
he's always moving forward.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,600
All the computers were
fixed by one man. A Steven Rose.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
That's him.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,280
Benny. Stop this.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,840
Steven.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,120
Can we salvage anything from this?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,080
Too soon to tell, boss.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,160
Sorry, guy,
she's asked for you by name.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,600
Can I help?

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
Are you DCI Luther?

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,520
I have a message for you.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,280
Message from whom?

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,040
Alice Morgan.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,360
What kind of message?

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,680
She said to tell John
that Stacey has the owl.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,440
When did she give you this message?

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
Last night.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,400
So that's not true, is it?
‘Cause Alice is dead.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,640
I know.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm sorry, who are you?

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,640
Look, I'm just here to help.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,760
And how did you know Alice?

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,480
I don't.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
So, what, she just appears to you?

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,520
Yes.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,096
And did she say anything else?

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,280
Not really.

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,480
There was one thing.

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Something I don't really
understand, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,720
Something like what?

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,520
Meep meep.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,400
Put this woman in the car and cuff her.
Down there. Thank you.

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,320
What's all this?

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Uh, don't ask. What's going on?

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,000
We've got another one.

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
How much of the brain did he eat?

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,960
Roberta Wise.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,800
She was a professor of economics,
University of London.

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,800
A government advisor and...

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,320
And then this.

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Look at her life.
Look at what he took from her.

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,040
This wasn't murder, this was theft.

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Come again?

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
Oh, he's just a clever,
little, lonely man,

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,000
slowly falling apart, spending his
days watching the lives of others.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,256
And you know what that's like.

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,640
Other people's lives seem
so much better than ours,

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
more interesting,
more attractive, more alive.

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,656
The way he sees it, they've
got something that he needs,

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,040
so he's just gonna take it from them.

59
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,240
All right, he's never gonna stop, he's
just gonna keep doing it and doing it.

60
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,960
‘Cause he'll never get back
whatever he's lost.

61
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,360

Then let's call the police,
they'll deal with it.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,216

When needs must, isn't it?

83
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,760
Thanks for the hospitality.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,560
Look, George, I just had to figure out
who killed Alice Morgan, all right?

85
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm sorry it ended up the way it did,
but I'll put it right.

86
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,320
To tell you the truth
I am tempted to let it lie.

87
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
I mean, you're obviously a decent chap.

88
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,320
But you did what you did
in front of my son.

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,640
Once I've shown weakness to him,
well, it's nature's way, isn't it?

90
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,480
The Lion King. Hakuna Matata.

91
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
Uh, I think you're thinking
about the wrong song.

92
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,840
Well what one am I thinking of, then?

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,600
Oh, Hakuna Matata,
that's a happy one, right?

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,800
"No more worries," that one.

95
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
That's the one.

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,320
Then I'm definitely thinking
of the wrong song.

97
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
I've put a price on your head, John.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How much?

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,120
Out of interest, how much
do you think you're worth?

100
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,120
Well, probably not enough for
a good night out and a cab ride home.

101
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Well, I'm honestly down
in the dumps about it,

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,720
but you did bring it down on yourself.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,640
So, you're a dead man walking.

104
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
Toodle-pip.

105
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Hey.

106
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,320
We've got Steven Rose
leaving the building at 21:32 p.m.

107
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
We follow him down here,
down here and then...

108
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,080
Well, he's gone. Off camera.

109
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
Yeah, how many bodies
have we got looking for him?

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh, all of them, I think.

111
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,160
Aerial units, ground units, dog units.

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,520
Good.

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,520
They won't find him,
but, uh, keep looking.

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,560
"Cut the chatter, Red 2.
Accelerate to attack speed.”

115
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,480
What? What was that?

116
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
Sorry. Um...

117
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,000
Theo and me... DCI Bloom, um...

118
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,640
He quite liked the odd
Star Wars reference.

119
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,400
"Not this ship, sister."

120
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Do you know any David Bowie?

121
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Yeah. Um...

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
Yeah, I liked him in that film...

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,680
The one in the maze,
with the baby and the puppets.

124
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,520
We Are The Dead.

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
- I'm sorry?
- Well, there's this thing.

126
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,600
Cotard's syndrome, okay?

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,280
It's a delusional mental illness,
and the patient thinks that he's dead

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
and decomposing.

129
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,160
And the cannibalism, that's a symptom?

130
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,160
No, not usually.
I mean, I'm making a... A leap.

131
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,400
Well, it's a small leap.
It's more of a hop, really.

132
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
So how do we get ahead of him?

133
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
See, I think he's
like a feral dog right now,

134
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,560
trying to find a place to hide.

135
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
I think we lean into that,
I think we go public.

136
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,440
Put his name and face in the media,

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,880
force him into one place,
keep him still, and then...

138
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,160
Figure out what he does next.

139
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,720
And you think he's rational enough
for us to be able to do that?

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,120
He's delusional, but not deranged.

141
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,400
I mean, the way he sees it, he's
just gonna do what's necessary to...

142
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,120
To get what he needs.
Just to keep going.

143
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
You know?

144
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
How are we doing, Ben?

145
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,800
Like an anxiety dream.

146
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,896
I have to keep checking
if I'm still wearing trousers.

147
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,640
Well, we can't move without
knowing what's on them hard drives.

148
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,920
Guy, you got a minute?

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
Sure.

150
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,680
Jonathan Black, March 1999,
is lured into a park, suffocated.

151
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,560
All right. SIO had the killer down
as Brian Elda, local sex offender.

152
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Next day, Brian Elda
drowns himself in the canal.

153
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,320
Jonathan Black's underpants
in his pocket. Slam dunk.

154
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
Is she in the file?

155
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,280
No, she's not, but I am.

156
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,320
See, I didn't think Brian Elda
killed himself, all right?

157
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,800
I don't think he did it.
I actually think this girl did it.

158
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
Stacey Bell.

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Back then, no one was
paying attention to me,

160
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,080
I was still wet behind the ears,
but I was right.

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
When she was 17, she got
dumped for manslaughter.

162
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,160
She pushed her nan down
the stairs and let her die.

163
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,840
She just got out
two and a half months ago.

164
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,360
You know there's nothing to it,
this psychic drivel, right?

165
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,880
She knows something about Alice Morgan.

166
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,280
So you're a partner
in a corporate PR firm.

167
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,800
Yes, that's right.

168
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
So what are you doing here?

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,600
You're educated, financially stable.
I just don't get it.

170
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,016
I'm not sure what you're implying.

171
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, clairvoyants are
confidence tricksters, aren't they?

172
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,200
Grave robbers preying
on the lonely and bereaved.

173
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,680
That's not what I do.

174
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,840
- No?
- No.

175
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,080
I don't broadcast this,
let alone profit from it.

176
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,960
In fact, most of my life

177
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,280
I've pretended
it wasn't happening to me.

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,840
Why?

179
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,760
Because it's horrible.

180
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,120
I don't want to be here doing this.

181
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,760
I don't want to be
humiliated and frightened.

182
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,200
I don't want this to be happening.

183
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,600
I woke up in the middle of the night
and she was standing there.

184
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,240
"Tell John that Stacey Bell
has the owl."

185
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,800
Who's Stacey?

186
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,680
I don't know.

187
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,800
What owl are we talking about?

188
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm not sure.

189
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
Thing is, it does actually make sense.

190
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,640
Jonathan Black had a... A favourite toy,

191
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
and, uh, it disappeared
when he disappeared.

192
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,896
Of course, all of that
was kept from the press.

193
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,880
I mean, no one actually...
No one knew that.

194
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,640
So how do you know it?

195
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,560
She's here.

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,840
She's standing behind you.

197
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,160
Who?

198
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,920
Her mouth is moving
but I can't hear her words.

199
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,840
I can make out
what she's saying, though.

200
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah? What's she saying?

201
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,160
"Tell John that it's real.”

202
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,080
I can find a connection
if there's one there,

203
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
but, John, I don't think there is.

204
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,520
That pervy lad died years ago.

205
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Alice died a couple
of days ago in Antwerp.

206
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,200
There's no connection.

207
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,560
So, because you can't believe
it's true, logically, it's false.

208
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,040
Is that really an argument now, eh?

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
Benny, listen to me.
I told Alice Morgan about this.

210
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,240
I told her about
Jonathan Black, Stacey Bell.

211
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,720
I told her how it made me feel.

212
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,640
How I couldn't...
How I couldn't put it right.

213
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,040
What did she say?

214
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
"Let's find Stacey Bell
and set her on fire."

215
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,040
Well, that's not the point.

216
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,280
I don't know...
I don't know what the point is.

217
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,920
The point is, I told Alice Morgan.
I didn't tell anybody else.

218
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,960
The only way that Megan could know that
is if Alice Morgan told her.

219
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
That's it.

220
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,080
Now...

221
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,360
She knows something.
She knows something.

222
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,360
I don't know what it is,
but I just need to know.

223
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,840
Well, if it can be done,
consider it done.

224
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,960
Are you getting anywhere?

225
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Somewhere.

226
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
You all right there?

227
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,840
He killed Theo, Benny.

228
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,360
I want to find him.

229
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,520
I want to rip his heart out and eat it.

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,040
So hurry up.

231
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,640
- DS Lane?
- Boss?

232
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,520
I need you to go to
Steven Rose's place of work.

233
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,240
I want you to speak to his boss, his
colleagues, friends, lovers, whoever.

234
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,696
Find out what there is
to know about him.

235
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,200
See what there is on him.

236
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,440
What's this, busy work
to keep me out of your hair?

237
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,000
Nope. Chop-chop.

238
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,000
Morning, babe. You awake?

239
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,920
No, no.

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,120
No, everything's fine.
It's fine. I just, uh...

241
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Well, I'm just calling
because I don't want you to worry.

242
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,200
Look, I'm gonna be home
the minute I can.

243
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,720
Yes, I will.

244
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,520
I promise.

245
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,040
I love you, too.

246
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
Sleep. Sleep.

247
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,096
Leave a message after the beep.

248
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,000
Mum, it's Declan. I just got your text.

249
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,760
Is everything all right?

250
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,960
- You all right?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,120
Actually, I don't know.
It's just a bit weird. It's me mum.

252
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Do you mind if I nip off for a bit?

253
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Nah, you go on, mate.

254
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Cheers, Mohan.

255
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,840
Tara Black?

256
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,760
So, uh, how have you been?

257
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,400
I remember you. Constable Luther.

258
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,520
You were very kind.
Seemed to care about my brother.

259
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,840
Well, thank you. I did.

260
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,360
I don't wanna upset you or worry you,

261
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,920
but when someone approaches us
with fresh information,

262
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
we're obliged to review the case.

263
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
So that's what this is?
Fresh information?

264
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,400
During the investigation, we, um...

265
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,480
- Withheld information.
- Jon's owlie.

266
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,960
Yeah, I...

267
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,840
Have you been talking
to someone about that?

268
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,320
Not that I can think of.

269
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,120
Not any pushy journalist or anyone
saying that they're a psychic.

270
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
- No. Why?
- No?

271
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,640
Well, it's just, um...

272
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,240
Sorry, can I just look at that?

273
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
Do you remember this girl here?

274
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,360
Certainly, yeah. Stacey Bell.

275
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,680
Everyone's
favourite worst nightmare.

276
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
She made Jonathan's life hell.

277
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
Wicked little cow.

278
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,200
Is this about Stacey?

279
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,920
Um, why do you say that?

280
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,280
‘Cause you know they
moved her back here, yeah?

281
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,680
What, back here, on the estate?

282
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
Saw her down at the shop.

283
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,280
She, uh...

284
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,160
Asked me how I was doing,
I said it was fine.

285
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,840
She said it was a shame
about my brother.

286
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,520
And then she laughed.

287
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,880
You okay?

288
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
It's okay.

289
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Stacey, is it?

290
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,840
It's not. No.

291
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,040
You sure?

292
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
‘Cause you remind me of someone I knew.

293
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,520
- Who, your mum?
- No.

294
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,680
No, this little girl
I knew a long way back.

295
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,400
I often wonder what happened to her.

296
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,160
Why is that, then?

297
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,840
You like to think about her when you
have a little play with yourself?

298
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,600
See, that's exactly
the sort of thing she would say

299
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,520
if she was here.

300
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,400
Except she's not here, is she?

301
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,840
Apparently not.

302
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,864
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

303
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,920
Sorry,
we can't get to the phone right now.

304
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,280
So please leave a message
after the beep.

305
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,280
Mom, it's Declan.
I shouldn't be too long.

306
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,160
I'm just stuck in
a bit of traffic, all right?

307
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,680
I'll see you soon. Bye.

308
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,280
Wotcher?

309
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,560
George?

310
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,840
All right, John,
you're still with us then.

311
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,720
Just about. One of your boys
had a pop at me.

312
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Well, obviously, I don't know
what you're talking about, Officer.

313
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,080
If I did, I'd probably say
they wouldn't be my boys specifically.

314
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,200
See, if you've been
green-lit, allegedly,

315
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,600
every would-be hitman
in London would be after you.

316
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,080
- How was it, by the way?
- Rubbish.

317
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,200
Whoopsie daisy.

318
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,960
So, how can I help?

319
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,240
George, just lay off.

320
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,160
I've got a nutjob running
around London eating people.

321
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,400
And I've got a dead kid.

322
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,576
What do you mean, "dead kid"?

323
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,160
Yeah. No, you and me,
we're old school, right?

324
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,200
We're on the same page
when it comes to dead kids.

325
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,880
What's this? Billy Bacon and the
Self-Centered Cockney Villain?

326
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
The thing is, George,

327
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,840
I think this dead kid
is connected to our thing.

328
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,600
- Alice Morgan.
- How?

329
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,200
Like I said, I'm not sure,
but I know it's connected.

330
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,280
What are we now, psychic?

331
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,440
Yeah. Funny you should say that.

332
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,880
And on the basis of this
funny feeling in your belly,

333
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,440
you're asking for what,
stay of execution?

334
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,960
They broke the mould after
you popped out, didn't they?

335
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,320
Yeah, that's what my mum used to say.

336
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,720
Your sainted mother?

337
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,280
Is this another appeal
to my maudlin eastern heart?

338
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,800
No, whatever.

339
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,400
Well, I hated my mother, John.

340
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,400
And green-lit is green-lit, I'm afraid.
It's out of my hands.

341
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,080
I'll see you on the other
side of the veil.

342
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
Mom? Dad?

343
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,520
Mom? Dad?

344
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Mom?

345
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Was it there?

346
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,680
You ever hear of the

347
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,720
confirmation bias?

348
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
I beg your pardon?

349
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,200
We all do it.

350
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,600
Sort of see things in a way that
support what you already believe.

351
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,520
So, you, um...

352
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,560
Well, you form an opinion
and then you create a theory.

353
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,200
And then you work hard to prove it.

354
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,320
I don't follow.

355
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Yeah, well, see...

356
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,400
Here's me thinking...

357
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,480
"She must really know a lot
about Alice Morgan.

358
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,320
"I mean, she must know Alice Morgan..."

359
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
You know?

360
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,120
"How else would she know
all those details?"

361
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,760
Jonathan Black.

362
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,960
The toy owl.

363
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Stacey Bell.

364
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Right?

365
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,400
But then, the thing is...

366
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,840
No.

367
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,800
You don't know Alice Morgan.
You don't know Alice Morgan at all.

368
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,800
It's Jonathan you know.

369
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Wasn't it?

370
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
Jonathan Black.

371
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
And Stacey Bell.

372
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,240
You know them because
you were in their class.

373
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,280
Now, which one's you?

374
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,840
Which one's Sara Roberts?

375
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,320
So you do remember?

376
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,040
To be fair, you've changed a lot.

377
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,200
Do you remember the promise you made me?

378
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,560
She said that she would kill me
if I told anyone.

379
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,280
And I did tell someone.

380
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,120
Because you said that I could trust you.

381
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,400
I know.

382
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
You promised.

383
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,080
- You did nothing.
- That's not true.

384
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,200
I was 10 years old.
Too petrified to sleep.

385
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,856
Do you know what happens to someone
when they don't sleep, to their mind?

386
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah.

387
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,960
- You do?
- Yeah.

388
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
Good.

389
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,000
Because it was your fault.

390
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,560
She lied.

391
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
So that's it?

392
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,600
All this woo-woo bullshit, that's it?

393
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,600
That's it? This is your way
of putting all of that right?

394
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,320
Because you're petrified,
still petrified of Stacey Bell.

395
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,480
Do you know what it's like
to be haunted?

396
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,920
Megan, that is just
your guilt talking, okay?

397
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
The dead are gone.

398
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
No.

399
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,040
The dead aren't even dead, John.

400
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,880
I'm arresting you.

401
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,120
I'm arresting you

402
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,920
on suspicion of perverting
the course of justice.

403
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
No, you're not.

404
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Sorry?

405
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,720
You can't arrest me for anything.

406
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,040
Now, why is that, then?

407
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,560
Because I know what you're planning.

408
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,200
You and Alice Morgan.

409
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,880
What's that supposed to mean?

410
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,880
Conspiring to sell uncut diamonds.

411
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,520
Running away with a wanted killer.

412
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,400
What would happen to you, I wonder,
if I were to tell?

413
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,680
Megan, did you break into my house?

414
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,976
Did you take something from me?

415
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Like what?

416
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,120
A phone.

417
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,280
How long have you been listening
to me and Alice?

418
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,720
Long enough.

419
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
Long enough to know
what happened to her?

420
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,520
Was Alice talking to someone
I didn't know about?

421
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,120
Someone that...
Someone that could hurt her.

422
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Megan?

423
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,160
I need to know.

424
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,040
Of course you need to know.

425
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,800
It would be inhuman not to.

426
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,200
I'll make good on my promise.
I make good on my promise to you,

427
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,920
and you help me out.

428
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
All right?

429
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,320
One step at a time, John.

430
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I need to go.

431
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,840
Boss, we're in.

432
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,320
This is some guy, huh?

433
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Right, what we got?

434
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,800
Steven Rose has been keeping tabs
on over 200 people.

435
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,520
We've been in contact
with as many as possible

436
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,840
and advised them accordingly.

437
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,720
Anything we can use to get ahead of him?

438
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh, no contingency plans as such,
but there's a data list of bolt-holes.

439
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,960
Places all over London
he could hide out in.

440
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,520
Abandoned homes,
schools, swimming pools.

441
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,376
The problem is that
there are hundreds of them

442
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,680
spread over 600 square miles
of Greater London.

443
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,120
DS Lane, what'd you get?

444
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,080
He lives alone.
Has done for about seven or eight years.

445
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,840
Few girlfriends, nothing serious.

446
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,840
Not since a girl called Katherine.

447
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,840
- Katherine who?
- Meadows.

448
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,520
She and Steven were students together.

449
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,160
Prototypical first love thing.

450
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,000
Back when summers were endless
and whatnot.

451
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,600
She's long since married.

452
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,360
She's now Katherine Woodward.

453
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,240
Other than that, no flatmates,
no hobbies, no real friends.

454
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
No life.

455
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,096
This, uh... Katherine,
she's definitely not on the list?

456
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,040
Not listed, sir.

457
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,640
There's no Katherines on the list.

458
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,640
Kates, Katies?

459
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,240
Nope, she's not there.

460
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,416
Well, we need to talk to her.

461
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
- Has she got an address?
- Uh, yeah.

462
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,120
Police warn that

463
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,856
Steven Rose should be considered
extremely dangerous.

464
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,280
Members of the public
should not approach him,

465
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,856
but should immediately
contact the police.

466
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,336
Police are also appealing to anybody...

467
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,640
Hannah? Get the doorbell, please.

468
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,960
Owen, get the door.

469
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,640
Sorry, who died
and made you God?

470
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,200
Sorry, can't. Too busy having a life.

471
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,000
Can you get
your arse off the sofa?

472
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,600
- Door.
- Mmm.

473
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,416
These are live pictures
coming to us now...

474
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,720
of the urgent man-hunt

475
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,120
that is ongoing across the capital
for Steven Rose.

476
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,200
We will be updating you
as we get the information.

477
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,680
As you can see, there's been lots of...

478
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,560
Katie, did you call this lot?

479
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,280
Police helicopters
are overhead.

480
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,680
This is a full-scale operation.

481
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,240
Steven.

482
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,880
And I would like to repeat,
police have warned

483
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,040
Steven Rose should be considered
extremely dangerous.

484
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,720
No, no!

485
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,600
Woodwards are gone. He's gone.

486
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,400
Benny, I need you to go
through that list of bolt-holes.

487
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,800
Isolate a two-mile radius
from this point.

488
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,000
On its way, boss.

489
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,200
Red lights are
properties on the database.

490
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,120
If he wanted to kill her...

491
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,840
He would have just killed her here.

492
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,240
The fact that he's taken her away...

493
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,080
It tells me that he needs time.

494
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,480
To do what?

495
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,600
I think the thing of it is that
he's come back to get what he's lost.

496
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
With her husband, her kids?
How does that fit?

497
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,640
Katie loves them.

498
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,280
All right? And that's what Steven does.

499
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,640
He takes from others
what he hasn't got.

500
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,120
What's your knowledge of
crime-to-journey stats?

501
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,360
Uh, stats say that the...

502
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,280
Uh, the less familiar an offender
is with a given area,

503
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,816
the closer to home
he'll commit his crime.

504
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Exactly.

505
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,136
That puts Steven within
a mile and a half of us.

506
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Yeah.

507
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,120
Yeah... That's Benny.

508
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,160
I told him to send you
a list of those bolt-holes.

509
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Okay.

510
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,320
Okay, so...

511
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,736
So, what, we isolate the properties
that fall inside that radius?

512
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,080
Yeah.

513
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Looking for what?

514
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,560
Vacant houses for let, for sale?

515
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,920
No, too risky.

516
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,840
We know he needs time, right?

517
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,320
Renovations?

518
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
No, it's the same problem, isn't it?

519
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
Um...

520
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,480
Well, says here
he went on to the hospital.

521
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,040
Yeah. Okay.

522
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,360
Um, okay, so what do we do?

523
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,240
Well, we should call in armed response.

524
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah, we should do that.

525
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,440
Except last time you did that,
he got away.

526
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,440
So what do we do?

527
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,240
We do it right.

528
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Good answer.

529
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,440
Please.

530
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,800
Don't.

531
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,280
Please.

532
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,680
Steven, please don't.

533
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,200
I want you back.

534
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,680
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

535
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,360
Hey. Wait.

536
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Emma.

537
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,760
Are you Owen Woodward?

538
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,920
Are you hurt?

539
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,680
- Where is he?
- He's...

540
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,880
Who else is he with?

541
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,080
My family.

542
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,880
Okay.

543
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,600
Okay, you need to get up. Okay?

544
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,120
It's going to be okay.

545
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,360
Quietly. It's going to be okay.

546
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven, stop!

547
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,720
Stop, just stop! Just stop.

548
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,600
Stop. Stop.

549
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,400
You've lost her, mate, okay? She's gone.

550
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,720
She's gone.

551
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,680
All right, but this thing that
you're feeling. This...

552
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,080
Thing, it's in your head.

553
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,640
It's a physical thing, you know?
It can be put right.

554
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,920
I died.

555
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,880
No, no. The dead don't come back. Okay?

556
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,520
Now, we think they do.

557
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,800
But, but they don't.

558
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,760
Steven...

559
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,000
Don't. Stop, stop!

560
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,520
Emma.

561
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,360
Emma.

562
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,880
- Put it down.
- Mmm.

563
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,040
Put it down.

564
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,160
Gotta talk about that gun.

565
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,456
Yeah, I should have told you I took it.

566
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,320
Yeah, you should have.

567
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,600
You found it, all right?

568
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,880
It was Steven's gun and you found it.

569
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,320
It'll be all right.

570
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,760
It was a good shooting.

571
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,360
Hey, Ben.

572
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,000
Good work, Dirty Harriet.

573
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,160
Boss, can I have a word?

574
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Yeah.

575
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,560
So, about that other thing...

576
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,080
I had them nosy around
Megan Cantor's financials.

577
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,240
Now, there's nothing massively
out of the ordinary.

578
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,360
But there is something,
it might be nothing.

579
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,760
No, everything's something.

580
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,680
Well, she does pay rental
on a safe deposit box.

581
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,480
Nice hat.

582
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,040
Nice coat.

583
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,960
Very sensible.

584
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,320
We find ourselves in a pickle.

585
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,160
We are! We're in a pickle.

586
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,360
What if I found a way to fix it?

587
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,720
For you to save some face
and make some money.

588
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,600
Quite a bit of money.

589
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,400
Well, as it happens,

590
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,080
I often find that money

591
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,760
has an elevating effect
on my frame of mind.

592
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
There.

593
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,880
That's what you wanted. That's what
you tried to steal from Alice.

594
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,680
Well...

595
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,840
Seems a bit unseemly
when you put it like that.

596
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,680
But, yeah, that's the gist of it.

597
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,896
Where'd you find it, by the way?

598
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,776
Inside her body, were they?
What, did she swallow them?

599
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,760
Do you want them or what?

600
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,240
Oh, are you being serious now?

601
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,240
You do know
what this lot is worth.

602
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
Yeah.

603
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,200
Enough to start a new life.

604
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,320
That's not gonna happen now, is it?

605
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,800
What am I gonna buy with these?

606
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,080
Shame she died.

607
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,560
You ever find out who did it?

608
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,680
Look, you've got your money now.

609
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,456
What are the chances
of you doing me a favour?

610
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,000
Here we go, then.

611
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,760
What'd you want?

612
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,960
Cocaine, heroin, pills.

613
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,240
Whatever's lying about.

614
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,960
Well, that's an unusual request.

615
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,840
I mean, given the day job.

616
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,000
It's been an unusual
couple of days, George.

617
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,320
Yeah.

618
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,600
And where did you come across
this information?

619
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200
A tip.

620
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
From?

621
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
A source.

622
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
A source.

623
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,360
And this puts it to bed?

624
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
For good?

625
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Yeah.

626
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,040
And will there be anything else?

627
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,240
No, boss. Thank you.

628
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,320
Get off of me!

629
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,680
Ow!

630
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,520
They'll do her
for intent to supply

631
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,960
and then they'll upgrade to murder

632
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,760
when they connect the toy to Jonathan.

633
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,520
Do you feel better, putting it right?

634
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,600
Did you hurt her?

635
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,680
Who?

636
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Alice.

637
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
Did you?

638
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,240
Why would I?

639
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,120
‘Cause you wanted me to keep my promise.

640
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,480
Or just stop me from leaving.

641
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,560
Mmm.

642
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,520
It could be that.

643
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,400
Or perhaps, it could be

644
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,320
that Alice Morgan

645
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,600
was your blind spot.

646
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,640
You didn't love her.

647
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Not really.

648
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,440
She frightened you.

649
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,880
And she excited you.

650
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,760
And you mistook that for love.

651
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,280
But you would have killed her eventually

652
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,960
if she didn't kill you first.

653
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,680
Perhaps that's why I did it.

654
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
But I didn't.

655
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,480
Megan...

656
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,520
Are you scared of me?

657
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Clearly not.

658
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,200
Well, you should be,

659
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,240
‘cause I'm coming for you.

660
