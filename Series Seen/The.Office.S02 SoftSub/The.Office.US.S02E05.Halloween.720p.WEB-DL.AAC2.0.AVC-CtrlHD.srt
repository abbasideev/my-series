1
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,405
Happy Halloween, everyone!
Oh, that's great.

2
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,743
Hey. Happy Halloween.

3
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,047
Jan called.

4
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,708
Okay.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,914
I know why she's calling.

6
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,651
It's the end of the month,

7
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,559
and I was supposed to let somebody
go by the end of the month.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,188
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

9
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,735
Okay.
Jan Levinson's office.

10
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,136
Hey, Sherry,
Michael Scott returning.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,833
Oh, she's in a meeting.

12
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,570
She just wanted the name
of the employee you let go.

13
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,441
Well, I'm gonna wait
until the end of the day,

14
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,004
because the book said it's best
to wait until the end of the day.

15
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,346
I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.

16
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:54,821
I don't know yet.
I will have to call her back.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,217
I know she wanted the name.

18
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,617
Okay, Sherry?
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:05,057
If you were getting fired,
how would you wanna be told

20
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:09,000
so that you could still be
friends with the person firing you?

21
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,502
Jan wants the name
as soon as possible, Michael.

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,905
Thanks. I'll call her back.

23
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,938
I wish I could fire Sherry.

24
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,109
Hey, I'm still here.
Okay. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,377
Yeah.
No.

26
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:24,611
Okay.
Bye.

27
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,209
Hanging up now.

28
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,885
I mean, you hear
about layoffs in the news,

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,363
but when you actually have to do it
yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's...

30
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,900
I mean, these are people's
lives you're talking about.

31
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,098
You wanted me?
Yes.

32
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,336
Papier-mache?
Yes. Yes.

33
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,837
Um...

34
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,810
Pam, I have to let
somebody go today.

35
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,247
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

36
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,222
Why did you put it off
until Halloween?

37
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,725
Because it's very scary stuff.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,224
I think it's gonna put a
damper on the party a little.

39
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,129
You're worried about the party?
There's a man's life at stake here.

40
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,928
So it's a man?
No.

41
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,826
Or woman. A human life.

42
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,870
If you had to guess
who it would be

43
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,103
based on their job performance

44
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:59,806
and who you think deserves to
be fired, who would that be?

45
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,149
I just answer the phone.

46
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,909
And sometimes you just
let it go to voicemail.

47
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,920
Your costume is fantastic.

48
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,931
I know. I sent away for
it in July from a catalog.

49
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,965
Oh, no. Don't, don't,
don't, don't.

50
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,599
Okay.

51
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,639
Oh, man.
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

52
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,117
What is that? What
are you supposed to be?

53
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,516
I'm the three-hole
punch version of Jim,

54
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,151
'cause you can have me either way,
plain white Jim or three-hole punch.

55
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,752
That's great. I like it.
Oh? Yeah.

56
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,127
Yeah, well, look.
What about me?

57
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,763
What are...

58
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,062
What are you? A monk?

59
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,697
I'm a Sith lord.

60
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,409
Oh, big deal.

61
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,670
Three round pieces of paper
taped to a shirt.

62
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,405
This cost me $129.

63
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,377
Ass.

64
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,180
Hey, you guys
excited about the party?

65
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,851
It's gonna be fun.

66
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,019
Yeah.
Yes.

67
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,724
Oh, and look at you.
Showing your colors.

68
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,966
Don't you wish you wore a dress
every day. What are you implying?

69
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,435
All good. Happy Halloween.

70
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,664
What happened to all of those
spooky decorations that we had,

71
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,299
the cobwebs and such?

72
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,209
Yeah, I don't know.
We put them all up last night.

73
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,548
Well, you know what? Go buy some
more. I'll approve the overages.

74
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,779
Sound good?
Yeah.

75
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:47,946
Good.

76
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,524
Oh, yeah, also,
about budget stuff...

77
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,849
Um...

78
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,726
I'm gonna need you to find, like, a
full employee salary plus benefits.

79
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,321
Like 50 grand.

80
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,590
I'm gonna need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

81
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,432
But we don't keep
two sets of books.

82
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,904
Well, that's not what I'm
saying. Just, you know, find it.

83
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,407
Pretend that your jobs
depend on it.

84
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,477
Interesting take on Dorothy.
I love it.

85
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:23,114
Hey, you know what would even be
better? A soccer ball and cleats.

86
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,784
Why is that?
Bend It Like Beckham.

87
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,189
Oh, like the movie about the
Indian girl who plays soccer?

88
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,697
Yeah, that would be perfect.

89
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,768
Yeah, I mean,
I guess I could do that.

90
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,963
It'd be funny. I don't really
play soccer or anything.

91
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,734
Well, I don't really
have two heads. So...

92
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:44,869
Wait, what are you again?
Oh, right. Three-hole punch!

93
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,747
Okay, greatest strength.
Okay, okay.

94
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,484
A dog-like obedience
to authority. Nice.

95
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,789
But that doesn't sound good.
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,984
How about the ultimate
team player?

97
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,821
Dwight is special.

98
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:09,191
But I don't believe that his talents
are being used in this office.

99
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,635
So Pam and I
have put his resume

100
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,731
on Monster. Com,
Google, Craig's List.

101
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:19,306
We're really interested most in
jobs that take Dwight out of state.

102
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,407
Preferably Alaska or India.

103
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,207
He's a gun nut.

104
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,482
Sticks to his guns.

105
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,649
Well, I looked through
all the budgets

106
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,351
and there is one department... Yes.

107
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,155
...that has three people...
Yeah.

108
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,492
...doing the work
that could be done by two.

109
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,053
This is great.

110
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,490
Oh.

111
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,461
Yeah.

112
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,761
Oh.

113
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,366
Who do you think it
should be? Jim, definitely.

114
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,875
No, Jim brings in money.

115
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,570
Phyllis?
No.

116
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:55,274
Stanley, Pam,
Oscar, Meredith,

117
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,974
Kevin, Angela.

118
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,746
It's not a popularity contest.

119
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,051
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular

120
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,058
because that has
the least effect on morale.

121
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,052
One of the warehouse guys.

122
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,822
What?

123
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,699
There is someone left off that
list? Who? Who is he saying?

124
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,935
You're right. I didn't
even think of him.

125
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,539
No, Michael.

126
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,667
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea. No.

127
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,645
No. Not me.
Yeah, I could.

128
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,705
Not Dwight. I'm not
saying that's what he said.

129
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,546
I know that's what he said.

130
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,710
What?

131
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,451
Tell him not Dwight.

132
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,717
That is not a very nice thing
to say about him.

133
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,883
Tell him to stop.

134
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,654
Are you kidding?
Quiet, you!

135
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,592
I agree.
He'd land on his feet.

136
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,857
Make him be quiet.

137
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,631
Those aren't chips and dip.
No, I made brownies.

138
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,299
What?

139
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:58,105
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

140
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:02,480
I made brownies. And I
made cookies. Same category.

141
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,785
I'm guessing Angela's
the one in the neighborhood

142
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:12,917
who gives the trick-or-treaters
some toothbrushes,

143
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,522
pennies,

144
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,059
walnuts...

145
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,962
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

146
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,860
Yeah.

147
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:28,368
Just one second. I will transfer
you to our manager, Michael Scott.

148
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,136
Wow.

149
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,577
Michael Scott here.

150
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,553
Yes, I am regional manager
of this orifice.

151
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,347
Hmm-hmm.

152
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,326
Dwight Schrute is amazing.

153
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,151
Yeah.

154
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:52,392
No, he is actually the single
greatest employee of his generation.

155
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,356
Hmm-hmm.

156
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,092
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what.

157
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,162
You hire Dwight K. Schrute
and he does not meet,

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,939
nay, exceed every one
of your wildest expectations,

159
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:09,676
well, then, you can hold me,
Michael Gary Scott

160
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,716
personally and
financially responsible.

161
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,983
Okay. Okay. Okay.

162
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,816
Okay.

163
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,233
Stanley, could you come
with me, please? No.

164
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,804
As Assistant Regional Manager... To the?

165
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,535
Look, I've got some bad news.

166
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,373
You're fired. You need to
pack up your things and go.

167
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,643
I'm serious, Stanley.
It's over. I'm sorry.

168
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,241
"You're fired. "

169
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,083
Get your fingers off my phone.

170
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,261
So, how did it go with
Stanley? How did he take it?

171
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,390
He wouldn't listen to me.
Oh, come on.

172
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,798
If you wanna fire him, you're
gonna have to tell him yourself.

173
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,893
I don't wanna fire Stanley.
I never said that.

174
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,735
I'm certainly not going
to do it myself.

175
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,137
Get those big baleful
eyes staring at me.

176
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,236
Yikes. Just... Okay, just...

177
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,508
Cumberland Mills?

178
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,215
And how did you get my resume?

179
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,320
Oh, no, no. I'm very
flattered. Don't get me wrong.

180
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,655
I'm just not sure that
it's my official resume

181
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,025
or if it's something
that maybe

182
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,121
a satisfied customer
posted online.

183
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,525
What does it say
under martial arts training?

184
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,039
Oh, okay, I'm gonna
have to supplement that.

185
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,337
Could I have your fax number?

186
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,309
Would I ever leave this company?
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

187
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:50,572
In fact, I feel like part of what I'm
getting paid for here is my loyalty.

188
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:55,111
But if there were somewhere else
that valued that loyalty more highly,

189
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,025
I'm going wherever
they value loyalty the most.

190
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,323
Oh, hey.

191
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,765
Oh, your dress is stuck
in the back. Gotta just...

192
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,823
Oh.

193
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,301
So you got the fax.

194
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,672
So why didn't you add it
to the resume?

195
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,678
What do you mean? Of course,
martial arts training is relevant.

196
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,872
Oh, excuse me,

197
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:24,007
I know about a billion Asians
that would beg to differ.

198
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,345
Yeah, I get a little frustrated
when I'm dealing with incompetence!

199
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,151
Well, you know what?
You can go to hell, too,

200
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,487
and I will see you there
burning.

201
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,723
Fine. Oh, wait, so you'll let me
know when you've made a decision...

202
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,934
Jim is really talented.

203
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,906
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

204
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,463
Like, for real.

205
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:53,172
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you should go for that job.

206
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,476
Um...

207
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,383
It's in Maryland.
Yeah.

208
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,753
But, I mean,
look at the salary,

209
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:08,193
and it's definitely
a step up and a challenge.

210
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,689
Yeah.

211
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,063
Yeah. You know what, maybe...

212
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,139
Maybe I will.

213
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,537
Jim.

214
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,947
This is called
leveraging an offer.

215
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,783
Michael, can I talk to
you for a moment? Oh, God.

216
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:38,086
I just thought you should know
that I was just offered a job

217
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,490
with better pay,
better benefits,

218
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,552
and a better title
at Cumberland Mills.

219
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,689
Fantastic.
And I turned it down.

220
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,166
What? That would have
solved all my problems.

221
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:52,331
Out of loyalty to this
company. Oh, you idiot. Go.

222
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,431
So I was hoping to be made Assistant
Regional Manager officially.

223
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,103
If you left, I wouldn't
have to fire anybody.

224
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,339
But then you wouldn't
have me here. Big deal.

225
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,382
Oh, it would have worked out
so well. Can you get it back?

226
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,543
It's in Maryland. You could
call. Can you call them?

227
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,349
I can't... I suppose I... No.

228
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,347
They never really made me
an offer anyway.

229
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,460
Why are you torturing me?
God.

230
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:21,561
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the
slightest clue of who he's gonna fire.

231
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,536
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's gonna volunteer,

232
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,539
or be run over by a bus
before the deadline.

233
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,272
But in the end, really,
what's gonna happen is

234
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,938
it's gonna be the first person to
give him a dirty look in the hall.

235
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,949
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

236
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:42,188
Can I speak to you a minute?
Yes.

237
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,023
Michael, I really didn't
mean to... Help me.

238
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:14,062
I'm sorry? I want you
to role-play firing me.

239
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,629
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

240
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,774
Oh, you want me to be you.
Yes.

241
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:20,834
Okay. I want you to be
me and I will be Creed.

242
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:22,902
Oh, are you firing Creed?
No, no, no.

243
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,472
That's just first thing...
Came... Can't... That head...

244
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,917
We should switch seats in order
to... Yes, that's a good idea.

245
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,318
All right?

246
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:33,587
Excuse me.

247
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,860
I'm really sorry,
but I have to let you go.

248
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:44,423
And it's purely budgetary.
It's not personal...

249
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,738
I'm gonna kill myself!
Wow.

250
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,639
I'm going to kill myself
and it's your fault!

251
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,301
That's an overreaction.

252
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:55,868
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck

253
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:58,506
and they're saying this has to
be done by the end of the month...

254
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,880
Is this you? Are you being
you? Or is this Creed?

255
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:02,680
Are you...
I am...

256
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,686
This is Creed.
Okay.

257
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,589
I'm improvising.
So just try to keep up.

258
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,183
And I'm very angry.
Hold that thought.

259
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:12,320
And I want... I'm gonna
kill you. Michael Scott here.

260
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,523
I'm gonna kill you for firing me. Toby.

261
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:15,690
I really have to take this,
Creed,

262
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,734
so it was really a pleasure
working with you, okay?

263
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:20,498
Get off. Get off.
No, no. Just get up.

264
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,205
Just, just... Yeah.

265
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,540
What happened?
It wasn't me.

266
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:36,609
Oh, that was, like, crazy,
because I was... Yeah, I know.

267
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,195
Hey, Creed?

268
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,932
Could I talk to you
for a second?

269
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:59,008
You are great
and very ambitious,

270
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:03,672
and I feel like you want more than
this little office has to offer.

271
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:06,978
And I understand that you'd
want to just spread your wings

272
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,152
and fly the coop.
What are you telling me?

273
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:13,918
We're gonna have to...
You want something better.

274
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,391
No, I don't.
I wanna stay right here.

275
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,793
No, you wanna leave.
No, I wanna stay here.

276
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:22,424
Now, why are you
making this so hard?

277
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,297
I think there's a
misunderstanding about this.

278
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,596
I think you're right.

279
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,103
Can I go?
No, of course you can't go!

280
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,869
We haven't even started
this horrible process of...

281
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:34,401
Okay, Creed.

282
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:38,270
I need to let
somebody go today.

283
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:42,311
They told me I need to
let somebody go.

284
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:45,116
And as much as I think you're
a great guy, and I like you,

285
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,521
you're... Goodbye.

286
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,350
Let's fight it.

287
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,687
Let's call Jan and fight this
thing together like the old days.

288
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,391
What old days?
What are you talking about?

289
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,093
Did you start
the paperwork yet?

290
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,465
It's right here
on the desk, yeah.

291
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:01,004
You don't have to do this,
Michael. I can't, though.

292
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,335
Undo it!
I can't change anything.

293
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:05,398
This is the way it... No.
You have the power to undo it.

294
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:07,808
I don't. Okay, just let's
not... You can undo it.

295
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,243
Michael, undo it!

296
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,406
Yeah, I went hunting once.
Shot the deer in the leg.

297
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,545
Had to kill it with a shovel,
took about an hour.

298
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,847
Why do you ask?

299
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,855
I have to fire someone
today. Okay?

300
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:24,486
Fine. Fire someone else.
Fire Devon. He's terrible.

301
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:27,190
I am so much better
at my job than Devon.

302
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:30,233
Okay, well, I already
picked you and you know that,

303
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:33,202
so, unless I just
go through with this,

304
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,932
you're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

305
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:40,204
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will
forget so fast. You will be my savior.

306
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:43,474
You're the guy
who gave me my life back.

307
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,639
Thank you. I knew
you'd see it my way, Michael.

308
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:47,775
God bless you.

309
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:49,409
You're a fine man.
Don't...

310
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,147
Listen, you will not
regret this, either.

311
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,747
Devon is terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

312
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,726
Good, good, good, good.

313
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,573
Devon, could I
talk to you for a second?

314
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,472
Creed's an idiot. You
know that. Well, he...

315
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,518
No, no, no, no, no, no. You
had it right the first time!

316
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:25,453
Well, maybe I did. Exactly,
you gotta go with your gut, man.

317
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,456
No, I can't...

318
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,518
No, I can't go back.
I would look like an idiot.

319
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,257
That's why I'm being fired?
No.

320
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:35,821
So you might not look
like an idiot?

321
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:37,389
No, it was all the stuff
that I said.

322
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,936
It was the business downturn
and cutbacks, and...

323
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:42,336
You...
God, this is unbelievable!

324
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:45,398
I just hope that you
and I can remain friends.

325
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,436
Devon, wait. Please.
What?

326
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:51,981
Look, look.

327
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:56,313
In addition to severance
and everything,

328
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:59,220
I want to give you

329
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,884
this gift certificate
to Chili's from me.

330
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:07,563
Okay? No hard feelings.

331
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:15,830
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly,
Toby, Oscar, Meredith,

332
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,337
Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp.

333
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:21,735
If any of you wanna meet me for a
drink, I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's.

334
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,303
And the rest of you
can go to hell.

335
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,653
What about
the Halloween party?

336
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,661
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop.

337
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,766
I'm sorry for pushing you
toward Cumberland.

338
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,830
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

339
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,170
Come on.

340
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,272
That's just
a figure of speech, you know.

341
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:58,542
Blow your brains out? Come on.

342
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,583
All it really means is
that we're friends.

343
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:04,348
And who else is she gonna
talk to if I'm gone? Right?

344
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,924
I mean, if she left,
I wouldn't blow my brains out.

345
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:11,586
Of course, I would take that job in
Maryland because it's double the pay

346
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:15,223
and soft-shell crab just
happens to be my favorite food.

347
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:24,299
I love Halloween.

348
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,004
You know, it's just... But it's
just fun. Every year, it's just fun.

349
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:31,275
Last Halloween, I came
as Janet Jackson's boob.

350
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,717
It was topical. People
got a big kick out of it.

351
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:38,778
The year before that
I came as Monica Lewinsky,

352
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,483
and I wore a stained dress.

353
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,892
The year before that, I
also came as Monica Lewinsky,

354
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:48,898
and before that I was O. J.
It was pretty funny.

355
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,093
Oh, I wish you were
here last year.

356
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:01,908
Trick-or-treat!

357
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,879
Hey. How you doing?

358
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,006
Wow, you guys look great!

359
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,211
I'm a bumble bee.
You look great.

360
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,615
And you're a princess?
A fairy princess.

361
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,849
A fairy princess. You're
very... I'm a lion!

362
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,983
You're a lion. Wow.
I wanna hear your...

363
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,153
Oh! Okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours. Okay!

364
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:20,287
Grab it. Grab it.

365
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,229
You know what? You guys
are getting all of these.
