1
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:05,981
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

2
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:09,959
Sure, can I ask who's calling?

3
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,552
Just a second.

4
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,994
Jim Halpert. What?
How did you get this number?

5
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,661
Stalker.

6
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,229
Katy and Jim
met in the office.

7
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:27,334
And now, I guess they're, like,
going out or dating or something.

8
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,571
And...

9
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,779
I don't know, you know.
They're just...

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,410
She calls him, and they...
You know.

11
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:38,649
I'm sorry, I feel like I'm talking
really loud. Am I talking really loud?

12
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,987
So we're still on for lunch?
You're meeting me here?

13
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:43,686
Okay. Great. Bye.

14
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,896
Hey, you can just
give her your extension.

15
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,695
Okay.

16
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:26,863
HowardlRyan.

17
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,428
Ryan Howard is sitting
in my office.

18
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,907
And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months,

19
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:35,969
and he's kind of gotten the
lay of the land a little bit.

20
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,509
Had a few laughs
along the way.

21
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,913
And now he wants
to know what I think.

22
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:43,846
The temp agency wants to know
what you think.

23
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,189
Shall we? Let us proceed.

24
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:50,525
First up, "Proficiency
in necessary skills.

25
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:56,130
"Excellent. "

26
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:03,740
Michael's in there right
now evaluating the temp.

27
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,408
He hasn't evaluated me
in years.

28
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,774
Five years from now,
what do you wanna do?

29
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:11,337
Where do you wanna be?

30
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:12,939
Well, I'm interested
in business.

31
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:15,315
Oh. Good. Ambitious.
Excellent.

32
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,282
Wanna be a manager?

33
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:21,524
No, actually, what I want
is to own my own company.

34
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:22,991
That is ridiculous.

35
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:28,060
Ryan's about to attend the
Michael Scott School of Business.

36
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,496
I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda
rolled into one.

37
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,668
"Much advice you seek. "

38
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:38,134
Do you know who that is?

39
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:41,072
Fozzie Bear?

40
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,902
Hmm.

41
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,779
No. That was Yoda.

42
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:50,750
There are 10 rules of business
that you need to learn.

43
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,289
Number one:

44
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,593
You need to play to win,

45
00:02:57,228 --> 00:03:00,994
but you also have to

46
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,825
win to play.

47
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,362
Got it.

48
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,634
And I will give you
the rest of the 10 at lunch.

49
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:14,902
Hey.

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,014
Michael and I have
a very special connection.

51
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:24,077
He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.

52
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:26,783
He's like the Lone Ranger
and I'm like Tonto.

53
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:30,759
And it's not like there was the
Lone Ranger and Tonto and Bonto.

54
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,030
People!

55
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,131
Okay, everybody!

56
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,005
This is not a test.
Move to the exits.

57
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,703
Devon, head towards
the exit. Do not panic!

58
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,837
Get up off your desks. No, I
don't wanna hear it. All right?

59
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,108
Let's go, people!
No panic is warranted.

60
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:52,581
Do not panic!
Go in a single-file line.

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,277
This is not a drill!

62
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:55,613
Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!

63
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,519
Please, move quickly! This
is a paper company, people.

64
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:03,026
Step lively. This whole place is
a tinderbox. It is ready to blow.

65
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,588
This is not a test.
Can you leave?

66
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,791
Oh, you say that every time.

67
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,333
Do you wanna die?

68
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,425
Oh, God.

69
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,969
Do you wanna die? Out!

70
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,265
All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

71
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,636
Stanley, have you ever seen a
burn victim? Move to the exits.

72
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:18,641
Come on, your safety partners.
Your safety partners. Let's go!

73
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,143
Real smoke!
We've got smoke! Smoke!

74
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,206
God!

75
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:37,891
Oh, Kelly! Are you okay?
I got you!

76
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:39,020
I'm okay!

77
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,563
Cover your nose and mouth.
Hey, let go of me!

78
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,962
Breathe through your nose.
Let go of me!

79
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,126
Breathe through your nose.
Remove your stockings, okay?

80
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,035
They'll melt right into your
flesh. Stay below the smoke line.

81
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,776
Let's go! Clear out, stat!
Stat means now!

82
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,406
Yes,
I was the first one out.

83
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:01,351
And, yes, I've heard women
and children first,

84
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,650
but we do not employ children.

85
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:06,691
We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.

86
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,287
And women are equal
in the workplace by law.

87
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,028
So, I let them out first,
I've a lawsuit on my hands.

88
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:21,601
Another rule of business is being
able to adapt to different situations.

89
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:22,697
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:26,541
Adapt. React. Readapt.

91
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,746
Apt. All right?
That's rule number two.

92
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:31,874
Okay, guys, listen up.
We need a head count.

93
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,611
Okay, we need to count off.
Michael's number one.

94
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:34,743
Where is he? Where's he?

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,912
So, what was rule two?

96
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:37,979
Adapt, react, readapt, apt.

97
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:40,786
Okay, well, let's just kind
of take it a little slower.

98
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:43,191
Hey, Michael, Ryan needs
a number for the count off.

99
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,753
Okay, well, "1" is taken.

100
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:47,264
Okay, "2"?
No!

101
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,027
Oh, sorry.
Okay.

102
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:50,625
He can have "14."
Marjorie's not here today.

103
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:52,294
Well, he needs
a permanent number, right?

104
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,429
No, I don't.

105
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:56,099
Oh, you know what else? I thought
of a nickname for the three of us.

106
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,540
Three Musketeers.

107
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,240
Yeah, okay. Yeah. No, no, no.
I got one, I got one.

108
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,541
The Three Stooges.

109
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,809
That's funny, too. But if
we're the Three Musketeers...

110
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:07,909
I don't wanna be, like,
a guy here, you know?

111
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,622
Like, Stanley
is the crossword-puzzle guy

112
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,815
and Angela has cats.

113
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:16,360
I don't wanna
have a thing here.

114
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,426
You know, I don't wanna be
the "something guy. "

115
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,257
Okay, you know what?

116
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:26,031
I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?

117
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:27,765
Can everybody gather up,
please?

118
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,104
Important announcement.
Very important announcement.

119
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:34,271
I think this is a perfect opportunity
for all of us to participate

120
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:38,407
in some really intense,
psychologically revealing conversations.

121
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,815
So, we're gonna be playing
"desert island,"

122
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:41,910
um...

123
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,353
"Who would you do" and...

124
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:47,051
"Would you rather. "
"Would you rather. "

125
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,524
"Would you rather"
is our third game.

126
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,560
Yeah!

127
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:03,272
Hey, guys.
Great response time.

128
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,906
Listen up. I got some
theories. Okay, there's a...

129
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,638
Okay, so three books
on a desert island, Angela.

130
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:13,548
The Bible.

131
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:18,682
That's one book.
You've got two others.

132
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:20,683
A Purpose Driven Life.

133
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,919
Nice.

134
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:23,984
Third book.

135
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:25,051
No.

136
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:27,656
Okay, Phyllis.

137
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,163
The Da Vinci Code.

138
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:31,759
I would take
The Da Vinci Code,

139
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:33,270
so I could burn
The Da Vinci Code.

140
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,637
Okay, great. That's gonna keep
you warm for, like, seven seconds.

141
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,233
Question, is there
firewood on the island?

142
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:40,471
I guess.

143
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,740
Then I would bring an axe,
no books.

144
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:44,406
No, it has
to be a book, Dwight.

145
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:45,941
Fine.

146
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:47,679
Physician's Desk Reference.

147
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:48,777
Nice. Smart.

148
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:52,881
Hollowed out. Inside, water
proof matches, iodine tablets,

149
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:57,260
beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket,

150
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:59,923
and, in case I get bored,

151
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:02,258
Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone.

152
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:04,700
No, Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

153
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,762
Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?

154
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,242
Rule number four: In
business image is everything.

155
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:13,778
Andre Agassi.

156
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,339
This car is an investment,
right?

157
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:20,818
If I have to take out a client or
I'm seen around Scranton in it...

158
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:25,414
I love it. I love this car.

159
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:29,550
Do you like it?

160
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,022
Yeah.

161
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,622
Okay, thought
people read more books.

162
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,465
DVDs. Five movies, what
would you bring to the island?

163
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:39,561
Yes, Meredith.

164
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:43,699
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat
Greek Wedding, Legally Blonde,

165
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,174
Bridges of Madison County.

166
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:46,232
Wow.

167
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:47,975
Legends of the Fall.

168
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,741
Wow.
Bridges of Madison County.

169
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,248
Legally Blonde.
These movies are just...

170
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:52,340
Well, I kind of like
Legally...

171
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:56,012
Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no. Do you understand?

172
00:08:56,088 --> 00:09:00,616
The game is "desert island movies,"
not "guilty pleasure movies. "

173
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:04,458
Desert island movies are the movies you're
gonna watch for the rest of your life.

174
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,020
Forever. Unforgivable.

175
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:08,464
I take it back.
Unforgivable.

176
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,966
I take it back.
Good.

177
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:13,569
And, Ghost.
But just that one scene.

178
00:09:17,576 --> 00:09:18,702
Is this your car, Ryan?

179
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,404
Well, sir, I don't... Some
pretty big books back there.

180
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,468
Good shocks.

181
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,309
Hello, Mr. Egghead.

182
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,583
Oh, Stanley Kaplan.
I know him.

183
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,881
"M" is for Murder,
"P" is for...

184
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:30,819
That's actually a test-prep
book.... for Phone. What?

185
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,618
That's a test-prep
for business school.

186
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,287
Oh, thinking about
business school?

187
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,293
I just got in.
I applied. I go at night.

188
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:39,330
Really? So, you think you
know a lot about business?

189
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,195
No, not yet. Just started.

190
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:42,255
Uh-huh. Yeah.

191
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,032
Quiz me.

192
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,433
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

193
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:46,937
Oh, come on. Come on,
egghead, let's do it.

194
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,029
Do it.

195
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:49,198
Quiz me up.

196
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:50,263
All right.

197
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:55,569
Why have people been rethinking the
Microsoft model in the past few years?

198
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:01,984
When I was Ryan's age,

199
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:05,785
I worked in a fast food restaurant
to save up money for school.

200
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,916
And then I lost it
in a pyramid scheme,

201
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:14,557
but I learned more about
business right then and there

202
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:17,761
than business school would ever
teach me or Ryan would ever teach me.

203
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:22,136
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer
or to keep an existing customer?

204
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,632
Keep an existing cust...
Shut it.

205
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,734
Can I just do it, please?

206
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,444
It's equal.

207
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,547
It is 10 times more expensive
to sign a new customer.

208
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,948
Okay. Yes,
it was a trick question, okay.

209
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,782
Look, I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?

210
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,116
Michael comes from the school
of hard knocks.

211
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:38,349
All right. Okay, Dwight...
Self-taught.

212
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:39,583
You didn't even go to college.

213
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:42,092
You know what? You don't
need to help me here, okay?

214
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,822
You know, maybe you should go
to business school like Ryan.

215
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,727
Then you'd know
what you're talking about.

216
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:47,822
Come on.
So...

217
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,093
I'm studying with the master.

218
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,259
Reference. Why don't
you go to business...

219
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:51,734
You should learn from him,
right? Right? Right?

220
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:55,671
Stop it, Dwight. You know what,
Dwight? You're acting like a dork.

221
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,368
Would you cool it,
please? Okay.

222
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:01,813
Hey, he's not your
five-year-old brother, Dwight.

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,371
He's a valued member
of this company.

224
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,748
And you know what? He knows more
about business than you ever will.

225
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,318
Stupid.

226
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,880
I did not
go to business school.

227
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,654
You know who else didn't go
to business school?

228
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,992
Lebron James, Tracy McGrady,
Kobe Bryant.

229
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:21,989
They went right from high
school to the NBA, so...

230
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,971
So, it's not the same thing
at all.

231
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:33,109
Look at this stuff. "Market fragments.
" What is that supposed to be?

232
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:36,875
It's a way of looking at consumers
as subsets of a larger client base.

233
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,608
You are so smart.
You are so effing smart.

234
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,415
You should be teaching me.

235
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:47,391
Pam, get us back into it.

236
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,051
Okay.
Five movies. Go ahead.

237
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:53,393
Fargo, Edward Scissorhands,
Dazed and Confused.

238
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,932
Oh, definitely in my top five.

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,127
Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.

240
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,496
Breakfast Club.
What?

241
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,335
The Princess Bride and...
Okay, that's five.

242
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:03,465
No, my all-time favorite!

243
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,770
Pam, play by the rules.

244
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:06,435
All-time favorite!
Play by the rules.

245
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,844
Dwight,
all-time favorite movie.

246
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:16,015
The Crow.

247
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:19,681
I became a salesman

248
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,089
because of people.
I love making friends.

249
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:29,160
But then I was promoted
to manager, very young age.

250
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:32,732
I still try to be
a friend first,

251
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:37,339
but, you know,
when you're very successful,

252
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:39,741
your co-workers
look at you differently.

253
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:47,378
What do you think?

254
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,156
Maybe we should get some air.
No, I'm okay.

255
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:56,455
I'm really uncomfortable.

256
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,355
All right. Let's move on.

257
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:03,162
Let's move on to the main
event, "Who would you do?"

258
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:04,725
Present company excluded?

259
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:05,827
Not necessarily.

260
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:07,496
Pam.
Pam.

261
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,731
Um...

262
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,409
Okay. You know what? Maybe I'll
finish explaining the rules.

263
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,742
Let me explain it first
and then...

264
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,614
Yeah, so we'll get right... You
know what? I'll be right back.

265
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:25,656
Stanley, you're taking over for
me, buddy. I'll be right back.

266
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,816
Okay.

267
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,154
Dwight.

268
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,092
Dwight!

269
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,099
Come one, Dwight, use words.

270
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,404
Why didn't I
go to business school?

271
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,530
Who goes to business school?

272
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:42,868
The temp.
He does?

273
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,341
Yeah, it's all him and Michael
talk about anymore.

274
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,675
You know, I bet
Ryan thinks to himself,

275
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,773
"I wish I were a volunteer
sheriff on the weekend. "

276
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,181
He doesn't even know
that I do that.

277
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,741
You should tell him.

278
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:59,119
Oh, yeah, Pam, right. That's gonna
help things. Just talk it out.

279
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,216
I hope the war goes on forever
and Ryan gets drafted.

280
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:03,318
Dwight.
What?

281
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,659
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't...

282
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,755
Just part of me meant it.

283
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:10,599
Besides, he'd end up
being a hero anyway.

284
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,238
You know what you should do?

285
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,796
You should quit.

286
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:19,972
And then, that would stick it
to both of them.

287
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:22,941
No, Jim. I'm not gonna quit.

288
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,079
Then Ryan wins.

289
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,708
Yeah, you're right.

290
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:27,979
Thanks, you guys.

291
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,820
I just need some alone time.

292
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:31,981
Okay.

293
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:33,419
All right, buddy.

294
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,992
Hey. Guys, what's going on?

295
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,124
Nothing.
Hey.

296
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,531
What's up?

297
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,398
Can I hang out
with you guys for a bit?

298
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,938
The warehouse guys are a
bunch of jackasses sometimes.

299
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,440
Come on, people, you know
the rules of the game, now.

300
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:52,772
Hey, gang.
What game are we playing here?

301
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,869
Okay, it's called,
"Who would you do?"

302
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,905
Oh, I play this at home
all the time

303
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,644
while I'm falling asleep.

304
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,313
What... Where are we?
Where are we here?

305
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:04,719
Roy.
Roy?

306
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,019
Roy? Who would you do, Roy?

307
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,457
Oh, I got it.
What's the name of that

308
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:14,523
tight-ass Christian chick.
The blonde?

309
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,294
My name is Angela.

310
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:18,859
Hey, Angela.
Roy, nice to meet you.

311
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:21,030
All right, who's next?
Who's next? Who's next?

312
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:24,234
Who's... Jim? You're next.
Who would you do?

313
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,576
Kevin, hands down.

314
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,481
Yeah, I mean he's really got
that teddy bear thing going on

315
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:35,784
and afterwards we could
just watch bowling.

316
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:40,723
Well, I would
definitely have sex with Ryan,

317
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,286
'cause he is gonna
own his own business.

318
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:47,030
You're all gay.

319
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,931
Who's next? Who we got?

320
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:53,263
Who...
Hey. No, I can talk.

321
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,896
I can talk. I can talk.
Yeah, it's a great time.

322
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:57,271
Well, I wish I had my cell
phone, but I left it inside, so...

323
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:58,400
Would that make you happy?

324
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:00,467
What's that? If you had your cell
phone, it would make you happy?

325
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:01,876
Yeah.
I'm on it.

326
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:03,311
Dwight. Hey, Dwight!

327
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,712
You can't go back in yet.

328
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:08,241
He is an idiot. The man is an
idiot, ladies and gentlemen.

329
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,685
What if he dies in the fire,

330
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,417
and that's the last thing
you ever said to him?

331
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,551
I didn't say it to him.
I said it about him.

332
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,011
Jim?
Definitely Jim.

333
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,642
Definitely, definitely Jim.

334
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:24,879
Come on, Pam. Come on.

335
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:25,943
What about you, Pam?

336
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:28,788
Oscar's kind of cute.

337
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,086
Yeah, I like Oscar.

338
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,790
Ooh, Toby.

339
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:36,329
How long does it take
to find a cell phone?

340
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,196
I don't know either.

341
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,702
Is there anybody else?

342
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,969
Hey, where are you?

343
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:48,138
Oh, good.

344
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,375
Yeah, we're just here.
We're playing "desert island. "

345
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,676
It's when you pick
your five favorite DVDs.

346
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:55,273
Seriously,
where the hell is Dwight?

347
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:02,515
Hey, call my cell phone.

348
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,752
It'll make it
easier for him to find.

349
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:07,857
What's your number?

350
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,488
I gave it to you in the car.

351
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,568
I saw you program it in.

352
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:16,132
You gotta give it to me again.

353
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:17,467
Okay. All right.

354
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,700
Now I have it.

355
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,079
Uh...

356
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,420
I better tell somebody.

357
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:39,120
Excuse me, sir?

358
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,621
Dwight! Dwight!

359
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:44,564
Oh, God, man!
Why did you go in there?

360
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,864
What? Everybody was scared out
of their wits, man.

361
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:50,599
Everyone, okay,
I have an announcement.

362
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,309
Apparently,
in business school,

363
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:57,574
they don't teach you
how to operate a toaster oven,

364
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:02,245
because some smart, sexy temp
left his cheese pita

365
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:05,549
on "oven" instead of timing it
for the toaster thing.

366
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:10,181
Oh, wow, okay.

367
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:15,026
Well, I guess they don't teach how to
operate a toaster oven in business school.

368
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:16,462
That's exactly what I said.

369
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,432
Hey, did you miss
that day, there, Ryan?

370
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:19,490
Were you absent?

371
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:20,694
Toaster Oven 101.

372
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,794
You failed?

373
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,929
I'm so sorry.

374
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,436
Oh, man.

375
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:28,844
"Hey, I know what'll impress
everybody. I'll start a fire. "

376
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:31,072
Oh, man.

377
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:33,980
Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.

378
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,246
I have a song, attention
everyone, that I wanna sing,

379
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,278
that I wrote especially for this occasion
when I was up there among the flames.

380
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:42,617
Ready?

381
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:45,251
Ryan started the fire!

382
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,490
It was always burning since
the world's been turning!

383
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:51,192
Ryan started the fire!
Ryan started the fire!

384
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,428
It was always burning
since the world was turning!

385
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:54,764
Everybody!

386
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,731
I can't believe
I started the fire.

387
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:05,069
Marilyn Monroe!

388
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:07,445
Ryan started the fire!
Ryan started the fire!

389
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,279
It was always burning

390
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,285
Eat it. Yeah, eat it.
You have to eat it.

391
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:12,513
Hey.
Hey.

392
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,748
How are you?
Good. How are you?

393
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:14,915
I'm good.
It's good to see you.

394
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,014
Good to see you, too.

395
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:17,581
I'm hungry.
Yeah, I am, too.

396
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,891
Oh, I have been thinking
the whole way over,

397
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:22,021
and I have my answers.

398
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,121
What answers?

399
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,598
For the "desert island. "

400
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,362
Oh, right! Right, right,
right. Come on, come on.

401
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:29,233
Ladies and gentlemen, gather
around. We have one more participant.

402
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:31,273
Come on, be polite. Be polite.

403
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,968
Hi. Desert island, five movies, go.

404
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:36,671
Okay, first,

405
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
Legally Blonde.

406
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,645
I forgot what
a super-nice girl Katy is.

407
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:48,950
And just good for Jim.
They are so cute together.

408
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,686
And what an adorable car.

409
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:56,929
Okay, I think the game's over.
People are, like, leaving.

410
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,330
There was a bigger crowd
last time.

411
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,833
Do you wanna just go to lunch?
Okay.

412
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:00,960
Yeah?
All right.

413
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:02,060
You wanna drive?
Sure.

414
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,297
All right.

415
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,444
They are so cute.

416
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:14,808
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

417
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,078
Answer me this, though.

418
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:17,846
What?
Was it worth it?

419
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,285
Was it worth it, temp?
No.

420
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:20,413
Was it worth it?
Really?

421
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:21,683
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

422
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:24,225
The fire guy. The fire guy!

423
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,727
Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon
Studebaker, Television

424
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:29,127
North Korea, South Korea,
Marilyn Monroe!

425
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,393
Ryan started the fire!

426
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:34,061
Okay, rule five: Safety first,

427
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:36,969
i. e. Don't burn
the building down.

428
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,200
Okay?
That should be a no-brainer.

429
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:43,541
Oh, look, Ryan is book smart,

430
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:47,679
and I am street smart
and book smart.

431
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:52,350
I'll give you
the rest of the 10 tomorrow.
