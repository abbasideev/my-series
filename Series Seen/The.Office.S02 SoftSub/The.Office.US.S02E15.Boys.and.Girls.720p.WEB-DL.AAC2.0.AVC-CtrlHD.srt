1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,532
So, I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,363
It's very nice
to see all of you.

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:06,798
You're all looking well.

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,342
Today is a "women
in the workplace" thing.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,971
Jan's coming in from Corporate
to talk to all the women about...

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,307
I don't really know what.

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,945
But Michael's not allowed in.
She said that about five times.

8
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,612
Women today, though we have
the same options as men,

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,956
we often face a very
different set of obstacles

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,893
In getting there. So...

11
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,157
Hey, what's going on?
Michael...

12
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,324
Yeah, you know what? I thought
we agreed you wouldn't be here.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,528
I thought about it. I just
have a few things I want to say.

14
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:38,003
What are you doing?
Just hear me out.

15
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,267
What is more important
than quality?

16
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,598
Equality.

17
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:46,408
Now, studies show that today's woman,
the Ally McBeal Woman, as I call her,

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,606
is at a crossroads.

19
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,842
Michael...
And... No, just...

20
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,646
You have come a long way,
baby.

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,313
But I just want to keep
it within reason. Michael.

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,879
They did this up in Albany... You
are not allowed in this session, okay?

23
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,049
...and they ended up turning

24
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,252
the break room into a lactation
room, which is disgusting.

25
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,919
Now you're really not
allowed in this session.

26
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,464
Well, I'm their boss.
I am your boss.

27
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,936
Anybody want any coffee or
anything? We're fine, Michael.

28
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,405
We just need you to leave,
please.

29
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,101
Women
in the workplace.

30
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,137
Yeah. Translation, I have been
banned from my own conference room

31
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,305
so that Jan can talk in
secret to all the girls.

32
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,748
Whoa, sorry.
Women of the workplace.

33
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,080
About what? I don't know.

34
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,949
Clothes. Me.

35
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,617
Ladies, I am so, so sorry.

36
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:35,187
Can we start again?
We were on such a roll.

37
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,354
I really apologize...
Jan?

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,954
...for that. Yes, Pam?

39
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,430
Michael's still at the door. Michael!

40
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,348
So, one obstacle

41
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:17,750
is how assertiveness is perceived
differently in men and women.

42
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:21,121
Men who are assertive tend to
be admired. They're called...

43
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,148
Anyone?

44
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,423
That's a terrible idea.

45
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:26,922
What is?

46
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,861
Them in there all together.

47
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:32,560
They stay in there too long,
they're gonna get on the same cycle.

48
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:35,071
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

49
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:39,039
Everyone? Guys?
Circle up, please.

50
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:41,740
Come on over.
Bring your chairs.

51
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,677
Toby? Come on over.

52
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,875
You're a guy, too. Sort of.

53
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,011
Let's do this!

54
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:53,519
Well, first of all, I just want to
warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.

55
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,284
Let's just clap. Ready?

56
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,752
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

57
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,820
Okay, I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael...

58
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,889
Just having a little
"guys in the workplace" thing.

59
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:07,028
...but it's very disruptive.
Why can't boys play with dolls?

60
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:10,336
Why does society

61
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,671
force us to use urinals,

62
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,176
when sitting down
is far more comfortable?

63
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,837
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?

64
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,972
We have nowhere else, Jan.

65
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,414
This... We could do it in the warehouse.

66
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:22,145
Dwight. Excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

67
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,983
Okay, fine.
Actually, perfect. Perfect.

68
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:29,321
You know what? There is another
side to this place, gentlemen.

69
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:33,193
And I know we all love our cushy
jobs and our fun, exciting office,

70
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:35,391
but do you realize
that underneath us,

71
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,797
there's another world?

72
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,300
The warehouse world.

73
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,829
A world that is teeming with
sweat and dirt and life.

74
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,301
Life.

75
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,440
The bowels of the office.

76
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:51,504
These guys are down there, they
are real men, doing real men's work.

77
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:54,745
We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.

78
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:59,618
I think
this is gonna work out great.

79
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:03,454
Because managing the warehouse is
a very important part of my job,

80
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,688
and I haven't been there
in months.

81
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:32,414
Remember on Lost
when they met The Others?

82
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,859
I am so sorry about that.

83
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:40,955
So, where were we? Pam, are
you okay taking notes, then?

84
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,658
Please?
Yeah.

85
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,132
Thank you very much.

86
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,862
So, let's meet the warehouse!

87
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,733
Let's get some shots.

88
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:50,167
Pan around there.

89
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,643
This is Darryl.
One of our warehouse staff.

90
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,209
Darryl,
what is your biggest fear?

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,305
My biggest fear is that
someone will distract us

92
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,543
from getting all the shipments
out on time. You know what?

93
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:04,349
Darryl is actually the foreman
here, and not Roy, which is cool.

94
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,389
There's Roy,
riding the big rig.

95
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:10,257
So, Roy is actually going to be
marrying Pam sometime this summer.

96
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:12,820
And she's our receptionist.

97
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,727
Sort of a "Brangelina" thing.

98
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:15,958
Why?

99
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:20,433
"Brangelina" is the Brad Pitt
and Angelina. I don't understand.

100
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,735
Roy... Roy and Pam. It's a
"Ram. " It's a "Ram" thing.

101
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:26,469
I bet Roy heard about you
liking Pam.

102
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,738
I bet he'll try
to beat you up.

103
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,047
Thanks for the heads up, Kev.

104
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,217
I got your back, if he does.

105
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,550
But try to stay out of it.

106
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,715
Just in case there's somebody
down here who shouldn't be.

107
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:44,988
A little Good Will Hunting
situation.

108
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,552
All right. Troops.

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,024
This is an important day,
a big day.

110
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:53,630
Now, you may look around

111
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,501
and see two groups here.

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,907
White collar, blue collar.

113
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,603
But I don't see it that way.
And you know why not?

114
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,940
Because I am collar-blind.

115
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:09,148
Why don't we go around the table and all
say something that we know we're good at?

116
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,813
I will start.
I am good at public speaking.

117
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,652
Hi. I'm Meredith,
and I'm an...

118
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,821
Good at supplier relations.

119
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,293
Great! Phyllis?

120
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:20,325
I'm good at computer stuff.

121
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:23,264
E- mails, spreadsheets.
All that.

122
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:24,392
Really?

123
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:25,962
I don't know.
I thought that...

124
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,469
No. Okay. Stop.

125
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:28,800
You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets,

126
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,965
and I almost always... Really?
I thought they were pretty...

127
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,067
I don't know how
I fit in with these women

128
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,044
here, or with Jan.

129
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:39,682
I mean, we get along great.
Fine.

130
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:44,546
I guess the person I have
the most in common with is...

131
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:48,090
Jim Halpert!

132
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,690
Hey, I, you know,

133
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:54,594
heard there's a rumor going around about
you used to have a crush on Pam and...

134
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,292
Oh, no, no.
No, no, it's cool,

135
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,925
'cause I know
you're a good guy,

136
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,196
and I know that that crush
ended a long time ago.

137
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,704
So, you know, we're cool.
All right?

138
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,469
Yeah. No, yeah. Definitely.

139
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,033
You know, it's great with me.
'Cause that way...

140
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,307
I'm glad she has a friend at work
she can get through the day with.

141
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,372
Oh. And then she's not
all "bap, bap, bap, bap,"

142
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,781
you know, when she gets home.
Yeah. I like talking to her, too.

143
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,583
So, we're cool, right?
Yes. Yeah.

144
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,322
Yup. Cool, man.
Good. All right. Sweet.

145
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,724
Hey, Mike, look.
How about we go upstairs, too?

146
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:34,066
You know, learn how an
office works. Oh, well.

147
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,504
We can both switch places
for the day. Okay. Yeah.

148
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:39,041
You know what? I don't...
You... Your...

149
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:40,508
My job sucks compared to this.

150
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,010
I don't think you'd like it
up there. An experience...

151
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,309
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?

152
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:48,011
Okay. Let's go.

153
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,678
Step up.

154
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,152
Check this out.

155
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,950
Look at that. Look at that.

156
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,582
Hello, how are... Okay.

157
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:02,522
That's great.
That is good stuff.

158
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,461
In five years, I'd like
to be five years sober.

159
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,699
That is an excellent goal.

160
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,271
Four and a half.

161
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:11,665
I'll tell you one thing.

162
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:15,610
I am not gonna be one of those women
schlepping her kids around in a minivan.

163
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,737
Great.

164
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:20,078
I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.

165
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,374
That would be great.

166
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,441
I'll be honest.

167
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,818
One of the goals of these women's seminars
is to feel out if there's any standouts,

168
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,824
women who could be a valuable
addition to our corporate life.

169
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,563
Michael wants us to bond, so
we need topics for conversation.

170
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:37,622
Ponies.

171
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:38,725
No.

172
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:39,826
How about rainbows?

173
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,063
No.

174
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,628
Flowers.
No!

175
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,431
That's dangerous, Mike. Come
on, get down off the lift.

176
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:45,975
Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself. Mike!

177
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,238
Stand clear. Mike, get
off of the lift. Please!

178
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,212
Come on, now. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

179
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,376
Look, would you...
Look...

180
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:00,651
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

181
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:03,124
We're the ones
that gotta clean that up!

182
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:05,155
Damn it, Michael!

183
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,891
We have
to have this thing serviced.

184
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,777
So, guys' gripe session.

185
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,210
Here we are.

186
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,983
Now, we definitely live
in different worlds,

187
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,321
but we have a lot in common.

188
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,684
We even like the same girls,
some of us.

189
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,130
And that's gonna happen.
You know, we're guys, so...

190
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,361
Hey, do you want me to go?

191
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,699
No, why would I? You can...

192
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,133
I'll go.
... stay, or...

193
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,667
And a big walk-in closet.

194
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,474
Oh, that's part of my
dream, too. Oh, me, too.

195
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,080
Great. Great.

196
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,612
And, Pam? What about you?
What is your dream?

197
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,488
Well, I always dreamed of a
house with a terrace upstairs.

198
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,190
Plant flowers on it, stuff
like that. Since I was a girl.

199
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,256
More seriously, though,

200
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,223
a husband that I love.

201
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,558
Roy.

202
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,503
And I love to draw.

203
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:07,473
And I did a little in college,
and I'd still love to do something

204
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,805
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

205
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,344
She's real good.
Thanks.

206
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:15,314
You know, the company is offering a
design training program in New York.

207
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,111
Well, I have a job right now.

208
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,153
So, I can't really take time
off. Well, it's only on weekends.

209
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,189
And then a few weeks
in New York,

210
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,986
but I'm sure that I could ask
Corporate to help you out.

211
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,050
Well, it's just that the
weekends aren't good because...

212
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,187
There are always a million
reasons not to do something.

213
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,833
Let's start
with the warehouse.

214
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,337
What bothers you as guys?
You know?

215
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,929
My priority is safety.

216
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:40,996
Okay.

217
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,067
So it really bothers me when somebody
comes in here, speeding around on the lift,

218
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,237
playing with it like a toy.
It kind of gets under my skin.

219
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,905
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,741
Don't shush me.

221
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,614
No, that was just...
That bothers me, too.

222
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,744
I was breathing. Pam shushes
me. It drives me crazy.

223
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,812
I hate shushing.
You know, that's the thing.

224
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,019
What... Okay. What is
our beef, as human men?

225
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:02,890
You know, that's
a good question, Hasselhoff.

226
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,267
Okay. All right.
What bugs us?

227
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,529
Good.
Guys ragging on each other.

228
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:12,470
That's what guys do,
and we love it.

229
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,006
All right.
Let's talk about clothing.

230
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,779
I'm excited about today.
I love girl talk.

231
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,581
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

232
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,085
All right, you can use your clothing
to send a message about your ambitions

233
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,681
by wearing clothes that
reflect what you aspire to be.

234
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,817
I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.

235
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,827
I'm a professional woman,

236
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,328
the head of Accounting.

237
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,957
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

238
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,196
I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.

239
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,870
And apparently,
judging from her outfit,

240
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,169
Jan aspires to be a whore.

241
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,508
I hate it when girls insist on
taking them out to new restaurants

242
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,705
every weekend night,

243
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:56,443
and then they're like, "When
are we gonna go on a date-date?"

244
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,781
I hate that, too!
I hate that, too!

245
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,581
That sucks so hard.
It totally sucks!

246
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,145
Yeah, and then they make you drive
them to church the next morning.

247
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,588
Like, gas ain't free.

248
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,925
Yeah, on our salaries, man.
What do they expect?

249
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,861
You know, "Take us out every
weekend," you know what I mean?

250
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,421
I feel you, man.
We're not millionaires.

251
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,229
I feel you. No, you
don't. You don't feel us.

252
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,497
How can you? You know what?
Not literally.

253
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,629
You say we're the same,

254
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:20,867
but we get compensated
very differently. Yes.

255
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,933
We work the same hours as you, and
you just said we work a lot harder.

256
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,912
You do. So...
But we get paid a lot less.

257
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,106
Word.

258
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,173
Like, next to no benefits.
I know.

259
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,979
God, what is that?
Exactly.

260
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,679
It blows. It blows, man!

261
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,348
You know, this would not
happen if we had a union.

262
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,856
That's what I'm talking about.

263
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,189
Absolutely, that's what we
need to do. You're right.

264
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,455
See, that's what I've been
saying, man.

265
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,723
We need to do this, finally.

266
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,162
You know what,
is that necessary?

267
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,928
'Cause you already, sort of,
have a union of guys.

268
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,765
It's more than necessary,
Mike. We need this.

269
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:51,896
Roy?
Yeah?

270
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,837
Do you still have that card
from the dockworkers' union?

271
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,738
Dockworkers?
In my truck.

272
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,901
Come on, man.
Yeah.

273
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,470
You know what? I think
our problem is the chicks.

274
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,310
The problem is the chicks.
Union! Yeah!

275
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,479
And you gotta blame them.

276
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,354
Are you with us, Mike?
Yeah...

277
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,085
Welcome to the warehouse.

278
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:15,822
Michael! Michael!
Michael! Michael!

279
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,359
Another issue is inequality
of pay between men and women.

280
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:23,329
I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.

281
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,929
This is important.
Ladies, take a breather.

282
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,201
Jan, I

283
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,270
wanted...

284
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,644
Can I help you?

285
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:38,645
I wanted to say that the guys downstairs
are thinking about forming a union,

286
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,220
and they have some good
points. What? A union?

287
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,447
Don't get hysterical.
I'm not.

288
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,389
Part of my job is knowing
how to talk to women.

289
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,119
Let's be rational here.

290
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,494
What are the pros?
What are the cons?

291
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,589
The cons are that everyone will
lose their job, Michael. Everyone.

292
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,600
Office, warehouse...

293
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,833
What do you think
the pros are here?

294
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:02,137
Don't talk to me that way,
please. Just...

295
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,272
They're gonna want
to hear this from you.

296
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,642
You got yourself into this,
Michael, so...

297
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:08,409
We're bonding down there.... you get
yourself out of it. That's too bad.

298
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,815
I just don't want to have to tell them
something they're not gonna want to hear.

299
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,319
Now who's getting hysterical?
Okay. Come on, Jan.

300
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,548
After all we've been
through... Michael, Michael...

301
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,989
We have a history.
We have a history between us.

302
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,220
Michael.
Don't say another word.

303
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,387
Get yourself downstairs.

304
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,762
I'm just saying that we have
something. Okay. Whatever.

305
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:29,898
You know what?

306
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,272
We could get this done a lot quicker
if we formed a type of assembly line.

307
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,969
This here is a "run out
the clock" situation.

308
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,138
Just like upstairs.

309
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,010
Sports metaphors
are one of the ways

310
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,983
women feel left out
of the language of the office.

311
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:48,010
Now, I know this might sound silly,
but many women ask to go over it, so,

312
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,454
"fumble" means...

313
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,581
Mistake.
Slip.

314
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:51,647
Right.

315
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,183
"Par for the course" is a golf
term. It means "right on track. "

316
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,257
"Below par" means "worse. "

317
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,797
Wait. That should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.

318
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,426
What about "second base"?

319
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:05,961
Like, if Michael said he
got to second base with you,

320
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,736
does that mean you, like,
closed a deal? Excuse me?

321
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,709
I mean,
that's a baseball term, right?

322
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:14,578
I don't know what Michael was
talking about. I don't know.

323
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,640
Like, you went to Chili's, and
he got to second base with you.

324
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:18,841
Excuse me.

325
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,910
Kelly, I don't know what
Michael was talking about.

326
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,819
He just told everybody, and I
just want to know if that's...

327
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,915
Hey.
Hey.

328
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,620
How's it going down there?

329
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:30,460
It's a complete... Well, actually,
it's exactly what you'd expect, so...

330
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,089
How are the girls?
Good.

331
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,760
We watched a video
about our changing bodies.

332
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,435
Did you really?
No.

333
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,699
Oh.
Almost.

334
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:42,133
But, hey,
something kind of cool,

335
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:46,042
there's this internship in graphic
design that Jan was telling us about.

336
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,445
She made it sound, like,
really great.

337
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,147
Nice! Well, what's it all
about? I think you should do it.

338
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,820
That's great!
It's really cool.

339
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,557
Cold front
coming into the warehouse!

340
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:03,062
Better put on your ski boots!

341
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,898
Happy New Year, Darryl.

342
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,467
Hey, Darryl.

343
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,742
You ever done this?

344
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,607
Are you married?

345
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,147
I'm divorced.

346
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,580
That must have been hard.

347
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,674
It was, yes.

348
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,276
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,

349
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,787
and that's why you did that
thing with Michael.

350
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,825
I think you should all spend a little
more time thinking about your careers,

351
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,382
and less time
on personal stuff.

352
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,054
I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.

353
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,563
At least
you don't have kids.

354
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,462
You have no kids, right?
Thank God.

355
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,502
Okay. Let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

356
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,201
How can someone
so beautiful be so sad?

357
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:52,936
Hi. Did you take care of the situation?

358
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,471
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I have...

359
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,209
Excuse me. Excuse me....
essentially, yes, I have taken...

360
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,187
I'm told that there has been
some interest in forming a union,

361
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,883
and that Michael supported it.

362
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,516
Obviously,
he's not a friend of yours,

363
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:08,118
because he didn't tell you the
facts. So, let me.

364
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,993
If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,

365
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:13,863
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

366
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,062
They unionized in Pittsfield, and we
all know what happened in Pittsfield.

367
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,800
It will cost each of you a fortune
in legal fees and union dues,

368
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,434
and that will be nothing compared
to the cost of losing your jobs.

369
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,276
So I would think long and hard before
sacrificing your savings and your futures

370
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,248
just to send a message.

371
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:33,116
If you have any further questions,
you can direct them to...

372
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,222
To Michael.

373
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:43,426
Dreams are just that. They're dreams.
They help get you through the day.

374
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,599
Like the thing about the
terrace. It's nice,

375
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,794
but, I don't know,

376
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,394
it was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.

377
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:55,272
The girl in the book has a
terrace outside of her bedroom,

378
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,674
and she planted flowers on it,

379
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,913
and I just loved that.

380
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,072
It just always kind of
stuck with me.

381
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,844
So, you're not doing it.

382
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,417
How did you know?

383
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,182
Why not?

384
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,751
It's just, like...
No big reason.

385
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,426
Just a bunch of little reasons. Come on.

386
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,832
Roy's right. There's no guarantee
it's gonna lead to anything, anyway.

387
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,264
Roy said that?

388
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,160
What? You have something
you want to say?

389
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,632
You gotta take a chance on
something, sometime, Pam.

390
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,206
I mean, do you want to be
a receptionist here, always?

391
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,442
Oh, excuse me,
I'm fine with my choices.

392
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,409
You are?

393
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,284
Yeah.

394
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,518
It's impractical.

395
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,955
I'm not gonna try
to get a house like that.

396
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,054
They don't even make houses
like that in Scranton.

397
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,062
So, I'm never gonna...

398
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:59,165
I'm just gonna put this
over there.

399
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,303
This is not a good idea,
right here.

400
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,469
Easy does it. Okay.

401
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,483
Pizza. Great equalizer.

402
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:20,254
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

403
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,125
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

404
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:25,728
Do black people like pizza?

405
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,807
Hey.

406
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,141
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

407
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,941
Sometimes Jan
can be such a bitch.

408
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,148
Yeah.
Yeah.

409
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,251
Hey, watch it. Watch it.

410
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:50,813
We have a relationship.

411
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,518
Thank you to our hosts.

412
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,053
Hey, Michael!

413
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:55,993
This ain't over.

414
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,829
Excellent.

415
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:09,069
Is it good to be back? Yeah.
I mean, I love the guy stuff,

416
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,839
but to run an office,
you need men and women.

417
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,106
You know why?

418
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,579
Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension

419
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,447
to keep things interesting.

420
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,227
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

421
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,499
Hold, please.

422
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,472
Snow angels. Snow angels.
