1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,436
What?

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,398
- I said, "Are you all right?"
- Yeah, I'm fine.

3
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:26,278
Maybe you should talk to your
sister. It's an important decision.

4
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,196
- My sister?
- Yes.

5
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:31,491
- Mark?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:33,493
Are you sure you're okay?

7
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:37,747
Yes. I'm sorry, I just... I
got a little woozy and then...

8
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:40,792
I'm gonna stop by the bathroom.

9
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,629
Uh-uh. I think
it's the other way.

10
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,552
Right.

11
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,559
I don't know if I hate
senators or congressmen more.

12
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:43,021
How many of those have you had?

13
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,648
Just this one.

14
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:48,068
Good. We need you nimble. We gotta
get down there. You're on in 20.

15
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,030
I was on with the Board earlier.
They're really grateful for this.

16
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,200
- Gabby.
- Natalie, hello.

17
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:56,826
Hi.

18
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:00,789
Gabby, this is Helena Eagan.

19
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:06,044
My gosh. Helena, so good
to finally meet you.

20
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,588
Likewise.

21
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,173
This better be
working, assholes.

22
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:35,694
Where am I?

23
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,364
Where am I?

24
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,831
Mark. You okay, milady?

25
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,043
So Rebeck smells weird.

26
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,296
Rebeck smells weird?

27
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,340
Yeah, she was making chewing
noises, but she was not chewing.

28
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,427
Just be prepared 'cause you might
have to share a book with her.

29
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,970
A book, right.

30
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,115
The one you forgot to bring
even though I did remind you.

31
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,600
Right. Yeah, I'm sure... Sorry.

32
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,476
That's okay.

33
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,561
Okay.

34
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,772
Okay.

35
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:14,065
How's our baby?

36
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:19,029
Our... I'm gonna assume you mean that
in the "it takes a village" sense.

37
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,614
And she's good. She's hungry.

38
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:25,201
I wanna have the life change talk.
I just need to pump before I die.

39
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,412
- I'll be really fast. Okay.
- Okay.

40
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,001
Hey. Hi. Hi.

41
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,764
"Radar."

42
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,350
What's the thesis?

43
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,686
I agree. It's very confused.

44
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,187
Mark, hello.

45
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,774
Hey, guys. What's up?

46
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:38,984
- Patton, no.
- Mark,

47
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,653
we were just discussing whether
it might have been a wiser move

48
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:45,365
for your sister to put off introducing
the child until after tonight's event.

49
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,242
Mark, you don't have
to weigh in on that.

50
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:51,204
- Obviously the child is an absolute angel.
- Wait... That's my sister? With the baby?

51
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:53,248
Exactly, it's his sister.

52
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,916
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

53
00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,045
Well, that was awkward.

54
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:05,176
Okay, so my sister has the
baby. And Cobel is here?

55
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,307
I've been asked to
share my book with you.

56
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,143
So I've heard. Rebecca?

57
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:16,730
Rebeck. I have small eyes, so
I have to read pretty close.

58
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,814
Okay. Well, I'm...

59
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm sure that'll be fine.
If you'll excuse me?

60
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,444
And I have some sores on the
back of my head from my bird.

61
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,778
- You might see them.
- Okay.

62
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,197
Hey.

63
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,533
Hello, Mark.

64
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:33,622
I pumped, so it's Miller time. Okay,
so life change. What's happening?

65
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:39,252
We're, this is
gonna sound weird…

66
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,131
We're close, you and I?

67
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,468
What do you... What's going on?

68
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,720
Can we talk privately?

69
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,640
- I just have to...
- Okay, my dearest ones,

70
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:52,891
we are nearing that hour,

71
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,393
so if you'd all peacefully
waft in the living room…

72
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:57,317
Okay. Let's talk at the
first reflection break.

73
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:58,355
- Okay?
- Okay.

74
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,265
You just don't realize how much
kids are gonna change your life.

75
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,600
But they do.

76
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,395
- How many kids do you have?
- Just gave birth to my third.

77
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,313
I should've stopped at two.

78
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,441
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

79
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:45,777
- Angelo, great to see you.
- You too.

80
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,281
Helena, this is my
husband, Angelo Arteta.

81
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:51,533
Helena, nice to meet you.

82
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,784
I've gotta hop backstage.

83
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,053
- I'll see you in a second.
- Okay.

84
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:55,579
Lovely to see you, Natalie.

85
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,541
- You okay?
- She couldn't find the bottle.

86
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,502
Wow. Three kids.

87
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,588
Couldn't have done it
without a little help.

88
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:09,009
I mean, the idea that people
would want to outlaw severance.

89
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,387
I know.

90
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:34,159
The photo display
is very moving.

91
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:38,204
I already knew how I'd
be voting, but I think...

92
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:42,167
Well, seeing that and seeing you
and hearing what you have to say,

93
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,502
all of this could really
make a difference.

94
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,505
I hope so.

95
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,925
Let's change some minds.

96
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:52,844
Well, I'm certainly gonna try.

97
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:54,846
Thank you.

98
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,725
And please thank your
father if you see him.

99
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,313
I will.

100
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,160
Mark. Come here.

101
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:20,247
Saved us a seat.

102
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,170
I just have to find my glasses.

103
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,507
Mark, can you just hold that

104
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,590
- for a second?
- Yeah.

105
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,393
Oh, my God.

106
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:46,439
Sorry, you can't unring

107
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:50,694
the bell-ringing app apparently.

108
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:55,323
Okay. Thank you
all for being here.

109
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,243
Before we start,
there is one person

110
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:01,037
that I would like to
thank first and foremost.

111
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:06,001
Family is both my bedrock
and my inspiration.

112
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:10,589
So I dedicate the reading
to my firstborn daughter,

113
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:11,756
who is here tonight.

114
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,134
Eleanor, I love you.

115
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,767
My brother-in-law.

116
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:26,187
And with that… I begin.

117
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,902
"It's said that as a child,

118
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:36,907
Wolfgang Mozart killed another boy
by slamming his head in a piano.

119
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,618
Don't worry.

120
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,662
My research for this book
has proven the claim untrue.

121
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,665
As your heart rate
settles though,

122
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:48,168
- "consider the power an author…"
- Mark.

123
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,879
Can I look at her book too?

124
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,005
I can crane.

125
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,090
- "…can hold over a reader…"
- Sure.

126
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:57,344
"…heretofore called 'you.'

127
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:02,849
But what, indeed, is 'you'?"

128
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,934
Good luck tonight.

129
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,644
It was great to
meet you, Helena.

130
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,064
"How can 'you' mean
different things

131
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:12,067
to millions of readers
around a vast Earth?

132
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:18,531
"And perhaps, most
importantly, who are you?"

133
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,918
"All creatures,
from the leaping cat

134
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,586
to the cowering shrew,

135
00:13:54,669 --> 00:14:00,425
think of themselves as 'you, ' a
logical center for the universe.

136
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:04,888
Yet the cat eats the shrew,
and we, like Schrödinger,

137
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,933
"live on to wonder
what it means."

138
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:09,976
End of chapter.

139
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,107
Let's all take a

140
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:19,402
seven-minute reflection
break and then come back.

141
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,240
Balf. Prepare the neti pot.

142
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:24,741
It was transformative.

143
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,369
I'm gonna have to
change my name again.

144
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,456
What a wordsmith. He seemed to have
a little something in his throat.

145
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,166
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

146
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,890
I'm gonna see if she'll
have more bottle.

147
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,729
Give me a couple of minutes,
then meet me in the baby room?

148
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:37,754
- Okay.
- Okay.

149
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:43,343
Excuse me.

150
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:55,689
Mr. Hale... Ricken?

151
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,276
I don't know why my
voice shakes like that.

152
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:02,529
I sound like a sad
old hamburger waiter

153
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:05,282
prattling on about sauces.

154
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,659
"Hamburger waiter."
What the fuck is that?

155
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,370
Jesus, why do I ever
open my buffoon mouth?

156
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:11,371
It's going great.

157
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:14,541
- I mean, the book is brilliant, and...
- Okay, Mark.

158
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,185
Thank you, but you
don't have to say that.

159
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,044
I'm well aware of how
I come across to you.

160
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:20,338
What? No, I mean it.

161
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:23,466
The... Your book, it... It
opened up the world for me.

162
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:26,887
Mark, are you okay?

163
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,974
Yes. This book
changed my whole life.

164
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,518
You actually read it?

165
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:36,021
Ricken, are we friends?

166
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,609
Look, I know I sometimes
make you feel "less than"

167
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,944
for having had the procedure.

168
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:44,154
And I regret that.

169
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:47,908
You had to deal with Gemma's passing
in a way that was best for you.

170
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:52,829
You know, I was scrolling through
old pictures this morning,

171
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:56,750
and I found one of the four
of us on the crest hike.

172
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,629
- You remember the funny bees?
- Do you have that on you? The picture?

173
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:04,049
Yeah, sure. I should.

174
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:07,636
- Ricken. The neti pot is warm.
- Thank you, Balf.

175
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,804
Mark, I need to
flush my sinuses.

176
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:13,016
But thank you. You have no idea
how much this has meant to me.

177
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:26,071
Mark, I was worried about you.

178
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:27,656
I'm fine. Thanks.

179
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,908
I'm just going to
check on my sister.

180
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,247
When you hugged me before, you
suddenly became tense. What was that?

181
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:38,291
I didn't know I did.

182
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,086
Well, you did. You're tense now.

183
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,297
Yeah, sorry, it's just parties.

184
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,883
Did you mean what
you said before?

185
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,094
About your plans.

186
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,347
Of course.

187
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:55,100
Tell me more.

188
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:02,482
You know, I'm so sorry. I'm just...
I'm on uncle duty for my sister.

189
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,109
So I'll be right back.

190
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,694
- Okay?
- Okay.

191
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,071
Okay. Thanks, Ms. Cobel.

192
00:17:57,412 --> 00:18:00,415
- I know. Hey, there you are.
- Hey, I really need to talk to you.

193
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,810
No, I know. I just have to deal
with her. She's having a meltdown.

194
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:04,127
But just meet me in there, okay?

195
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:07,214
- Okay, I'll just... Wait. Okay.
- I promise I'll be back.

196
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,056
Thank God, Mrs. Selvig. Hi.

197
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,141
Can you take her for a
sec while I talk to Mark?

198
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,268
- Of course, love.
- Thank you.

199
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,103
- Is Mark all right?
- Yeah, he's fine.

200
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,438
Thank you, you're an angel.

201
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:38,411
Okay… I'm all yours.

202
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:53,510
My name is Helena,
and I'm an Eagan.

203
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,300
So one of the things you
learn growing up as an Eagan

204
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:59,391
is that the workers
are our family.

205
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:01,434
And I remember being
confused about that as a kid,

206
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:02,537
because I thought that meant

207
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,980
I had a few hundred thousand
literal brothers and sisters

208
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:07,399
scattered around the world.

209
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:08,608
Oh, my God.

210
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:12,445
But as I grew older, I learned
that it's about shared ideals.

211
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,616
My dad used to make me recite
the nine core principles

212
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,867
before bed every night,

213
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:20,787
which I can't say I always
did happily. Sorry, Dad.

214
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,000
But those are now the values that I
share with everyone who works at Lumon,

215
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,335
and that's what
makes them my family.

216
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:30,422
And I would never ever
ask them to do anything

217
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,425
that I'm not willing or
excited to do myself.

218
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:36,720
Look, my dad would
love for me to sit here

219
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:39,306
and say that I'm taking
this job out of loyalty

220
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:44,060
and that it was the spirit of
pure Eagan calling me to service.

221
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:49,733
But I took a severed job because
it sounds freaking awesome.

222
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,903
So, no, I don't think
severance divides us.

223
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:55,238
I think it brings us together.

224
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:15,508
Greetings.

225
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:18,595
- I'm not here right now.
- Goddamn it, Milchick!

226
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:12,083
Helena.

227
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:13,960
She's in here, sir.

228
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,222
Helena.

229
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:29,768
You look so nice.

230
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:33,688
Like a film.

231
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:37,609
Thank you.

232
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:42,489
Are you…

233
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:46,368
Are you still in pain?

234
00:22:48,787 --> 00:22:49,788
I'm not.

235
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:51,998
Not anymore.

236
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:02,175
I cried in my bed when they told
me what she tried to do to you.

237
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,887
What that innie
tried to do. I...

238
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:11,601
Thank you for going
through with this.

239
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,522
The Grandfather would
cherish what you've done.

240
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,486
And one day you will sit
with me at my revolving.

241
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,366
Are you feeling well?

242
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:28,868
Yeah.

243
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:33,790
I think, I think the drink
just hit me a little bit.

244
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,377
You'll be all right
for the speech?

245
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:41,548
For my speech. Yeah. Of course.

246
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:48,138
Do you remember when I brought
home the first chip to show you?

247
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,683
The prototype.

248
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:56,229
It had the blue and
green lights back then.

249
00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,107
Yeah.

250
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:04,946
I remember you said to me,
"It's so pretty, Daddy."

251
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:09,242
"Everybody in the whole
world should get one."

252
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:12,746
They will.

253
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:16,583
Because of you.

254
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:22,047
They'll all be Kier's children.

255
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,054
Mr. Eagan. Helena. It's
time to head to stage.

256
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,458
Forgive me for the harm
I've caused this world.

257
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:05,799
None may atone for
my actions… but me.

258
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:13,348
And only in me shall
their stain live on.

259
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,895
All I can be is sorry.

260
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,274
And that is all I am.

261
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:08,296
You swear you're
not fucking with me?

262
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,048
I swear.

263
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,051
This is so insane.

264
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,971
They need to send people down to
check every inch of that place.

265
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:19,558
Like, inspectors or whatever.
Is that a thing? Inspectors?

266
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:21,184
Yeah. There are inspectors.

267
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,895
Mark has b... I mean, out here,

268
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:27,566
you have been trying to figure
out what Lumon does. What you do.

269
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:28,650
Okay.

270
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:32,612
I just…

271
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:36,741
I just want to know why.

272
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,370
Why he put me in there.

273
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,127
He lost his wife.

274
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:51,214
You lost your wife. A little
before you started at Lumon.

275
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,009
Gemma.

276
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,348
It was a car accident, and, at
first, you tried to keep teaching.

277
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:03,018
I was a teacher?

278
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:05,520
A professor. Of history.

279
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:09,441
You tried to go back to teaching
three weeks after she died,

280
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:12,611
and it was a disaster.

281
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,907
She was just still in
your veins, you know?

282
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:18,575
Making everything hurt.

283
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,205
Which is why I guess you
thought the severed job would...

284
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,002
He hoped you'd be
spared from the pain.

285
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:39,679
It's a nice name. Gemma.

286
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:44,517
Yeah.

287
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:48,813
We were all really
close. It was great.

288
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:51,900
She was wonderful.

289
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,611
She made you wonderful.

290
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,703
They told me not to talk to you.

291
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:49,374
The goddamn OTC's been triggered!
Mark S. Is his fucking innie!

292
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:50,584
What? That's not possible.

293
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:55,046
It's Dylan. They've been
plotting this all along.

294
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,339
Helly's at the gala.

295
00:29:56,423 --> 00:30:00,260
I'll take care of Helly. I'll
fix it like I fix everything.

296
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:04,681
Get to the security office,
and shut it off now!

297
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:06,182
Shit!

298
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,287
Goddamn it! Dylan!

299
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:28,787
Dylan!

300
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:31,708
I know you're in there,
Dylan. Open the door!

301
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,877
Fuck you, Mr. Milchick!

302
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:37,047
Dylan! Dylan!

303
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:40,985
Ricken knows a lot of high-end
journalists in New York.

304
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,094
And you think that's
better than the police?

305
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:45,722
Well, Lumon has their
hands in so many pies.

306
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,390
Sorry, do you
understand metaphor?

307
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:49,226
Yeah, hands in pies. I get it.

308
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:51,603
I think we have to be really
careful about who we talk to.

309
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,480
- Okay.
- How much time do you have?

310
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:55,232
I don't know. Maybe an hour?

311
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:57,484
Right. Because once
your bosses find out…

312
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:01,404
Jesus, I totally forgot.
Cobel! Why is Cobel here?

313
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:02,697
What?

314
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:05,533
My boss from Lumon. Ms.
Cobel. She's at this party.

315
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:06,743
What are you talking about?

316
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:08,787
I mean, she's dressed different.

317
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,873
Kind of a flowy, purple
outfit, silver hair.

318
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,085
Mark, are you talking
about Mrs. Selvig?

319
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:17,921
Maybe, but her name
is Harmony Cobel.

320
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:20,090
And she works at Lumon?

321
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,299
Yeah, she's my boss.

322
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:22,551
Jesus fucking Christ.

323
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:51,830
Dylan.

324
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,206
Why are you doing this, man?

325
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,041
Come on.

326
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:58,837
You are the refiner
of the quarter!

327
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,673
"While most cultures
view sex as ugly or foul,

328
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,317
- "I've always seen it..."
- Mrs. Selvig?

329
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:05,027
- What?
- Is she there? Is Mrs. Selvig there?

330
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:05,886
- Do you...
- What?

331
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,012
Mrs. Selvig?

332
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:09,014
- What is going on?
- She has Eleanor!

333
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:12,309
What? Excuse me a moment, okay.

334
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,769
Honey? What did you say?

335
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:17,772
Mrs. Selvig has Eleanor.
Did you see her?

336
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:22,110
- Oh, my God.
- What is going on?

337
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:23,945
Oh, my God. Her car's gone.

338
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,364
I gave her the
baby, and she left!

339
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,200
- She left? With Eleanor?
- I handed her the baby,

340
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,285
and she left!

341
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:32,287
- Have we looked everywhere?
- Not yet!

342
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,830
Okay, let's go inside and look.

343
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:34,914
Oh, my God!

344
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:02,275
I bet the tempers
were disappointed.

345
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,110
I can still get
you back in there.

346
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:06,321
I can get you any
perk you want, Dylan.

347
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:09,241
Hey, there's stuff you
don't even know about.

348
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:12,953
There's paintball,
there's coffee cozies.

349
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:14,287
Dylan, come on!

350
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:18,541
Just say the word, and I'll get you a
coffee cozy literally right now, Dylan.

351
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,668
Come on, man!

352
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:23,421
I wanna remember my
fucking kid being born!

353
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,259
You have two others.

354
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:29,678
I can tell you about 'em.

355
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:32,657
Open the door, and I'll
tell you their names.

356
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:33,681
Come on, Dylan.

357
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:36,393
Dylan!

358
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,135
It's rolling.

359
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,890
My name is Helena,
and I'm an Eagan.

360
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:20,144
So one of the things you learn growing
up as an Eagan is that the workers…

361
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,148
- We start in two minutes.
- Thanks.

362
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:24,231
Good luck.

363
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:28,695
I'll tee you up. Just stick
to the talking points.

364
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:31,698
Use the line about how you
see your innie as your sister.

365
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,617
- They'll love that.
- Got it.

366
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:35,660
It's gonna be great.

367
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:22,624
She's not in the baby room.

368
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,918
Have all these
rooms been checked?

369
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:29,089
Thank God.

370
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:30,674
Devon! I got her!

371
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:34,302
Devon, she's here! I found her.

372
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:35,804
I found your child.

373
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:39,182
I'm the one who found her!

374
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:52,904
Dylan!

375
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:56,366
Dylan!

376
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:57,617
…Improvements in morale,

377
00:35:57,701 --> 00:35:59,578
a happier workplace.

378
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,457
As with any transformative
technology, there have been setbacks.

379
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,667
Bumps in the road.

380
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,046
But I'm here tonight to tell you that
we are on the verge of a revolution.

381
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,465
A kind and empathetic revolution

382
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:13,967
that puts the human being…

383
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,596
- Oh, my God!
- Is it you?

384
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:21,182
What are you talking about?

385
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:24,686
It is you, isn't it?

386
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:29,065
I'm gonna kill your company.

387
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,651
Your company!

388
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:35,155
Who the hell do
you think you are?

389
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:38,199
No. Your friends
are gonna suffer.

390
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,411
Mark will suffer.

391
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:43,580
You'll be long gone,

392
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:49,085
but we will keep
them alive, in pain.

393
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:50,837
You're on.

394
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:53,256
…decided that we
could do better.

395
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,551
He may never have seen a
severance chip in his lifetime,

396
00:36:56,635 --> 00:37:01,348
but it represents his gentle and
elegant vision made manifest.

397
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:04,684
But why don't we hear from someone who
can tell us all about it firsthand?

398
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:09,356
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor,

399
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,607
Helena Eagan.

400
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:19,658
Thank you, Natalie.

401
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:51,481
Devon!

402
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:57,279
My name is Helly R.

403
00:37:58,822 --> 00:38:00,073
I'm an innie.

404
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,661
And everything they've told
you about severance is a lie!

405
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:05,745
Devon!

406
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:09,916
Burt!

407
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,377
Burt!

408
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,755
No, no, no. Listen, we're
not happy. We're miserable.

409
00:38:17,173 --> 00:38:18,633
Burt!

410
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:23,430
They torture us down there!

411
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:25,348
Burt!

412
00:38:25,432 --> 00:38:27,893
Devon! Please!

413
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:30,103
We're prisoners!

414
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,273
She's alive!

415
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:36,318
Burt!
