00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:50,135
‐ What's that?

537
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,470

you're good enough.

‐ Well, good luck.
‐ You, too.

586
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,288
‐ Hey, it's not that!

587
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,665
‐ It looks like that.

588
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,794
‐ It's a different kind
of that.

589
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,295
‐ That is that.

590
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,965
‐ It's that without the that.

591
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,053
‐ Why should I believe anything
that comes out of your mouth?

592
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,805
‐ Because I'm not lying.

593
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,556
‐ I called
the mini‐mart after you left.

594
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,020
‐ What?
‐ Where were you?

595
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,565
‐ Not where you think.

596
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,651
‐ 'Cause I think
you were humping your shrink.

597
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,944
‐ Jesus.

598
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,658
I was at
a GED prep class, okay?

599
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,954
‐ For real?

600
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,708
‐ Yeah.

601
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,964
I just‐‐

602
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,632
I didn't want to tell you.

603
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,843
‐ Why?

604
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,637
‐ In case I failed again.

605
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,141
‐ How'd you do?

606
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,981
Come on, creeper in 4A.

607
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,109
‐ Ugh, he has really
got to upgrade.

608
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,696
‐ It's loading.
‐ Oh, my God.

609
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,947
I can't look.
I can't look.

610
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,365
‐ I got this.

611
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,662
Oh, no.

612
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,086
Now we both
have to pay for college.

613
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,550
‐ Ah!

614
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,386
‐ Hey.

615
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,971
Rise and shine.

616
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,060
‐ You just getting home?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

617
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,729
Got my cut.

618
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,485
‐ For real?
‐ Did everything you said.

619
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,364
‐ How much?
‐ Even more than I asked for.

620
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,075
‐ How much?

621
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,537
‐ Depends on how many I sell.

622
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,249
‐ Why you?

623
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,544
‐ He didn't know any women
who could afford a real one.

624
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,756
‐ And we do?

625
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,717
‐

626
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,469
We're gonna have
to find 'em.

627
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,433
‐ They look legit though.

628
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,435
‐ You see the hardware?

629
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:38,978
‐ Mm‐hmm.

630
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,067
‐ Sorry about this,

631
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,277
my gaily colored
beach ball of rapture.

632
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,071
‐ Actually, this look
is very popular...

633
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,614
‐ You guys,
please turn that down.

634
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,616
You're gonna go deaf.
‐ Earthworm Jim!

635
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,618
‐ Dean?
‐ Prepare to be unsuited‐‐

636
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,662
‐ Earth to Dean.

637
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,500
‐ Oh, sorry.

638
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,460
I was just spaced.

639
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,587
‐ Weren't you gonna go
on a bike ride?

640
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,466
‐ Can't.
‐ Didn't you fix the tires?

641
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,801
‐

642
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,053
I have a radius of three blocks
with this thing.

643
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,429
‐ Well, why don't you
just go up and down

644
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,764
the driveway like Jane?

645
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,062
It was a joke.

646
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,522
You guys, TV.

647
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,818
‐ Might as well
just throw me back in.

648
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,988
‐ Because you can't go
on a bike ride?

649
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,156
‐ Because you gave 'em
enough evidence to put me away

650
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,992
for as long as they want.

651
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,874
‐ I'll ask him
to increase the radius.

652
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,085
‐ There is gonna be a trial.
‐ There's not gonna be a trial.

653
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,670
‐ They're not
gonna cut me a deal.

654
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,714
‐ You won't need one.
