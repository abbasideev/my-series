1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,744
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,137
- A few weeks ago

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,443
that thing with
the bank truck burning up,

5
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:09,705
crazy how much it cost me.

6
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:10,706
- Can't do another one.

7
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:11,837
I have a wife.

8
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,014
- Oh, the bitch
who stole my money?

9
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,450
- Convince women
these are real,

10
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:16,886
you get ten times the money.

11
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,496
He didn't know any women
who could afford a real one.

12
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,410
- And we do?

13
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,890
- We might have to find them.

14
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,283
- We could send him to private
school, St. Anne's.

15
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:23,762
- Did you see the game?

16
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:26,156
- Dude, you were so good.
You scored, like, 20 goals.

17
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,505
- I at least want
my husband out.

18
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:28,941
- Not until we know
where the money goes.

19
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,074
- I made a deal to get you out.

20
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:32,510
[gate buzzes]

21
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:34,121
- What did he make
you do this time?

22
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:35,252
- It's not him.

23
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,949
- Do you want this over or not?

24
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:38,125
- What if he finds it?

25
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,865
- Improvise.

26
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,346
- Grandma loves Grisham.

27
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:53,270
- Let me ask you all something.

28
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:59,276
What are we doing here?

29
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:07,806
- Like, right now?

30
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,722
- I mean this operation.

31
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,162
- Yes, you.

32
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:17,077
- Trying to

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,513
get the bad guy.

34
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:21,211
- Ah, how?

35
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:23,300
- Yes, yes, go ahead.

36
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,128
- By following the money.

37
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:28,566
- And what would get
in the way of that?

38
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,222
- Um...

39
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,920
- If you don't...

40
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,139
what?

41
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:37,923
- We don't...

42
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,621
- If you don't--

43
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:42,145
- Show up on time.

44
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,191
- 'Cause today we got here
before you did.

45
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:45,975
- No, no, uh-uh.

46
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,108
If you don't

47
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,458
tell us...

48
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,767
that you're
screwing the target.

49
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,031
- [gasps]

50
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,207
Yeah!

51
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,947
Why didn't you tell us?

52
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,472
- Um, because I'm not?

53
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,735
- Your wire would disagree.

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,175
- Okay.

55
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,743
I'm not screwing anyone,
all right?

56
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,179
- Except your friends

57
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,138
if you want to keep this deal.

58
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,183
- You did it
with him again, dude?

59
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,271
- Not it.

60
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,447
- Then what?

61
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,145
- You know, the other thing.

62
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,712
- Did it involve your vagina?

63
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:28,844
- Sort of.

64
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,499
- And his penis?

65
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,978
- No.

66
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,980
- So his hm?

67
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,808
- No.

68
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,463
- So his huh.

69
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,900
- Okay, I was trying to
distract him.

70
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,902
- By trapping his fingers?

71
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,122
- Because he was going
to see your wire.

72
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,341
- Unbelievable.

73
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,995
- In his abuelita'shouse.

74
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,650
- I really don't care
how many bases you rounded.

75
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,348
- They just call her grandma.

76
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,306
- Oh, the boss, right?

77
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,655
- How was I supposed to know?

78
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,614
- Now we're right back
where we started.

79
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,876
- None of this is my fault.

80
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,921
- Okay, just what are we
supposed to do now?

81
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,272
- 'Cause, like,
we really need this deal.

82
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,317
- You are back on the bench.

83
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,798
One of you two
will have to pinch-hit.

84
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:12,409
- Now I'm getting confused
because the baseball stuff

85
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,716
is blurring with
the sexy stuff and...

86
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,198
- No part of that man
is getting any of this.

87
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,030
- Her wire's still hot.

88
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,423
- Anything good?

89
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,209
- Well, Grandma loves
"Two and a Half Men."

90
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,819
She's totally sick of CPK,

91
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,256
and her foot doctor
appointment's on Tuesday.

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,258
- What about our guy?

93
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,913
- Oh, he's gonna need her.

94
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,701
- Just don't ask me
to wear a wire again.

95
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,705
- What were you
guys talking about?

96
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:58,020
- Hey.

97
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:01,066
Little Money wants me to cut
the crusts off now.

98
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,286
- You thought about how we're
gonna sell these things?

99
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,549
- Ask me, it's the best part.

100
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,291
- All right. Check this.

101
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,470
- Hm, that's swank.

102
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,820
- Four bedrooms,
open floor plan,

103
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,387
mad curb appeal.

104
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,736
- Yeah, who's staying there?

105
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,911
- We are.

106
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,261
It's right by Harry's school.
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,001
- With all those rich moms,

108
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,873
it's the kind of place
you buy a top-notch purse.

109
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,701
- Yeah, if you got
two Gs a night.

110
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,311
- One of the girls
at the salons

111
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,921
cleans these pads
in-between guests.

112
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,314
- Well, won't they know that
we don't live there?

113
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,750
- Not if we say we do.

114
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,057
- Nah, I can't fake
that kind of money.

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,059
- All these bitches
care about are their houses,

116
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,887
their charities,
and what everyone else has.

117
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,454
- Exactly.

118
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,717
- Okay, you can
just be my arm candy.

119
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,547
Hey, it's your ass on the line.

120
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,946
- Beth can't be a part of this.
- Okay.

121
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,296
- I mean, she makes everything
about her.

122
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,645
- You're right.

123
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,907
- No, I don't think you're
hearing what I'm saying.

124
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,256
- I am.
- She does whatever she wants,

125
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,562
whenever she wants.
- I know.

126
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,737
- And the rules don't
ever apply.

127
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,216
- You're right.
- Next thing you know,

128
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,479
you got a bullet in your other
knee, I'm back in jail--

129
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:08,786
- And she's living large.
- Yes.

130
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,136
She can't even hear about this.

131
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,834
- I agree.

132
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,142
- You know I'm talking about
Beth Boland, right?

133
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,274
- Yup.
- Your homie.

134
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,145
- Got it.

135
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,495
- Really?

136
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,758
- She doesn't tell me
everything she does.

137
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,238
- Huh.

138
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,371
Okay.

139
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,460
Good.

140
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,462
- They were out of Windex.

141
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,512
- That boy's onto something.

142
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,775
That's good as hell.

143
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,995
- Oh, no.

144
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,127
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,433
- Mugs?

146
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,999
- Sit down.

147
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,653
- I was really hoping
for more of

148
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,699
a to-go kind of
coffee situation.

149
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,311
[sighs]

150
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,573
Just, uh,

151
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,401
just lay it on me, bruh.

152
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,232
- You were right.

153
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,103
- Hm, exciting.
About what?

154
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,369
- I want to pull Ben out
of St. Anne's.

155
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,066
- Wait, what?

156
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,547
- I don't want him to
turn into a rich dick.

157
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,244
- But you wanted him to
go in the first place.

158
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:16,637
- Well, I changed
my mind, okay?

159
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,073
- What, now that he
has friends?

160
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,422
- This place is evil.

161
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,989
- He has teachers
that love him.

162
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,599
- His teachers will love
him in public school.

163
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:23,905
- But what about lacrosse?

164
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,776
- He can play
lacrosse anywhere.

165
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,648
- They just got
into the playoffs.

166
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:28,953
- It's fine, all right, fine,

167
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,782
but you deal with all
the birthday stuff.

168
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,697
- What does that have to do
with anything?

169
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,091
- You remember Keeley Shukert's
birthday last weekend?

170
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,006
- The Swifty karaoke?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

171
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,703
Well, it turns out that it
wasn't a themed party.

172
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,401
Taylor Swift
actually showed up.

173
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,186
- Taylor Swift came to
a 14-year-old's birthday party?

174
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,755
- Yeah, and she played
the whole "1989" album.

175
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,105
- Did she do
"Out of the Woods?"

176
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,585
- The whole album.
- What about "Clean"?

177
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,848
- The whole "1989" album, okay?

178
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,676
All of it.
Every single song.

179
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,068
And then she stayed
and ate cake.

180
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,592

00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,335
- Tomorrow.

541
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:56,163
Noon. Your bank.

542
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,078
Send all the details.

543
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:00,384
I wouldn't drink that,
by the way.

544
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:01,864
- Why not?

545
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,214
- It expired a week ago.

546
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,437
- That's it.

547
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,699
It's over.

548
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,267
- We got him, right?

549
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,270
- No, he got us.

550
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,272
- He just laid it all out.

551
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:19,839
- That was practically
a confession.

552
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,405
- I found this place
ten minutes

553
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,537
before you guys got here.

554
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,582
- You didn't have
time to wire it?

555
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,409
- I barely had time
to text you.

556
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,456
- [sighs]
Oh, God.

557
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,197
- So it's not over.

558
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,590
- Excuse me.

559
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,026
- Is it safe?

560
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,899
- Oh, yes, I am so
sorry about that.

561
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:40,337
Everyone, meet Irene and Phil.

562

Your country thanks you

You have a very lovely home.

565
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,823
My aunt in Nantucket--

566
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:50,347
.

567
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:53,263
- Dang,
it's archway after archway.

568
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,571
Are you kidding me?

569
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,660
It's like the damn Taj Mahal

570
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,880
if it had two ovens.

571
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,667
Turkey in one,
mac and cheese in the other.

572
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,627
Change the whole
Thanksgiving game.

573
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,283
How'd we do?

574
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,503
- You mean how did I do?

575
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,637
- I had a situation.

576
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,206
- Do you know how hard it is

577
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,730
to pretend you're
someone you're not?

578
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,689
- Every day.

579
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:30,518
- Yeah, well, I'm not
used to having two ovens

580
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,302

581

- They got two dishwashers?

582
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,262
- Two fridges, too.

583
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,133
- Dang.

584
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,396
- Your pal, Michelle,

585
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,399
she was asking me who our
interior designer was.

586
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,706
- What did you say?

587
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,621
- Jovann.

588
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:48,667
- Who the hell's that?

589
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,147
- That cologne you
gave me for Christmas.

590
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,366
You threw me to the wolves.

591
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,194
- It was a situation.

592
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,586
- So, what,
yours is worse than mine?

593
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,849
- The life and death kind.

594
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:59,678
- Or is it because
she always comes first?

595
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:07,903
- Well, it looks like you
did just fine on your own.

596
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:09,992
- Well, I'm short.

597
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,341
- How?

598
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,737
- Didn't sell enough.
Priced them too high.

599
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,391
- Well,

600
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:20,220
we'll have another party.

601
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,352
- Well, then what am
I supposed to tell Gene?

602
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,572
- That it's coming.

603
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,401
- Well, and that might
put me in a situation.

604
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,709
Life and death kind.

605
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,544
- Is that caribou?

606
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:43,373
- Two of everything.

607
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:49,771
[door opens]

608
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,513
- Hey. Soft serve.

609
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,257
- So not fair.

610
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,998
- Well, pardonnez moi,

611
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,652
we are out of foie gras.

612
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,698
- It's about school.

613
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,004
- Oh, you know,
it's funny.

614
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,006
I actually wanted to
talk to you about that.

615
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,008
Um...

616
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:11,750
- Dad won't let me go to D.C.

617
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,012
- Why?

618
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,448
- He says you don't
actually learn anything.

619
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:15,884
It's just a giant party.

620
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,190
- Well, duh, yeah.

621
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,582
That's, like,
why field trips were invented.

622
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,019
- I will literally
be the only one

623
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:21,411
in my grade not going.

624
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:22,543
- Okay, and?

625
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,198
- And I want to be
with my friends.

626
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:26,677
- Well, maybe

627
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,027
this is a chance to, like,

628
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,637
make some new friends.

629
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,639
- What are you talking about?
- Just take a breath, okay?

630
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,860
Have some pâté d'Annie
- Mom, tell me.

631
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:44,347
- I will talk to your dad

632
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:46,349
about D.C.

633
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:48,482
- Really?

634
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,005
- I mean, it's D.C.

635
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,921
We can't be letting down
our founding fathers, can we?

636
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,402
- It's kind of your
constitutional duty.

637
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,404
- Mm.

638
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,628
- Mm.
- Mm.

639
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,108
Mm.

640
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:07,283
Sick nails.

641
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,328
Nancy did 'em.

642
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,199
- You mean her fancy person.

643
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,462
- She doesn't come any more.

644
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:15,074
- What, she's slumming it
at the salon?

645
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,467
- She's doing it herself.

646
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:20,819
- You mean like at home?

647
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,995
- Bought me cosmic blue
on Amazon.

648
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,652
- Why does the cheap stuff
always taste the best?

649
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,089
- They're having
money problems.

Whole Foods in months,

654
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,096

her own takeout.

- Who's that?

658
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,972
- Nancy, Gregg, hello?

659
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,626
Otherwise,
why would I be so excited?

660
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,193

excited you're gonna be

You know, moneywise.

665

- Well, I'm not in a tent.

666

- Yet.

- What's going on?

671
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,358
- Six grand.
- Jesus!

672

- What did you buy?
- Another jazzy?

673
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,801

these janky-ass purses

677

- How many scams
are you running?

678
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,643
- Why does it matter?

679
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,472
- Because it's kind of weird
that you didn't tell us.

680
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,039
- It doesn't involve you.

681
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,911
- It kind of does

682
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,738
if you're doing
something sketch.

683
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:57,089
- We do sketch stuff every day.

684
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,917
- Yeah, because that's
part of our deal.

685
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,266
- We do so much sketch stuff,
I don't even know

686

what's sketch anymore.
- Which we won't have

687
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,922
if they find out that
you're doing something sketch.

688

- She does kind of
have a point.

689
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:12,104
- I mean, excuse me,
but what about your sex tape?

690
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,627
- Not the same.

691
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,107
- It's exactly the same.

692
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,543
- I did that to protect us.

693
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,979
- 'Cause the rules
don't ever apply when it's you.

694
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,634
- You think I wanted
to do that?

695

for the team.

it from that perspective.

take a side already!

So what happens
if you don't get it.

699
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,269
- That'd be bad.

701

- Noticed how things are
different now, that's all.
