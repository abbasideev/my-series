.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,875
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,094
- You ever heard of The System?

4
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:08,791
- That's like a pyramid thing,
right?

5
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,488
- A multi-level opportunity.

6
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,316
- I want to pull Ben out of
St. Anne's.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,144
- I am asking you for a favor
here.

8
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:16,320
- I don't want to be your favor
anymore.

9
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:17,843
- What am I being arrested for?

10
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:19,802
- Trafficking a class one
controlled substance.

11
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,456
- How'd you guys get the
wholesale hook-up?

12
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:23,153
- He would be upset
if I told you.

13
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:24,241
- How'd we do?

14
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:25,721
- You mean how did I do?

15
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:27,505
- Well, it looks like you did
just fine on your own.

16
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:28,898
- Beth can't be a part of this.

17
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,248
She does whatever she wants
whenever she wants.

18
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,902
- We're gonna give them
the broken toy.

19
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,992
- So, what you're saying is
we're framing someone?

20
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,168
- Who the hell's that?

21
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,866
- D.C. is not gonna keep
the tab going much longer.

22
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,694
- Remember when I asked you
to get a juice?

23
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,348
- You want to get a juice,
let's go get a damn juice.

24
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,524
- Just pick a side.

25
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,570
- You need us,
you need all of us.

26
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:49,527
- Not all of you.

27
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:51,921
- Ringside seats, huh?

28
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:54,054
How'd you get these?
- Called in a favor.

29
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,011
- You don't find it
coincidental?

30
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,186
- What's that?

31
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,579
- That both the bullets
in Lucy's head

32
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,102
match the ones
in the other bodies.

33
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,191
- I don't know any Lucy.

34
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,888
- We got him.

35
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:04,499
- Where is he?

36
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,543
- He walked.

37
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,110
- So what do we do about her?

38
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,069
- That's why you got me,
brother.

00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,328
Mm.

Don't look.

Why did you look?

93
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,334
- To see what I wasn't supposed
to look at.

94
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,552
- What happened to our meeting?

95
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,988
- Would you like one?

96
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,295
Uncle Sam is treating.

97
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,601
- I want to know
what's going on.

98
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,255
- D.C. pulled the plug.

99
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,214
- Why?

100
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,998
- Clearly, he's got someone
on the inside.

101
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,957
- I can still get him.

102
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,700
- First night I get here,

103
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,223
I'm about to hit the hay,
right?

104
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,442
I see a spider

105
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,095
in the bed.

106
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,620
Damn thing runs away under the
sheets before I can get him.

107
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,840
I get my phone out, I rip
the place apart--nothing.

108
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,320
But that little bastard,

109
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,931
he's under there, somewhere,
hiding, waiting.

110
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:43,152
You think I'm ever gonna get
back into that bed again?

111
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:45,285
- Where have you been sleeping?

112
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,983
- Bathtub.

113
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,115
- It's just not safe.

114
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,291
- What about my deal?

115
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,293
- Drink.
- What about my husband?

116
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,469
- Drink.

117
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,429
- What about our money?
- Drink.

118
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,344
- There goes Ben's school.

119
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,390
- Stan's out of work.

120
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,782
- Since when?

121
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:07,350
- Since we put away his boss.

122
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:08,699
- Well, what happened
to the girls?

123
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,788
- Heaven and Cinnamon went back
to Arby's.

124
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,529
- Oy.

125
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,096
- Dean's gonna go to jail.

126
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,184
- They can't do that.

127
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,055
- Can't they?

128
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,187
- We have to get to Nevada.

129
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,623
- How?
- They bailed on us.

130
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,972
- Then we have to get there
ourselves.

131
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,192
- Are we talking about
Nevada, Nevada?

132
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,367
- It's a metaphor.

133
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,760
- Just because
I'm not remembering

134
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,370
Nevada's exact
extradition laws,

135
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:28,502
but if this is about Deansie--

136
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,374
- Mexico, Thailand, wherever.

137
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,855
- Who's gonna foot
those moving costs?

138
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,860
- You still have those bags?

139
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,385
- What you doing?

140
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,042
- I'm getting these babies
ready for market.

141
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,348
- Why?

142
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,132
- What do you mean why?

143
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,264
- We don't owe Gene anymore.

144
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,570
- We still got bills.

145
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:54,789
- Oh, some of the girls
were talking about doing

146
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,486
private parties.

147
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,619
- Can't make a living
being a freelance heavy.

148
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,405
- Hmm.

149
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,453
Yeah, all right, I hear you.

150
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,804
I guess we can move
a few of these.

151
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:13,024
- Gotta move
a more than a few.

152
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,157
- It's only two of us.

153
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,378
- Not necessarily.

154
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,816
- No.
- We need help.

155
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,470
- No.
- She helped you.

156
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,036
- No.

157
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,911
- Luck didn't lock Gene up.

158
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,090
- No.

159
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:39,573
- We owe her, Stanley.

160
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,065
- Hey.

161
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,632
How was the game?

162
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,025
- Do we have any razor blades?

163
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,157
- That bad, huh?

164
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,811
- DIY screen repair.

165
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:03,074
Step two, scrape off excess.

166
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:04,424
- Did you score?

167
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,773
- I didn't play.

168
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,862
- What? Who did they put in?
Brad?

169
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,212
- Don't know.
- Ugh.

170
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,258
The coach is, like,
so in love with him.

171
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:16,261
- I'm gonna quit.

172
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,393
- What?

173
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,700
- I want to sell all my gear.

174
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,702
- Why?
- To pay for karate.

175
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,443
- What are you talking about?

176
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,099
- I know I have to go back
to my old school.

177
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:31,538
- I'm so sorry, Bubba.

178
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,104
- It's okay.

179
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,366
- Promise?

180
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,108
- I still follow some friends
from there.

181
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:38,632
- Okay.

182
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,025
- And it's closer. I can bike.

183
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,331
- Yeah, that's true.

184
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,638
- Classes are way easier, too.

185
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,902
- You'll, like,
totally be valedictorian.

186
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:54,474
But don't sell all your gear
just yet, okay?

187
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,388
- They don't have lacrosse.

188
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:57,825
- I know but we could...

189
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,262
find you a club team.

190
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,876
- I'm gonna need the karate
anyway.

191
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,313
- Why?

192
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,664
- Last time I was there,

193
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,971
I wasn't...Ben.

194
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,803
- So Vance says
it's all about your base.

195
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,283
I build up enough contacts
here,

196
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,111
we'll have a little wiggle room
to grow my business

197
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,243
once we get to Nevada.

198
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,549
- That sounds like a plan.

199
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,029
- Yeah, so I had Carlene
send me

200
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:32,076
all our old contacts from
Boland Motors and Bubbles.

201
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,077
- That's smart.

202
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,123
- Yeah.

203
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,346
- What?
- Well...

204
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,347
I don't want to jinx it.

205
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,959
- Oh, come on.

206
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,570
- Just feel like this time,

207
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,312
we got a real chance.

208
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,356
- Mom.

209
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,358
Mom, I gotta poop.

210
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,709
I'll run her home.

211
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:56,971
- Oh, wait.

212
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,668
Are you sure
you didn't want to just

213
00:08:58,712 --> 00:08:59,843
hot bag it in the bushes?

214
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,759
- Yes, I'm positive.
Come on, kid.

215
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,421
- Not a great time.

216
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,118
- I'll make it quick then.

217
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,685
- Can we do this
someplace else?

218
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,645
- Oh, you haven't told him
my good news?

219
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,298
- I don't think
he'll take it that way.

220
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:28,219
I need you to run
a little errand for me.

221
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,047
- They are never little.

222
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:33,573
- Get me my funny money back.

223
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,139
- How am I supposed to do that?

224
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:37,925
- Ask nicely.
- The cops?

225
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,970
Not them.

226
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,283
They're your crew.

227
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,719
- They're leaving.

228
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:52,592
- Never a good time, is it?

229
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,341
.

230
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,213
- I was just thinking,
before you leave,

231
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,606
we could, um,

232
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,999
finally get that green juice.

233
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,742
I could even bring it to
the hotel if that's easier.

234
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:16,441
I don't know if you got
my text, but, um...

235
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,792
call me.
Okay, bye.

236
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,102
- How do you even know
the money's there?

237
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,452
- I don't.

238
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:28,453
- So, wait,
you're just gonna get her

239
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,977
hopped up on green juice?

240
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,327
- Could always roofie her.

241
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,678
- Just to loosen her up,

242
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,375
get her talking.

243
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,856
- You know what
a little errand is?

244
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,118
Picking up the dry cleaning,

245
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,207
dropping off a dog
at the groomer,

246
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,774
getting milk.

247
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,734
Breaking into a hotel room
to steal federal evidence

248
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:50,084
is a kamikaze mission.

249
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,128
- It's suicide.

250
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,827
- That is what kamikaze is.

251
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,220
- That's exactly why we have to
get out of this town.

252
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,569
- Y'all ready?

253
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,225
- Squad up, bitches.

254
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,576
- It's just something we say.

255
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,840
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:09,973
- Oop--
- Oh, no.

257
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:11,148
- Go ahead.
- You take it.

258
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,149
- It's your house.

259
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:14,674
- It's my bags.

260
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,676
- Oh, boy.

261
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,334
- So, last time--
- I was thinking--

262
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,822
- Last time
we hit the third grade,

263
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:33,910
now we do fourth.

264
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,695
- This way,
we don't repeat parents.

265
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,131
- Also,
let's use a different house,

266
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,089
because we got new prospects.

267
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,961
- Oh.

268
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,485
What about Irish twins?

269
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:44,747
- What about them?

270
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,314
- Same parent could have
a kid in third grade

271
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,098
and in fourth grade.

272
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,492
- Not an issue.
- Making sure.

273
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,930
- So I figured that we'd...

274
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,845
break this down into shifts,

275
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,456
maybe over a few days.

276
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,722
- And would that be
the most bang for our buck?

277
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:06,421
- Um, I guess we could

278
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,249
double up in one day.

279
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,556
- I mean the whole school
thing.

280
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,347
I mean, if it ain't broke...

281
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,870
- Okay.

282
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,266
- I mean,
if you see a problem--

283
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:28,312
- No, no, no.
This should work.

284
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,926
- She sees a problem.

285
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,145
- No, not necessarily.

286
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,408
- Phew. Real big one.

287
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:40,020
- Just a little snag.

288
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:44,415
- Hey,

289
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,244
I'm all ears.

290
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,245
- It's kind of risky.

291
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,377
- Here we go.

292
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,292
- Why?

293
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,818
- Well, who's on your mom chain
right now?

294
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,602
- Bunch of people.

295
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,822
- And how many fourth grade
moms are on there?

296
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,824
- Um...

297
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:02,912
Not a lot.

298
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:03,957
- What's your point?

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,046
- Moms talk, a lot.

300
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,482
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:11,355
- And it only takes one
to smell a knock-off.

302
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,444
- Or it's safer.

303
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:14,924
- How's that?

304
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,708
- If someone finds out,
then we can get ahead of it

305
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,971
because we're on
that mom chain.

306
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,103
- Or...

307
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,366
they start another mom chain,

308
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,499
so they can talk about you
behind your back.

309
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:27,894
- How many mom chains
are you on, babe?

310
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,939
- Not a lot.

311
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,985
- And then Harry gets kicked
out of school.

312
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,464
- Come on now.

313
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,292
- And we're all in cuffs.
- That's never gonna happen.

314
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,077
- Why take the chance?

315
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,655
- You know what?

316
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:51,961
I'm just gonna shut up.

317
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,540
- Stan.

318
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,198
- You got a better idea?

319
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,504
- It's whatever you want to do.

320
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,376
- She's got a better idea.

00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,860

- What the hell?

345
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,564
- Who are you?
- We are your halftime show.

346
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:14,870
- Jesus.
- Yeah, uh,

347
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
I think we'll stick
with the main event.

348
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,177
- If you want to see
their goods,

349
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,743
you're gonna have to buy ours.

350
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,963
We got all the brands
right here.

351
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,965
- So bust out
that tip money, gentlemen.

352
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:23,923
- We already paid
for this party.

353
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,272
- Yeah.
- No, you paid

354
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,230
to get this party started.
- You can't do this.

355
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,189
- Oh, but we are.

356
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,279
- What are we gonna do
with a bunch of purses?

357
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,542
- Give them to your wives.

358
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,631
Or your mistresses,
or your girlfriends.

359
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,111
We really don't care.

360
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,895
- All right, how much?

361
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,289
- Start at two grand.
- What?

362
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:43,507
- Who carries that kind
of cash?

363
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:44,813
- Well, you guys always manage
to find it

364
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,554
for the champagne room,
don't you?

365
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,295
- We all accept
all major credit cards,

366
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,471
including Venmo and Apple Pay.

367
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,602
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

368
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,256
Hold up--no.
- Come on over.

369
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,215
Grab them while they're hot.

370
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:56,738
- No, no--what are you doing?

371
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,913
- I need to see those goods.

372
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
- Guys, put your money away.

373
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,744
- Girls, put your clothes on.

374
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,659
- Whoa, come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,227
- Hey, it's pay to play, man.

376
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,577
- The only thing
we're paying for

377
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,927
is some high class ass.

378
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,382
- Um...

379
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,427
- Sorry.

380
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,211
- Okay, thanks.

381
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:40,521
Maybe next time
there won't be a cop.

382
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,884
- Fourth grade moms would have
been way riskier.

383
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:01,846
- Are you kidding me? -
Yeah, come on man.

384
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,283
It's not that great.

385
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,459
- Seriously, how many cars
do you sell in a month?

386
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,504
- 300?

387
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,853
- 300.

388
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,943
- That's more than we'd sell
in a quarter.

389
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,206
- Well,
I learned from the best.

390
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,337
- Aw.

391
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:15,991
You always had the it factor.

392
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,384
- Nobody would have ever
noticed

393
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,386
if you hadn't pulled me up
to the big leagues.

394
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,779
- Best porter we ever had.

395
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:27,263
Okay, you ready?

396
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,700
Hydrator, toner, tightener.

397
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,311
This stuff right here.

398
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,442
It's great for the circles--

399
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,791
the dark circles
under your eyes.

400
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,142
- I'll take one of each, man.

401
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,058
- Wait.

402
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,408
You don't want me to do
the rest of my spiel?

403
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,236
- Nah, no need to.

404
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:46,891
- Yeah, I mean, you'll see,
I mean, it's--

405
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,503
It's really--
it's really solid stuff.

406
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:52,114
- If you say so, I am in.

407
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,637
- And,

408
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,336
when you respond
the way I know you will,

409
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,816
we can even talk about

410
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,861
other opportunities.

411
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,254
- I'm pretty busy right now.

412
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:02,516
- No, I know, I know--

413
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,734
I'm just saying, like,
in the slow months,

414
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,258
it's an easy way
to put a little extra cash

415
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,912
in your pocket.

416
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,263
- Pyramid schemes aren't really
my thing.

417
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,097
- It's more of a--

418
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,709
you know, community of men
supporting each other.

419
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,936
- You ever think about
coming back on the lot?

420
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
- Uh...

421
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,161
Nah, it's not--

422
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,423
it's not my bag anymore.

423
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,556
- Friend of mine
over at, um,

424
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,123
Southfield Volvo

425
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,908
said they're losing one of
their best sales guys.

426
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,779
- Southfield, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

427
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,955
I can put in a word.

428
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,522
- I'm my own boss now.

429
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,697
- Just get lunch with the guy,

430
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:54,698
feel it out.

431
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,962
- You know what?

432
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,139
Um, actually, I can just
do all this for you.

433
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,270
You don't--
you don't need to be--

434
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,707
- That your phone?

435
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:17,330
- Yeah, I think it's--

436
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,462
I think it's, uh--

437
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,683
Out of batteries.

438
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,427
I should really get going.

439
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,219
- Also need a copy
of the arrest file.

440
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,568
- Should be there.

441
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,309
- It's not.

442
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,529
- Hang on.

443
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,185
- Don't see it.

444
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,057
- Well, maybe they threw it out
when they threw out my case.

445
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,190
- No, nope, here we go.

446
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,843
- Hm.

447
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,066
- Sign the release.

448
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,251
- That it?

449
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,297
- Why'd they throw out
your case?

450
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,951
- Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't be going home.

451
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,739
Pays to have friends
in high places, huh?

452
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,488
- Hey, Shel.

453
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,838
- I'm not sharing this.

454
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,927
- I need something
from evidence.

455
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,193
She was someone's daughter.

456
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,413
- Rather give you
half my sandwich.

457
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,765
- You're the best.

458
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:49,422
.

459
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,554
- Order up.

460
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,295
- This is a little
embarrassing.

461
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,731
- Hit me.

462
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:55,732
- Got kids?

463
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,821
- Mm-mm.
Married to the city.

464
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:01,521
- Ah.
My daughter, she's nine.

465
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,131
She's a big MMA fan.

466
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,698
- Mm.
Who's her favorite?

467
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,221
Anyone who kicks ass.

468
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,441
- The whole girl power thing.

469
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,660
- Right. Right, right, right.
- Yeah.

470
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,749
- So what can I do for you?

471
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,273
- There you go.
- Mm.

472
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,929
- Heard you're the ticket guy.

473
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,757
- How's that?

474
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,977
- Word is you got the hook-up
for all the best fights.

475
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,459
Says who?

476
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,114
- Can't be humble on Instagram.

477
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,420
- Office seats.

478
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,726
- Hook a guy up?

479
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,554
- Those are usually reserved
for donors,

480
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:37,208
Make-A-Wish kids, you know.

481
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,428
- What about murderers?

482
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,694
- I don't know anything
about this.

483
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:48,568
- How'd they end up with a
gang banger tied to a homicide?

484
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,657
- I guess,
maybe they scalped them.

485
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,093
- One of the cancer kids?

486
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,050
- Mm.

487
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,577
- Sorry,
what was your precinct?

488
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,840
- Fourteen.
- Mm.

489
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,757
Let me see what I can do
for your daughter.

490
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,802
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah.

491
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,327
Have a good day, officer.
- You too.

492
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:14,245
- And I've been using the same
shampoo bottle for, like,

493
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,290
a year.

494
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,989
Just add water and shake.

495
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,122
And I've never bought ketchup
or soy sauce,

496
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,516
I have a whole drawer
dedicated to freebies.

497
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,041
And I always order
off the kid's menu.

498
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,739
- No doubt about it.

499
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,654
You're poor.
- Yes.

500
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,308
- Maybe the poorest
I've ever seen.

501
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,310
- Thank you.
- But we can't grant you

502
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,616
financial aid.

503
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,183
- Have you gotten to
the part yet

504
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:42,230
where we lived off a deer
for an entire winter?

505
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:44,537
- The problem is
your drug charge.

506
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,021
- I can explain.

507
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:53,067
That was because
a man tried to rape me,

508
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,503
and when I wouldn't let him
rape me, he tr--

509
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,984
- It's just school policy.

510
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,946
- The thing is,

511
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,905
Ben loves this school.
- We love Ben.

512
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,820
- Ben loves this school
so much that he's, like--

513
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:09,388
one of those kids
that you see on a brochure,

514
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,042
that you're sure has to be an
actor because they're so happy.

515
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:16,046
But actually,
Ben is so happy at school.

516
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,049
- What about Ben's father?

517
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,751
- Isn't there any other way?

518
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:27,710
- Do you have a boyfriend?
Domestic partner?

519
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:31,410
- Okay, well, now you're just
rubbing it in.

520
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,720
- Is there anyone you get naked
with regularly?

521
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,636
- That counts?

522
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,073
- If they share your address.

523
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:10,492
- Ooh.

524
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,625
Jesus.

525
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:15,889
- I brought bagels.

526
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:19,022
- Man, DWP was jackhammering
all night.

527
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,634
- You want everything
or poppy?

528
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,290
I gave you a house key?

529
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,468
- Oh, I used the spare.

530
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,999
It's been a while.

531
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:43,133
- Yeah, I got--
sorry, so busy--

532
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,222
- Could have called.
- I lost my phone.

533
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,311
- Still liked my TikToks.

534
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,922
- Hey, question--

535
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:51,794
you don't have
any kind of like--

536
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,449
record or anything like that,
right?

537
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,711
- Huh?

538
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,321
- You know, like,

539
00:24:57,365 --> 00:25:01,587
drug charges or felonies...

540
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:06,983
What do you want?

541
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,245
- Nothing.

542
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,162
- You only come over
when you need something.

543
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,424
- Excuse me

544
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:16,471
for trying to have
a nice breakfast moment

545
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:21,302
with...my...boyfriend.

546
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:23,609
- Wow.

547
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:26,220
All right, seriously,
why are you here?

548
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:30,572
- Just--

549
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,835
here.

550
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:36,056
Fill these out, and for the
address, just use mine.

551
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,369
- Well, if I do this,

552
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,851
you gotta do something for me.

553
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:52,768
- Yeah, I'm not really ready
for the tattoo thing.

554
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:55,336
- Never come here again.

555
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,209
- Okay.

556
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:05,868
- And leave the bagels.

557
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,350
- It's like my uniform,
you know?

558
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:11,352
I don't even work out.
- Neither do I.

559
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,310
- But I still put them on
every morning like it's my job.

560
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,835
- That's why I focus
on my accessories.

561
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,664
- Because I may not feel great
in my jeans, but my bags?

562
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:19,708
They always look hot.

563
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,405
- I wish I could afford it.

564
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,233
- Convince your husband
that you need one.

565
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,714
- He just sent me
on a girls trip to Chicago.

566
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,890
- Ooh, fun.
- Go, go, go, come on.

567
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,023
Get your snack. Move it.
- Stop running.

568
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,328
We're not gonna be late,
all right?

569
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,808
- Hey, hun.

570
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,027
This is Beth.

571
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,770
Her oldest did Ladybug
with Olivia.

572
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,641
I feel so bad
I didn't remember that.

573
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,904
- Please, it was forever ago.

574
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,253
- She's selling
these cute bags.

575
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,604
Kim just bought one.

576
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,344
- How do you know Kim?

577
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,563
- Friend of a friend.

578
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,086
- Mom, where are the nuggets?

579
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,175
- In the freezer,
where they always are.

580
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,047
- No, they're not.

581
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,615
- Excuse me.

582
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:02,272
- What is this?

583
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:05,406
- Never use your real info
when booking strippers.

584
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,496
- Do you want to get arrested?

585
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:12,543
- I want you and your friends
to all buy your wives a bag.

586
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:14,589
- Or maybe you're just dumb.

587
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,112
- No, dumb would be
thinking that

588
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,811
I didn't record everything
the other night.

589
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,205
- Hey, babe,
we're out of nuggets.

590
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,685
- Ooh, I wanted to show you
one more thing

591
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,121
because I forgot to bring
the snakeskin.

592
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,080
- Oh, that might be
a bit much for me.

593
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,473
- Come on, you just have to
channel your inner stripper.

594
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,956
Here it is.

595
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,697
So this is from a trunk show

596
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:36,829
that we did the other night.

597
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:39,570
- Let's just get it.

598
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,355
- Babe, these are expensive.

599
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,184
- Call it an early birthday
present, huh?

600
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,968
- Wow.

601
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,796
Someone won the husband
lottery, huh?

602
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,668
- I so did.

603
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:56,022
- Uh, maybe the other guys
wives would dig them, huh?

604
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,240
- Are you kidding?
They would love them.

605
00:27:57,284 --> 00:28:00,679
- I would appreciate
the referrals.

606
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:04,508
.

607
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,293
- What are all these emojis?

608
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,294
- That's everybody paying
everybody.

609
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:08,469
- That's confusing.

610
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,558
- Okay, click there.

611
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,388
So that's everyone paying you.

612
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,477
See? One emoji.

613
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,348
- Is that a middle finger?

614
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,915
- You did blackmail him.

615
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:26,400
- Well...

616
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:27,401
- Happy hour?

617
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,403
- Very happy.

618
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,405
- She got the money.
- Well, not all of it.

619
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:32,754
A few guys want to pay in cash

620
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,408
'cause they don't want it
on record.

621
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,541
- Cool.

622
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,808
-  Cool.

623
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,376
- Can somebody read
my Bio report?

624
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,030
- What's it on?

625
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,640
- Cellular organelles.

626
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:52,165
- Yeah, that's all you.
- Okay.

627
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,385
You know I was the queen of
cellular organelles,

628
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,432
back in the day.

629
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:05,787
- Is your account @ThemHills?

630
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,355
- Yep.

631
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,754
- And...

632
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,191
that is your cut.

633
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,758
- Must feel good
proving me wrong.

634
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,587
- Feels better
to get the money.

635
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:27,026
- Like that's why you did it.

636
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,463
- What's your problem?

637
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,599
- You.

638
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,341
- Okay, I'm sorry that I--

639
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,778
- You could have waited
for the next party.

640
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,388
- I saved our asses.
- No, you went back over there

641
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,868
because your ego
couldn't take the hit.

642
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,000
- Okay, let's not talk
about ego.

643
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,523
- Got ignored for so long
in your own home--

644
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,742
- Mister "my bags."

645
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,396
- Now all you want to do
is matter.

646
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,832
- Excuse me?

647
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:54,357
- You use whoever you can
to get whatever you want.

648
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,708
- I got you your money.

649
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,798
- You got my wife shot.

650
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,629
And that's the least of it.

651
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:11,070
- If you think that I would
ever do anything to hurt her--

652
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,680
- I think that you don't think

653
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,726
about anyone
but yourself, Beth.

654
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,819
- Ready to go?

655
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,692
- Yeah, let me grab my jacket.

656
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,050
- What are you doing here?

657
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,226
- Do you want to have
that green juice?

658
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,967
- I'm kind of over it.

659
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,664
- Good.

660
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,144
'Cause that's why
I brought this.

661
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,667
- I got work to do.

662
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,322
- Is that your version of
"gotta pick up the kids?"

663
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,847
- Only mine's real.

664
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,937
- I'm not a total bitch.

665
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,682
- I only do shots.

666
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,686
- Hey.

667
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,601
All right,
let me ask you something.

668
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:06,125
- You got a glass?

669
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,996
- Uh...your choice.

670
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,737
Mug or sippy cup?

671
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,913
- Never mind.
- Okay.

672
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,441
What do you know about cars?

673
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,703
- I know what I like.

674
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,922
- No, like,
how they work--

675
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,882
like, why is a Cadillac good
for one guy,

676
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,797
but a BMW is great
for someone else?

677
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,325
I was really good at that.

678
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,935
- You're a natural.

679
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,155
- At cars.

680
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:39,723
- Think I see
where this is going.

681
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,725
- You guys have been
so incredible to me--

682
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,989
- When you were little,
what did you want to be?

683
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,861
- Easy, astronaut.

684
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,036
- Stuntman.

685
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,211
- Okay, so?

686
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:51,213
- You didn't know anything
about cars.

687
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:52,780
I didn't know anything about
men's skincare.

688
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,477
- I got a better chance
at being an astronaut--

689
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,870
- But you have something
down here

690
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,480
that you wouldn't have
in outer space.

691
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:59,439
- What's that?

692
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,093
- This guy.

693
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,661
- It's just not for me.

694
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:09,057
And look, I really hope

695
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:12,800
that I can still bike
with you and the guys.

696
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:13,714
- Dude.

697
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:15,890
You're my ride or die.

698
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,414
Come on.
- 'Cause you're mine, so--

699
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,982
- You just write me a check
for the product, we're good.

700
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,550
- Oh, okay--um,

701
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:26,596
so I knew this was coming,

702
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,121
so I boxed it up.

703
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,081
- These are just the samples.

704
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,953
- That's all you gave me.

705
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,827
- When you sign up, you commit
to product for the year.

706
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,746
- How much product?

707
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:48,009
- I got a whole garage full
for you.

708
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,409
- Maybe I'll give it
another shot.

709
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:57,758
- You just gotta get
your groove.

710
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:03,503
- What's the deal with local
news these days, anyways?

711
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:04,808
It's like, what's the point?

712
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,114
Unless you don't have a phone,

713
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,811
because I'm pretty sure
by the time you get home

714
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:10,292
and it's 11:00 p.m.,
you've been reading

715
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,469
all about everything
that's been happening all day.

716
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:14,775
It's kind of like, uh,
