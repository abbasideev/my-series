Yeah, that's why
you the king, man.

357
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,604
‐ Can't have it happen again
though.

358
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,691
‐ Not on my watch.

359
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,568
I hear you loud and clear.

360
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,574
All right.

361
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,075
‐ Oh, and whenever's
good for you,

362
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,077
I would love to hear
about them private parties

363
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,080
you've been running
behind my back with my girls.

364
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,387
‐ Now's good.

365
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,269
‐ This is currency.

366
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,770
Like, top dollar.

367
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,939
You could trade it
for anything:

368
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,859
supplies, TV time,

369
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,861
protection.

370
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,614
‐ Who are you?

371
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,865
‐ I know your wife.

372
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,075
‐
I want a lawyer here.

373
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,411
‐ Chill, I just gave you
a bunch of ramen.

374
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,419
I had this friend
in high school.

375
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,962
Super cool.

376
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,797
Captain of
the cheerleading squad.

377
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,090
‐ Hmm.

378
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,302
‐ Always had the newest jeans.
The most expensive makeup.

379
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,137
Everyone wanted to be her,

380
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,473
including me.

381
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,642
She threw the best parties,

382
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,061
and I would bring
the wine coolers.

383
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,562
I was, like, in.

384
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,607
We'd go to the movies,
the mall.

385
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,235
We were besties before people
used the word "besties."

386
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,738
And then my parents
took away my fake ID,

387
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,824
and she stopped
calling me back.

388
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,245
‐ What's your point?

389
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,122
‐ Women like your wife,

390
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,874
they use people,

391
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,627
and when they're done,
they throw them in the trash.

392
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,338
‐ So you don't know my wife.

393
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,507
‐ I know the wrong person

394
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,926
is sitting across
from me right now.

395
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,767
‐ So what?

396
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,811
‐ I just need something on her.

397
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,484
Without it, you're gonna need
a lot more of these.

398
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,117
So what's gonna be, Mr. Boland?

399
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,711
‐ Hey.

400
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,047
Is your sister home?

401
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,466
‐ Doesn't wanna see you.

402
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,219
‐ Did you give her
any of my messages?

403
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,887
‐ Hates your guts.

404
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,889
‐ She said that?

405
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,141
‐ Thinks you're a total loser,

406
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,517
regrets ever looking
at your ugly face,

407
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,728
and wishes you'd just die.

408
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,896
‐ Hmm.

409
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,565
‐ Brutal.

410
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,317
‐ Yeah, so can I
just go talk to her?

411
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,528
‐ What's it worth to you?

412
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,865
‐ Wow.

413
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,742
Okay.
All right, fine.

414
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,746
‐ 4 bucks?

415
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,289
‐ That's all I got.

416
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,292
‐ You can owe me.

417
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,210
Deansie's here!

418
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,462
‐ No one calls me that.

419
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,092
‐ Annie.

420
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,386
Mom needs you.

421
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,265
What are you doing here?

422
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
‐ I called you
like five times.

423
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,186
‐
I've been busy.

424
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,937
‐ You haven't been
at any of the games.

425
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,022
‐ I got a lot going on.

426
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,857
‐ I thought we were cool.
‐ We are.

427
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,109
‐ 'Cause if I'm way off,
it's totally okay.

428
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,944
‐ It's not that.
‐ I don't wanna look like

429
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,488
a dick, you know?

430
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,116
‐ I can't find her meds.

431
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,160
‐ Be right there.
‐

432
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,662
‐

433
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,665
It's not you.
‐ Gotcha.

434
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,793
So it's definitely me then.

435
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,127
‐ It's not either of us.

436
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,420
‐ It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

437
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,297
I was gonna ask you to prom,

438
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,883
but it's all good.

439
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,384
‐ You were?

440
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,053
‐ I don't wanna put
any pressure on you.

441
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,806
‐ I'd love to go.

442
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,141
‐ Uh, okay.

443
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,476
Cool.

444
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,479
‐ Yeah.
Cool.

445
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,606
‐

446
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,541
‐ Mrs. Boland?

447
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,209
He doesn't wanna see you.

448
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,677
‐

449
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,804
Turns out if you
make a fart noise

450
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,181
with every math problem
he gets right, he can focus.

451
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,016
‐ Got your bills.

452
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,561
‐ How'd it go?

453
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,480
‐
Piece of cake.

454
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,024
‐ I'm gonna pay you back.

455
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,985
It's just gonna take a second.

456
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,028
‐ No rush.

457
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,823
‐ Really?

458
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,201
You good?

459
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,121
‐
Just thirsty.

460
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,748
‐ At a certain point,

461
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,959
you don't really
need the glass, do you?

462
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,970
‐ Had a day.

463
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,351
‐ He'll get over it.

464
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,395
‐ What if he doesn't?

465
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,064
‐ You've done way worse.

466
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,150
‐ I'm a monster.

467
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,735
‐ I mean, he stuck around

468
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,486
after you bone surfed
the guy who shot him.

469
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,572
‐ The kind
that climbs skyscrapers

470
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,365
and destroys cities.

471
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,075
‐ Yeah, well,
at least your kids

472
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,370
are still talking to you.
‐ Because they don't know.

473
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,955
‐ Ben won't even look at me.

474
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,958
‐ Maybe they've all
just had enough of us.

475
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,418
‐

476
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,337
God, we are monsters.

477
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,089
‐ Incoming.

478
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:49,094
Last dance, ladies.

479
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,930
‐ Let's make it a good one.

480
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,389
‐ Not too good.

481
00:23:55,434 --> 00:24:02,608
♪ ♪

482
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:22,711
♪ ♪

483
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,934
‐ You sure about this?

484
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,353
‐ It'll work.

485
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,982
‐ Looks legit.

486
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,818
‐ It's not.
‐ Our worst batch yet.

487
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,028
‐ Your one way ticket
to Shangri‐La.

488
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,577
‐ All right.

489
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,205
See you hotties
on the other side.

490
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,851
I'd like to open
a new account.

491
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,686
‐ Certainly, sir.

492
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,188
I'm just gonna need you
to fill out a few forms

493
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,024
and a valid ID.

494
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,361
Thank you.
Um, just to let you know,

495
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,197
we do require
a minimum balance of $50.

496
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,033
‐ Oh, that won't be a problem.

497
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,537
‐ Uh, w‐what are you doing?

498
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,582
‐ Giving you 100,000 smackaroos
to babysit.

499
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,501
‐ Um, anything over 10 grand

500
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,879
we have to report to the IRS.

501
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,840
‐ Ooh.
That'll be a problem.

502
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,217
‐ Thought it might be.

503
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,971
‐ So how 'bout we do 10 grand
in ten different accounts?

504
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,474
‐ Um, we don't do that here,
sir.

505
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,725
‐ Okay, okay.

506
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,060
9 grand
in nine different accounts,

507
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,228
and uh,

508
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,147
you keep this for yourself.

509
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,899
‐ Is there a problem here?

510
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,485
‐ Uh, yes, there is.
I'm being profiled.

511
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,694
‐ Excuse me?

512
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,071
‐ She won't take
my hard‐earned money.

513
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,739
‐ How is that profiling?

514
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,409
‐ Mustache.
‐  That's not a thing.

515
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,411
‐ Sir, we're
a family‐owned bank.

516
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,455
‐ Then take my money,
it's good.

517
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,290
‐ We really don't want
any trouble.

518
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,918
‐ Go ahead.
Test it yourself.

519
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,463
‐ Why would we need
to do that?

520
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,718
‐ Been in there a while.
‐ Can we please just go?

521
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,595
‐ No, I wanna watch.

522
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,263
‐ Well, I don't.

523
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,349
I feel bad enough as it is.

524
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,017
‐ Shh.
Listen.

525
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,898
‐ Here we go.

526
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,779
‐ Kay, show 'em the money.

527
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,538
‐ Ooh, ooh.
It is on.

528
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,331
‐ Oh, boy,
he is getting worked.

529
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,958
‐

530
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,043
‐ Was that really necessary?

531
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,505
‐ Fell for the honeypot.

532
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,138
‐ Okay, what are
they doing now?

533
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,308
‐ All right.

534
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,143
What?

535
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,645
‐ Uh‐oh.

536
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,647
‐ I go in the back.

537
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,315
Hey, I go in the back.

538
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,150
Hey.
Guys.

539
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,788
‐ What the hell?

540
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,419
‐ What happened?

541
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,296
‐ I think I got robbed.

542
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,715
‐ By cops?

543
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,892
.

544
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,022
‐ She's stable now.

545
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,857
We had to sedate her
to pump her stomach.

546
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,650
She'll be out for a while.

547
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,652
Any other family
I should notify?

548
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,950
‐ It's just me and my sister.

549
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,913
‐ Your mom's gonna be okay.

550
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,405
‐ I went to pick you up.

551
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,407
‐ Oh, God.

552
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,867
What'd she say?

553
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,078
‐ That you didn't wanna go.

554
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,914
At least not with me,
'cause...

555
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:12,584
I'm the dumbest, ugliest
tool that's ever lived.

556
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,253
‐ I'm gonna kill her.

557
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,590
‐ But 40 bucks later,

558
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,760
and here I am.

559
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,054
‐ You didn't have to come.

560
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,898
‐ Got you something.

561
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,786
You look great by the way.

562
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,211
‐ So do you.

563
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,630
‐
Yeah, I know.

564
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:02,217
‐

565
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:09,182
♪ ♪

566
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,484
‐ Um, do you want anything

567
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,486
from the vending machine?

568
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,488
‐ No.

569
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,323
‐ Okay, good, 'cause...

570
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,492
your little sister
took all my money.

571
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,327
‐

572
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,541
‐ Here's a thought.
‐ Oh, boy.

573
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,002
‐ I go right back in there,
grab that guard's gun,

574
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,504
shoot up the place.

575
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,090
‐ Why?
‐ Get their attention.

576
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,843
‐ So then they put you in jail
with Dean

577
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,471
and not instead of.
‐ Oh.

578
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,016
Plan C‐‐

579
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,976
‐ Please no.
‐ Try a different bank.

580
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,352
‐ And deposit what?

581
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,146
Those crooked cops
took everything we made.

582
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,355
‐ Hey, maybe
they'll realize it's fake,

583
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,690
and they'll come back
and nab him.

584
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,276
‐ No, they didn't even
look at my ID.

585
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,949
‐ Okay.
What's plan C?

586
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,369
‐ Track those guys down.
‐ The cops?

587
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,246
‐ We pull in front of their
cruiser, jam on the brakes.

588
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,582
And they slam into us.

589
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,167
Bam!
Airbags go off.

590
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,001
Pssh!

591
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,878
We hop out,
shatter their window.

592
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,379
Cchh!
Get the keys to the trunk.

593
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,631
‐ Make it stop.

594
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,051
‐ How can it possibly be this
difficult to get you arrested?

595
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,720
‐ 'Cause I'm invisible.

596
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,722
‐ What do you mean?

597
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,724
‐ I've been that way
my whole life.

598
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,226
Smack in the middle
of nine kids,

599
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,977
you get used to being left
in a hot car.

600
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,729
‐ That's terrible.

601
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,232
‐ It all kinda changed for me
when the D‐man got hired.

602
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,568
Brought me to lunch
with the rest of the crew.

603
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,861
Called me Eric.

604
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,862
‐ What'd everybody else
call you?

605
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,072
‐ Scott.

606
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,908
‐ I see that.
He's got a Scott vibe.

607
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,911
‐ Anyway, lunch becomes
work drinks,

608
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,414
and next thing you know,
I'm finally a real person.

609
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,292
Oh, they don't make them
like Dean Boland anymore.

610
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,004
But I don't need
to tell you that.

611
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,842
‐ I know.

612
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,012
‐ Plan D‐‐
‐ No more plans, Eric.

613
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,931
‐ Thank Jesus.

614
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,350
‐ What do you want me to do?

615
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,893
‐ Nothing.

616
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,448
Hey.
I made breakfast for dinner.

617
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,118
‐ I'm not hungry.

618
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,333
What are you doing?

619
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,794
‐ You are gonna eat this.
‐ Can I go to the bathroom?

620
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,629
‐ You love breakfast
for dinner.

621
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,964
‐ I ate at Mark's house!

622
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,800
‐ Oh, a lacrosse buddy?

623
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,635
‐ What do you want?

624
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,638
‐ I want you to talk me
like a normal person.

625
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,973
‐ You're not a normal person.

626
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,310
‐ Then talk to me like you want
me to be your mom again, like‐‐

627
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,811
‐ I don't even know
what that means.

628
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,439
‐ Like you don't hate me
so much.

629
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,482
'Cause, you know,

630
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,651
if you...

631
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,487
if you're unhappy here...

632
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,949
you could always stay
at your dad's more.

633
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,327
‐ You think I hate you?

634
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,333
‐ You haven't talked to me
in, like, three days.

635
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,543
‐ It doesn't mean I hate you.

636
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,840
‐ Kay.

637
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,301
‐ I love breakfast for dinner.

638
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,094
‐ Me too.

639
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,183
‐ Makes sense though.
‐ Hmm?

640
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,019
‐ Just for, like, practice
and school and stuff.

641
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,520
‐ What?

642
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,690
‐ Staying with Dad more.

643
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,192
‐ Oh, yeah?

644
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,361
‐ Nancy would never
go for it though.

645
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,113
She's, like,
so OCD with Dakota.

646
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,160
‐ I could talk to her.

647
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,330
‐ Really?
‐ Why not?

648
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,916
‐ I can just come back
for some of the weekends.

649
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,876
‐ If that's what you want,
yeah.

650
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,879
‐ Not that I want it.

651
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,882
It would just save a lot
of time going back and forth.

652
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,176
‐ Cool.

653
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,889
‐ I still gotta pee.

654
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,474
‐ Yes.

655
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,249
‐ No classes today?

656
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,251
‐ I don't really
teach boot camp.

657
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,753
‐ I don't really sell hot tubs.

658
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,548
‐ Yeah, I know.

659
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,757
‐ Mommy!

660
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,093
Look how high I'm going!

661
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,179
‐ Wow!
Like an astronaut!

662
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,438
It all started
about a year ago.

663
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,441
I robbed a grocery store.

664
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,568
It was supposed to be
one and done.

665
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,782
Don't you want to record this
or something?

666
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,951
‐ It doesn't matter.

667
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,661
‐ Why?

668
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,124
‐ Your husband
pled guilty today.

669
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,089
‐ Mommy!
Mommy, watch me!

670
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,062
‐ Jesus!

671
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,066
‐ Your elderly neighbor
was getting curious

672
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,360
the longer I stood
at your door.

673
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,655
‐ Why does everyone think

674
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,657
they can just let themselves
in to my house?

675
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,076
‐ These things are
extremely easy to find

676
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,244
once you know
what you're looking for.

677
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,123
‐ I'd offer you a drink, but...
‐ All set.

678
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,673
‐ I can't go to Fiji with you.

679
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,633
‐ Why not?

680
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,969
Huts over the water,

681
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,806
looking at the fish
while you sip your cocktail,

682
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,183
nothing but privacy.

683
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,352
‐ I'm in a little bit
of trouble right now.

684
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,480
‐ Perfect time for an escape.
‐ And I have kids.

685
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,357
‐ Happy to make arrangements
for them as well.

686
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,652
I hear your husband's gonna
be tied up for a while.

687
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,322
‐ Put down your tea.

688
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,990
‐ Pardon me?
‐ Get naked, come on.

689
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,867
‐ What?
‐ Let's go!

690
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,453
‐ Now?
‐ Why, you need a pill?

691
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,872
'Cause I've gotta pick up
my kids soon.

692
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,833
‐ I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

693
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,209
‐ Really?

694
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,877
Because you have made it
very clear

695
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,046
that this is exactly
what I need to do.

696
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,298
‐ Not like this.

697
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,217
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.

698
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,553
Was I supposed to enjoy it?

699
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,555
Maybe fall in love with you?

700
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,015
End up on some remote island
so you can live out

701
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,685
your twisted mid‐life crisis?

702
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,897
‐ I thought you wanted...

703
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,524
more.

704
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,152
‐ From you?
‐ From your life.

705
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,363
‐ Oh, and I need a man
to do that?

706
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,243
‐ What do you want?
‐ To be nothing like you.

707
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,870
‐ A little late for that.
‐ Why?

708
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,831
‐ You hired me, remember?

709
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,918
‐ Then why don't you pull up
your pants like a big boy

710
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,504
and do your job?

711
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,515
‐ Well.

712
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,272
Seems I read this all wrong.

713
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,608
