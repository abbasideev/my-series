1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,875
Previously on "Good Girls"...

2
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:06,832
You can stay at St. Anne's.

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,008
- How?
- Well...

4
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:09,139
Yo, you're out of Q-tips.

5
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,488
- That's my toothbrush.
- Roomie.

6
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,055
You ever heard of The System?

7
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,467
That's like a
pyramid thing, right?

8
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,493
A multilevel opportunity.

9
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:18,105
Does feel like this time
we got a real chance.

10
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,758
Or you haven't told
him our good news?

11
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,301
I don't think he'll
take it that way.

12
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,979
I want to know what's going on.

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,633
- D.C. pulled the plug.
- Why?

14
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,089
Clearly he's got
someone on the inside.

15
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,331
I wore you out already?

16
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,681
- No, cousin.
- Yo.

17
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,770
- Dean's gonna go to jail.
- They can't do that.

18
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,511
- Can't they?
- We have to get to Nevada.

19
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,165
Who's gonna foot
those moving costs?

20
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,645
You still have those bags?

21
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:38,101
I guess we could
move a few of these.

22
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,909
- We need help.
- No.

23
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:41,302
- She helped you.
- No!

24
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,826
You use whoever you can
to get whatever you want.

25
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,436
I got you your money.

26
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,134
You got my wife shot.

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,950
What time is it?

28
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,343
Time to sleep in.

29
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,693
Are the kids up?

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,564
I got it.

31
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,218
You da best.

32
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,579
Breakfast time!

33
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:42,991
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-
dut-dut-dut-dut-duh!

34
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,669
Wake up, maggots!

35
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,758
- Ah!

36
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:56,159
- I'm up!
- Okay, man.

37
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,595
If you're not up in five,

38
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,728
I'm coming back with the
fire extinguisher again.

39
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:33,109
And music camp was
so great to have,

40
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,677
and learning to play the
guitar and song-writing...

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,548
Oh. Hey.

42
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:40,464
Look at what I got. Mint.

43
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:44,076
I got Maple Creme.
I got Birthday Cake.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,730
And I got Double Stuf.

45
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,515
Trade amongst yourselves,
mix and match,

46
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,560
but do not tell your mother.

47
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,823
Wait, wait. Where
is she, by the way?

48
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,738
Work.

49
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,915
We're... we're supposed to
load up the minivan, right?

50
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,048
I don't know.

51
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:00,876
When is she coming home?

52
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,008
I don't know.

53
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,706
But she said no snacks.

54
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,624
Ink, chemicals, paper.

55
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,931
- The hologram's polymer.
- One-stop shop.

56
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,585
Everything you need.

57
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,284
And why you making it so easy?

58
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,982
'Cause you bitches
made it so messy.

59
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,071
And what happens
when I gotta wash it?

60
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:23,464
Don't worry about it.

61
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,857
Where am I supposed to do it?

62
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,729
Duty-free?

63
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,513
Tim Horton's downtown?
They take Canadian?

64
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,385
You don't have to.

65
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,864
What about my cut?

66
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,214
What about it?

67
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,215
Does it come in loonies?

68
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,912
Elizabeth.

69
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,483
All you have to do

70
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,659
is print and drop.

71
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,447
Your husband's here.

72
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,326
- Just need to...

73
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,415
Trade cars.

74
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,027
Now?

75
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,553
Thought we would hit the
road early for, you know.

76
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,816
Oh. Kenny's game, yeah.

77
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,389
You're not supposed to be here.

78
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,696
Yeah. Neither are you.

79
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,611
No, man, I mean,

80
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:27,092
it's not gonna be good for
anybody when the cops come.

81
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,400
- I'm within range.
- It's low battery.

82
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,623
Please, just go.

83
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:55,599
How you feel about baby blue?

84
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,036
- Eh.
- Okay.

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,823
How about... ostrich?

86
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,825
Better.

87
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,957
Okay, okay.

88
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,872
What if...

89
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,615
We combine the two?

90
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,444
- That the new one?
- Yep.

91
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,446
She said we could
swap whatever we want.

92
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,230
Awesome.

93
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,407
Yeah. Lowers our cost like 8%.

94
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,234
Good for you.

95
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:23,540
This is good for sales.

96
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,412
Next party is gonna
be pure profit, baby.

97
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:27,718
Oh, I'm not going.

98
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,461
Hey, what, now?

99
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,028
I can't.

100
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,031
I didn't even tell
you when it is.

101
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:37,554
Doesn't matter.

102
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,948
Wait, baby, you're the one

103
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,342
that wanted to keep
this train running.

104
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,214
Not if you two are gonna
keep clapping at each other.

105
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,825
Oh, my God. Ruby.

106
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,914
No one is clapping at anyone.

107
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,176
No, it's worse.

108
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,830
Last party, you didn't
even speak to her.

109
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,223
What? I got nothing to say.

110
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,399
I had to be the damn
go-between for my husband

111
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:59,315
- and my best friend.
- Then don't be.

112
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,664
You don't have to love her.

113
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,058
- I don't.
- Don't even have to like her.

114
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:07,062
- Oh, I don't.
- Just take the high road.

115
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,022
What for?

116
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,720
Me.

117
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:18,552
You say all this to her?

118
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,736
She could take the high road.

119
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,479
Our first family meeting.

120
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,396
Just meeting.

121
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,832
One sec.

122
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:45,230
Okay, first up, let's go
over the bathroom rules.

123
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,971
I know, I know. Off-limits.

124
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,626
No. We're cool if you use it.

125
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,628
But I got the bucket.

126
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,935
Yeah, we'd, uh

127
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,937
we'd actually like you
to get rid of that.

128
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,591
Mm.

129
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:01,290
Number two, do not wash your
underwear in the kitchen sink.

130
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,292
Mm, let me guess. Bathroom.

131
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,120
Washer. It's in the basement.

132
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,817
And it's free.

133
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,645
Whaaaat?

134
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,954
Okay. Um...

135
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:16,566
Where do you guys
stand on parties?

136
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,829
- Anti.
- We're also anti-your music

137
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,484
and the shopping cart
that's parked in the hallway

138
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,573
with all of the cans in it.

139
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,184
- My bank account?
- Gotta go.

140
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:33,757
Which, I believe, brings
us to the timeline.

141
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,890
How long are we talking here?

142
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,632
For what?

143
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,504
For the length of stay.

144
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,681
I don't understand the question.

145
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,509
When will you be leaving?

146
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,729
Well, when's graduation?

147
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,167
Uh...

148
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,788
Is his name Chris or Kevin?

149
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:07,225
It is way too late to ask.

150
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,496
Car is packed.

151
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,063
They hit the ice at 7:00.

152
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,761
Okay.

153
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,371
Next year, he'll
be bantamweight,

154
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,548
so you won't have to get
up at the crack of dawn.

155
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,071
Dean.

156
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,510
I mean, I really wish
I could take him.

157
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,730
No one knew this would happen.

158
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,645
Could you FaceTime
me when he plays?

159
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,952
- Not me.
- Not the Secret Service.

160
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,127
Don't.

161
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,824
I'm trying to
explain what you saw.

162
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,870
I didn't see anything.

163
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,222
All right.

164
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,096
Just FaceTime me, please.

165
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,098
Yeah.

166
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,545
How are you doing, dear?

167
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,070
Good.

168
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,204
I'll have them to
you in an hour.

169
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:16,817
What happened with
the Klein bat mitzvah?

170
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:20,037
Oh, the one with
the pop-up Torahs?

171
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,954
- They were a week late.
- Yeah, but she loved them.

172
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:27,741
She didn't really have
a choice, did she?

173
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:30,918
Is everything okay?

174
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:35,575
We need to talk about Megan.

175
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,360
Oh, God. That wasn't on her.

176
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,231
- I'm gonna make some changes.
- No, no, no.

177
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:41,731
I was just going through
some personal stuff.

178
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,583
That was totally my fault.

179
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,848
She's getting promoted.

180
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,851
Oh. To what?

181
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,897
Shift manager.

182
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,294
Isn't that my job?

183
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,777
- You're a wonderful mother.
- Spend more time at home.

184
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,866
They grow up so fast.

185
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,651
- My husband's out of work.
- I really need this job.

186
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,566
I need someone I can rely on.

187
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,742
- Megan's in 11th grade.

188
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,223
Sweetie, it's just a job.

189
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:17,051
Oh, Dorothy.

190
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:20,141
It is so much more than that.

191
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:26,147
I'm gonna need you to
clean out your craft cubby.

192
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:33,458
.

193
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,808
I still don't get it.

194
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,461
What's there to get?

195
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,396
Well, how are they supposed
to know who they want to marry

196
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,856
if they can't see each other?

197
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,207
- That's literally the point.
- But they're blind.

198
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,471
For four episodes, she
thought this show was

199
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,649
about blind people dating?

200
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,390
- It's not?
- Thank you.

201
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,871
What is wrong with y'all?

202
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:58,440
We have bigger issues right
now than Amber and Barnett.

203
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:01,225
Yeah. Jessica won't hump Mark.

204
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,445
You know, I don't see why.

205
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,752
- She can't see anything.
- Excuse me.

206
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,493
We don't have anywhere
to print, guys.

207
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,280
- Can't we just sneak in?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,151
Middle of the night,
do one big run.

209
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,936
Because it's never one.

210
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:19,287
- He always wants more.
- So we'll go back.

211
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,767
And she'll change the alarm.

212
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,309
Why don't we just
steal the whole thing?

213
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,596
Hey. Now you're talking.

214
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,470
Okay, and then what do we do
with a two-ton printing press?

215
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:31,429
Well, we put it in your garage.

216
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:32,735
So Mrs. Karpinski

217
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,346
can just drop in and
borrow the leaf blower?

218
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,230
What's she
gonna do, call a Mountie?

219
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,786
Or my kids walk in, and
Mom's printing cash.

220
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,310
Yeah, I can see that
that could be a problem.

221
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,790
I got a place.

222
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,315
Let's just get another
storage unit, you know?

223
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:51,058
Electricity,
drainage, ventilation.

224
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:53,060
- Calm down.
- Guys.

225
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,497
Not to mention space. Privacy.

226
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,325
It's called a
brainstorming sesh.

227
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,545
I know where we can do it.

228
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,635
Where?

229
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,073
- Strip club.
- It's still shut down.

230
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,857
Can Stan get us in?

231
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,732
What do we have to
do to convince him?

232
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,952
Not "we."

233
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,786
What?

234
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,527
We have a Philly
cheesesteak special.

235
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,789
That'll come on an onion roll.

236
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,878
Choice of side.
Fries or coleslaw.

237
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:31,751
I think we need
a couple minutes.

238
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,231
I'll set you up
with some waters.

239
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:43,501
- Want to share something?
- The answer's no.

240
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,329
Or just get your own.

241
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,941
I'm not putting my neck
out on the line for you.

242
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,856
It's not just for me.

243
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,921
I don't want my wife in
anything else you got going.

244
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,251
Well, it's a little
late for that.

245
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,560
Ready to order?

246
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:01,693
- She's on her own.
- Couple more minutes.

247
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,177
This guy doesn't care
about what you want.

248
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,006
- Find some place else, okay?
- There is nowhere else.

249
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,616
Beth.

250
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,750
The less you and I gotta deal
with each other, the better.

251
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,708
You think he's just gonna
let us off the hook,

252
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,971
'cause you're pissed at me?

253
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,147
I think you gotta worry
about your family,

254
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,714
and I gotta worry about mine.

255
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,021
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,375
Is that what you want to hear?

257
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,945
What for?

258
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,518
What you sorry for?

259
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,831
I am sorry...

260
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:57,575
That you feel that I have...

261
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:04,017
Somehow put your family in a

262
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,022
not-ideal situation.

263
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,632
Okay. All right.

264
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,156
Let me... let me
try this one on.

265
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:17,421
So, you're sorry that I
feel you should be sorry?

266
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,989
- What else do you want?
- I want you to mean it.

267
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,689
Okay.

268
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,954
I am sorry.

269
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,869
Better.

270
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm sorry that what I got your
wife into makes her happy.

271
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:36,808
Oh, that's how you
gonna play this?

272
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,878
Not to mention, pays your bills.

273
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,930
You know what I want?

274
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,978
Please.

275
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:56,678
I want you out of her life.

276
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,080
Okay.

277
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,952
Okay?

278
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:16,045
You get us in that club, and
she'll never see me again.

279
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,570
Maid of honor.

280
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,442
Oh, I know.

281
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,401
You just gonna give all that up?

282
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,797
Dean's facing 20 to 30.

283
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,583
Can't stick around for a trial.

284
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,462
What looks good, folks?

285
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,949
We'll share the chili fries.

286
00:15:56,825 --> 00:16:00,176
And Sea Kelp
Moisturizer is up 50%.

287
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,351
- All right!
- Nice.

288
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,546
All right, now,
guys, we got to push

289
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,920
the Spot Fading Serums
though, all right?

290
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,357
Maybe they'd sell if they
didn't smell like ass.

291
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:13,102
Active ingredients.

292
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,148
Smell means what?

293
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,411
It's working.

294
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:21,023
Right. It's a joke.

295
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,503
I like jokes.

296
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,592
You know what else is a joke?

297
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,072
Your numbers.

298
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:30,424
- It's just one month.
- Till it's two.

299
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,427
Then three. Then four.

300
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,255
Then you're flat on your face.

301
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,952
I'm on it.

302
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,041
What happens if he
isn't on it, fellas?

303
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,043
All: We pick him up!

304
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,481
What's holding you back?

305
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:48,050
Uh... thing with
Jules' mom again.

306
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,791
How long she want
to stay this time?

307
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,272
She bought a one-way ticket.

308
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,230
- Ugh.
- Boy.

309
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:08,505
- What's he gotta do, fellas?
- All: Stand up!

310
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:12,640
Evolution has given us
the ability to stand up.

311
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,295
We stand up for our families.

312
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,124
Stand up for our community.

313
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,864
Stand up when we pee.

314
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,997
- It's not that easy.

315
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,261
Then let's do it together.

316
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,006
- Yeah.
- Attaboy, Cory!

317
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:35,793
Now you go home

318
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,839
- and you stand up to Jules.
- Yeah.

319
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,493
- Strong sales.
- All: Strong hearts.

320
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,451
There we go.

321
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,757
Dean.

322
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,194
You put up some solid
numbers this week.

323
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,806
Thanks.

324
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,331
Let's keep it that way.

325
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,811
What's going on with you?

326
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,120
- I'm fine.
- You don't get slapped

327
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,253
with an ankle bracelet
by being fine.

328
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,519
Look, I love selling
the products.

329
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,956
They're great. It's just

330
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,265
you know, all this, it's
just not really my thing.

331
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,098
- All right.
- Let's wrap it up, fellas.

332
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,926
Strong sales. All:
Strong hearts.

333
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,283
Hey, Dean?

334
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:36,202
- No pressure.
- Cool.

335
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,639
Do you really want
to make it here?

336
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,641
I mean, yeah.

337
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,906
You're gonna need all
the help you can get.

338
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,210
Hi.

339
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,824
Excuse me.

340
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,440
Any idea where,
uh, your friend is?

341
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,485
Who, Kevin?

342
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,662
Kevin. Thank you.

343
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,796
- Oh, hey.
- You're all out of shampoo.

344
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,364
That was a brand-new bottle.

345
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:55,803
Yeah, you know, we
were all pretty gnarly.

346
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,462
Can I speak with you
outside for a moment?

347
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,290
Yeah.

348
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,644
- I thought I said no parties.
- I know.

349
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,863
Well, then, what
the hell is that?

350
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,822
It's laundry club.

351
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,476
That is not a thing.

352
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,521
Well, not for the homed.

353
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:21,176
- Okay, you know what?
- This is not gonna work.

354
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,874
- It's only once a month.
- No, no.

355
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:27,269
This, this. You here, with us.

356
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:30,620
Well, I have no
place else to go.

357
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:33,667
Can't you bunk
with that old man?

358
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,452
- Oh, no.
- Murphy's super private.

359
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,586
It's just... it's too weird.

360
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:44,373
- Just give it a chance.
- It's too weird for my son.

361
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,419
Well, I'm his guardian.

362
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,072
On paper.

363
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:55,254
Yeah. Fine.

364
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:58,866
I'll, uh...

365
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,217
Yeah, I'll go get my stuff.

366
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,740
Thank you.

367
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,265
And, yeah, I'll let
the school know.

368
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,875
Whoa, whoa.

369
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,269
Let the school know what?

370
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:14,229
I'm no longer your
domestic partner.

371
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:18,015
- You can't do that.
- Well, I can't lie.

372
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,582
I mean, you can.

373
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,758
But I'm not gonna.

374
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:25,196
- It's for my kid.
- Sorry.

375
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,417
It's just too weird.

376
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:41,082
That woman could only
own a paper store.

377
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,172
Mm, I don't know.

378
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,348
Name literally anything else.

379
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:49,003
- Christmas tree farm.
- Same diff.

380
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,658
Or like a jam store in Vermont.

381
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:52,659
I mean something
that wouldn't be

382
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:54,965
in a Lifetime movie.

383
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,316
- Okay, then I don't know.
- Mm.

384
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:05,411
Okay. Let's go.

385
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,519
Kind of have a weird thing
going on with the neighbors.

386
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,893
- Yeah.
- So, the quicker, the better.

387
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,373
And quieter.

388
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,114
We'd do it during
business hours,

389
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,725
but the new model arrives in
the morning, you know, so.

390
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,946
And we really gotta hit
the ground running, right?

391
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,556
'Cause Mother's Day, graduation,

392
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,341
I mean, they're all
right around the corner.

393
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,952
- Oh, Father's Day.
- Can't leave out the dads.

394
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,867
Gonna stop you right there.

395
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,306
- We have cash.
- We're not doing this.

396
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,655
A lot of cash.

397
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,875
It's not the money.

398
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:35,963
Okay, you know what?

399
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,182
I'm just gonna be real with you.

400
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,663
We are straight-up
stealing this thing.

401
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,902
You don't need to know
the why, but just know

402
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,667
that our life kind
of depends on it.

403
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,496
And you can waste time
with morality, that's fine.

404
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,193
But just know that
you are looking at

405
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:54,373
three mostly good moms
who really need your help.

406
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:59,116
We don't have a problem
with any of that.

407
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,206
Thing just won't fit.

408
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,513
It's too big. It won't
go through the door.

409
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,520
But if you got anything
smaller you want to steal,

410
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,087
we cool with that.

411
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:19,441
.

412
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,312
- How'd it get in here?
- Maybe they built

413
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,011
the building around it.

414
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:29,364
This ancient machine from
Germany was just sitting here.

415
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,540
Maybe.

416
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,499
In a field.

417
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,676
- Maybe.
- Until Dorothy

418
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:40,201
stumbles upon it and decides...

419
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:42,377
Card shop.

420
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,813
Maybe.

421
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,859
Someone must have put it
together piece by piece.

422
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,295
Well, can't we find that guy?

423
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,036
How?

424
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,559
Well, who services it?

425
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,126
- Repair guy.
- Okay.

426
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:53,344
So, we find that guy, and...

427
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,172
Who knows Dorothy.

428
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,827
Then can we just get
somebody who's, like, handy?

429
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,482
- At this hour?
- There are apps.

430
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,441
What, TaskRabbit?

431
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,834
There are others.

432
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:07,184
- What's it like inside there?
- Guys.

433
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:10,187
- The Earth still round?
- Is the sky even blue?

434
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,885
Dean.

435
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,018
You think he could do it?

436
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,412
He took apart our
dishwasher last week.

437
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,936
I guess this is kind
of like an appliance.

438
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,677
Would he?

439
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:28,336
So, how do we convince him?

440
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,556
Not "we."

441
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,734
Honey, wake up. Come on.

442
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:37,345
- What's going on?
- Come on, I need your help.

443
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,409
- Now?
- Yeah, it can't wait.

444
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:39,521
I'm sorry.

445
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,610
- Is it the kids?
- No.

446
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:42,829
Is it my mom?

447
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,700
No. I need your toolbox.

448
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:48,530
- Oh, it's the toilet again.
- No.

449
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,750
Well, what is it?

450
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,666
Dean.

451
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,543
No.

452
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:03,502
Listen.

453
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,721
No.

454
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,637
This is the only way we're
gonna turn this around.

455
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,988
How does helping him help me?

456
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,555
Because if I keep
him in business,

457
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,776
he won't notice what
I'm doing on the side.

458
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,604
What are you doing
on the side now?

459
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,649
I am saving up.

460
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:23,478
- For my lawyer?
- To run.

461
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,262
- Where?
- I don't care,

462
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:28,048
as long as they can't find us.

463
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:31,747
- I'd rather have a lawyer.
- You would need

464
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:35,534
the entire bar association
to save you now.

465
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,628
I'll get my tools.

466
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,076
What?

467
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,820
Um.

468
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,822
Could you guys give us a minute?

469
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,999
But my pulp's gonna dry.

470
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,656
Let's check out the pole.

471
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,449
How's it going?

472
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,103
Almost there.

473
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,238
Thank you.

474
00:27:55,282 --> 00:28:00,156
I never realized what
went into all of this.

475
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,897
Yeah.

476
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,832
I mean, it took a second
for us to find our groove.

477
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,945
It's impressive.

478
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,818
Yeah?

479
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:14,954
And... terrifying.

480
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,049
Why?

481
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:26,661
When we get to
where we're going,

482
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,185
how do I know he won't be there?

483
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,016
I'm not gonna forward our mail.

484
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,108
Like, how... how do I know
he's not gonna be in your head?

485
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:42,459
Because

486
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:46,246
he never belonged there
in the first place.

487
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,249
And what about all of this?

488
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:52,556
What about it?

489
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,168
What's gonna replace it?

490
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:02,044
You. And the kids.

491
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,841
Where are you going?

492
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:21,977
We've never made you smile
like all this just did.

493
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,110
You have to finish.

494
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,329
- Why?
- Because I told you,

495
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:27,678
this is what gets us out.

496
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,768
No, that's what gets you off.

497
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:35,034
This whole time, I thought
he was the problem.

498
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,214
He's just the excuse.

499
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:51,659
.

500
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,879
- What does it look like?
- Even if we find it,

501
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,202
how are we gonna
put it together?

502
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,838
We can figure out five pieces.

503
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:00,320
- It's not like it's 50.
- Okay, does it look like this?

504
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:03,497
- Kind of.
- Okay, or more like this?

505
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,457
- Kind of.
- Just get both.

506
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,156
Uh.

507
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,549
Mm. It's in Germany.

508
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,903
You gotta talk to him.

509
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,469
What's there to say anymore?

510
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:21,863
What'd you say to Stan?

511
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,912
I just told him what
he wanted to hear.

512
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:29,349
Then do the same.

513
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:31,917
Mm.

514
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,269
Really, really sucks
to be you this week.

515
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,709
Hey, hey, hey.

516
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,625
- What are you doing?
- Yo, this is super fly.

517
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:46,801
- That is not yours.
- Like, the Tesla

518
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,890
- of lacrosse sticks.
- Give it back.

519
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,371
Oh, oh, oh!

520
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,372
- Score!
- Stop.

521
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,416
Okay, that is enough.

522
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,567
That's enough, that's enough.

523
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,810
I can't take it anymore, okay?

524
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,377
I'm relocating you.

525
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,900
- Huh?
- Yeah.

526
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,684
I'm gonna lease you a house.

527
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,079
- For real?
- Yep.

528
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:06,560
On wheels.

529
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,691
See?

530
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,215
It's got a shower
and a fold-out bed,

531
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,583
and it gets 14
miles to the gallon,

532
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,479
and there's a stove.

533
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:14,960
- How can you afford that?
- I can't.

534
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,415
But I also can't
afford to have my son

535
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,920
be kicked out of his school.

536
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:23,055
Oh. You want me out that bad.

537
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,622
I never wanted you in.

538
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,978
Well, uh...

539
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:37,939
Yeah, if we're being honest...

540
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,810
Please.

541
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,338
I kind of just assumed
he was a little dick.

542
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,427
My son?

543
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,866
You know, he goes to
some fancy-ass school.

544
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,434
He has a bathroom.

545
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,437
But now that I've hung with him,

546
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,962
he's, like, a regular dude.

547
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:04,052
Thanks, I think.

548
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,359
Yeah, that school
could probably use

549
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,491
someone dope like him.

550
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,539
That's why I gotta
do whatever it takes.

551
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,155
You know what, just, uh

552
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:24,507
yeah, you can forget
about the home on wheels.

553
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:28,947
What are you gonna want instead?

554
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,993
Oh, just keep him in lacrosse.

555
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:35,736
You know, don't let him
become some theater kid.

556
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,478
Where are you gonna live?

557
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,436
With Murphy.

558
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,482
I thought he was too private.

559
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:43,845
I snagged him a refrigerator box

560
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,834
from Best Boy, so he owes me.

561
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,357
Gotcha.

562
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,055
Uh...

563
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:55,147
Can I put on Maddow
while I pack?

564
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,583
Sure.

565
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,455
It's real, people...

566
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,849
The stain-fighting
power of OxiClean.

567
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,111
It's how I did the towels.

568
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,678
Looks like the
stain is coming out.

569
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,114
When the OxiClean started to...

570
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,768
Corporate has given us an extra

571
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,509
3% margin on all of these.

572
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:10,989
- Mm, cha-ching.
- Yep.

573
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,531
So let's get them out there
as fast as possible, huh?

574
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,861
Rosehips!

575
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,317
Pair it with the
Restorative Night Cream.

576
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:16,995
- Great add-on.
- Yeah, but do we

577
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,736
use it before or
after the Face Wash?

578
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,105
- I don't know, Cory.
- You're gonna wash off

579
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:24,524
$90 face cream right
after you put it on?

580
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,005
I robbed a greeting card store.

581
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:35,665
What's that, Dean?

582
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:39,060
I stole a printing press.

583
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,500
Is that how you
got the bracelet?

584
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:47,895
That's

585
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:51,159
because my wife was
laundering a gang's money

586
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,074
through my business.

587
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:58,427
Yeah, but what'd you
need the press for?

588
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,953
She uses it to make counterfeit.

589
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,007
What happened to her?

590
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,099
Not a damn thing.

591
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:22,451
And you're the one
in the bracelet.

592
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,109
I owed her.

593
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,720
That's a big-time debt.

594
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:36,161
I messed up big time.

595
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,467
Girl at work?

596
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:42,297
More than just one of them.

597
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,128
- Still going on?
- God, no, it was forever ago.

598
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,218
What's manslaughter get you, Z?

599
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,307
Good behavior?

600
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,700
A few years, tops.

601
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,137
- I didn't murder anyone.
- Exactly.

602
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:59,184
You just put your
penis in some strange.

603
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:03,884
- Human nature, bro.
- People make mistakes.

604
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:08,628
She doesn't feel that way.

605
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:11,674
Then you gotta let it go.

606
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,683
I don't know that I can.

607
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:23,817
Johnny, give me the key.

608
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,907
- Whoo! All right.

609
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,649
Come on. Come with me.

610
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,259
Gotta get up, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

611
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,174
Come on.

612
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,482
Right over here. Right here.

613
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,179
Stay right here.

614
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:44,185
Come on, Dean.

615
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:47,188
Don't let her keep
you behind those bars.

616
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,537
Come on, buddy.

617
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:51,192
There you go. Come on.

618
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:53,194
That's right.

619
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:59,200
It's okay, it's okay.

620
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,724
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

621
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,172
You're free.

622
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:18,176
Free.

623
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,096
.

624
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,056
- Dad!
- I'm in here, bud.

625
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,101
I got one goal and one assist.

626
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:34,017
What? Nice!

627
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:36,194
That's amazing.

628
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,413
Come on, go get in the bath.

629
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,248
Tried to FaceTime you.

630
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:49,816
Eh, I was busy.

631
00:36:55,822 --> 00:37:00,740
I can't promise you
that I won't get bored.

632
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,963
Or.

633
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:11,229
Think it might be fun to
hit a grocery store again.

634
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:20,107
But at least we'll have a shot.

635
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,330
'Cause if we stay here,
nothing's gonna change.

636
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,165
You can print.

637
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,559
I finished it.

638
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,347
Why?

639
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,003
I just let it go.

640
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:02,715
D-Man! Give me the recap.

641
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:10,113
- Braid emergency.

642
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:11,550
So you're just
gonna take my job?

643
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:14,422
- You weren't home.
- I got 'em.

644
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:17,164
Work emergency trumps
braid emergency.

645
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:19,035
All right, let me see.

646
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,776
- It's not bad, right?
- Eh,

647
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,301
I don't think Alicia Keys
will be calling you, but...

648
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,868
- Snoop might, though.
- Oh, so now you do LOCS?

649
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,001
Oh, well, you want
to give it a go?

650
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:29,132
I'm all good.

651
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:37,358
How'd it go?

652
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,621
A couple of speed bumps,
but pulled it off.

653
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:42,537
- Okay.
- How long is it gonna take?

654
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:44,626
Till we find somewhere
else, I guess.

655
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,715
All right, now, the city's
gonna put that place

656
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,238
up for auction soon.

657
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:49,892
- What's soon?
- I don't know.

658
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:52,852
You'll know when the
sticker's on the door.

659
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,644
Thanks for making that work.

660
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:05,995
Pssh. I just gave you a key.

661
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,171
I meant with her.

662
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,956
Hmm.

663
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,828
Well, she's your girl.

664
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:15,483
What'd she say to you?

665
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:19,487
- Everything I wanted to hear.

666
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:22,185
What? What's funny?

667
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,579
She said the exact
same thing to me.

668
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,364
Hmm.

669
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:33,545
Hey. Where is he?

670
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:36,548
- He's in the shower.
- Oh, good.

671
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:41,204
Got us all-new peanut butter,

672
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:46,296
mayo, mustard, and soy sauce.

673
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,865
Where is he gonna go?

674
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:53,391
To a lovely DIY duplex.

675
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,046
I used his move today.

676
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,221
What do you mean?

677
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,049
- Rusty gate.
- Eww.

678
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,114
It's this really tough check,
'cause if you do it wrong,

679
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,663
you get a penalty.

680
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,187
- Wait, hang on.
- He taught you a lacrosse move?

681
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,231
He was All-American.

682
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,016
What?

683
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,540
Played for Maryland.

684
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:16,370
Hey, I just need five
more minutes, and I'm out.

685
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,374
Oh, and hey, if you ever want
to work on more defense stuff,

686
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,594
just come by the dumpster
behind the Kroger.

687
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,335
- You still coming to the game?
- Dude, I wouldn't miss it.

688
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,732
Unless I can't find
someone to watch my cart.

689
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,301
Check. Ooh!

690
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:37,260
Benjamin, nice reflexes.

691
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,439
All right.

692
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,918
So, he's back in?

693
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:45,443
- What do you want from me?
- I caved.

694
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,488
What about that bucket?

695
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,405
He held strong.

696
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,581
- Dude.
- Yeah.

697
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:57,411
What's up, ladies?

698
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:01,154
Just business.

699
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,859
You know, you still got it.

700
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,818
It wasn't easy.

701
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,777
That maple leaf is like
four different colors.

702
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:17,257
Cool.

703
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,478
When do you want the rest of it?

704
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,743
I don't.

705
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,530
Why?

706
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,967
My guys can't clean
the Queen here.

707
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:36,276
You said all we had
to do was print it.

708
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,844
Yeah. And then drop it.

709
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:44,502
I assumed that you
meant in our country.

710
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,766
Jesus, not again.

711
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,420
Why can't it ever be Mexico?

712
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:55,164
When?

713
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,688
When I'm ready.

714
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,824
- Avoided it for so long.
- Don't.

715
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:05,827
But I think we all knew
this day would come.

716
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,221
