I call all the shots.

the stuff, Annie.

578

- Is it the homeless guy?
- What?

586
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,965
- Is he, like, making you
sell drugs or something?

587
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:52,491
- No, he's not like that.
He's actually really...

588
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,673
- He stole a dog, Annie.

589

in trouble, right?

597

- How are my finances
any of your business?

598
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:19,343
- Because you have no finances.

599
