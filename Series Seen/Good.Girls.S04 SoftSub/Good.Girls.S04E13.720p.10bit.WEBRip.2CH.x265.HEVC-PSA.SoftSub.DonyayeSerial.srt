2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,625
Stop, stop.
You can't do that.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,959
- Why not?
- Because we're roommates.

4
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:09,960
You remember Angela.
You look great.

5
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:11,408
Why'd they throw
out your case?

6
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:14,046
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't be going home.

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,274
Hey, Shel.
Need something from evidence.

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,352
- So what can I do for you?
- Heard you're the ticket guy.

9
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,179
Sorry.
What was your precinct?

10
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,273
14th.

11
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,358
Hmm.

12
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,484
Get your coat.

13
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,281
- Why?
- 'Cause you'll be cold.

14
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,937
- Gonna wonder where I am.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,476
That's kind of the point.

16
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,129
I want my sister back!

17
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:39,289
Finish the job then.

18
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:41,687
- See you at school.
- Your bags are fake.

19
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,523
- What's this?
- Our offer.

20
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:46,329
- This is way less than I paid.
- Plumbing.

21
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,282
Electrical.
It's all gotta go.

22
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,648
- We're back in the club.
- Whose name is it in?

23
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,585
I need career advice.

24
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,335
You gonna sell out
your own wife?

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,536
It's not like she ever
had my back.

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,797
She's not the only
one in this.

27
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,070
I will protect Ruby.

28
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,180
What if that's not up to you?

29
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:01,492
That's why I have to make
sure it all sticks to Beth.

30
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,179
What do you think, man?

31
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,664
I think I got
something on her.

32
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:12,835
Here's the rest of it.

33
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:20,117
- Weird, right?
- What's that?

34
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:23,460
Being reduced to a box.

35
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:29,046
- Where's his daughter?
- With the ex.

36
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,445
- How's she doing?
- Never been better.

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,481
Really?

38
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,953
Mm-hmm. Random robbery.
Dad gets slaughtered.

39
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,515
She can't wait for Christmas.

40
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,515
None of it's right.

41
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,000
Any leads?

42
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:48,187
Just every dirtbag
with a prior.

43
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:21,445
What are you gonna do?

44
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,839
I have, like, a month
of banked vacay.

45
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:25,611
Aren't you suspended for,
like, three?

46
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:27,125
So I'll get a Peloton after.

47
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,835
Do that before the vacation.

48
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,210
Don't let this die, okay?

49
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,414
Nothing can survive here.

50
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,968
I grabbed your mail, too.

51
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,175
Why didn't I leave Detroit
when you did?

52
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:45,508
'Cause you're not
smart enough

53
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,984
to know it's all pointless.

54
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:51,242
Hey, did Dave say anything
about our last night there?

55
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,187
He, like, made this noise

56
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:56,640
I've actually never heard
a man make.

57
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,015
It was, like, high-pitched.

58
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,515
I think we're gonna go
on vacation,

59
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,734
like, Playa del Carmen.

60
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,870
They like gays, in Puerto Rico.

61
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:07,203
I think he'll like that.

62
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:09,962
How could his wife not know?

63
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,320
She knows?

64

66
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,275
What's that gonna do?

67
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,361
We'd be protected.

68
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:27,089
You'll be protected.

69
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,531
I think the question is

70
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:32,500
how does you being
on city council protect us?

71
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:35,203
Because I'd finally have
some real leverage.

72
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,570
You kind of already do.

73
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,547
How?

74
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:43,321
I mean, he's not gonna mess
with somebody he wants to...

75
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,265
- Don't.
- Fingerpaint.

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,546
- That's gross.
- Pick your lock?

77
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:49,154
Somehow worse.

78
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,723
Give you the double gopher.

79
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,462
I think you see
where we're going with this.

80
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,352
I mean some real leverage,

81
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:56,758
like if he wants to throw you
in a freezer again.

82
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,507
I would have the city
on my side.

83
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,507
What happened to Nevada?

84
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,572
- Nothing.
- 'Cause we wouldn't have

85
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,541
to worry about the freezer
in Nevada, right?

86
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:08,511
Yeah, but I'd like
to get us there in one piece.

87
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,399
- That's a pretty big detour.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,797
You don't really stop in Miami
on your way to Vegas.

89
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,687
Okay. Chill.

90
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,851
Gosh.
It wasn't even my idea.

91
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,804
Whose idea was it?

92
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:26,335
- Brother cousin.
- Hmm.

93
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,354
What?

94
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,250
Okay.

95
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:35,195
That is not
why he suggested it.

96
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:37,343
I mean, isn't it?

97
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:40,312
- He said he could use me.
- Oh, I bet he could.

98
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,570
A mom like me.

99
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:46,679
And I'm guessing
he also has fingers.

100
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:49,210
All right. Forget it.

101
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,414
I'll tell him
to ask someone else.

102
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,617
Sheesh.

103
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,548
There's no one else.

104
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:59,165
No. We don't have to fill
his seat right away,

105
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,165
so why don't you just
take a minute

106
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,742
and, you know,
realize why I'm right?

107
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,562
Okay.
Take longer than a minute.

108
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,414
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
give in easy.

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,650
All right.

110
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:15,000
All right.
Talk to you later. Bye.

111
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,546
Maybe she's just not that
into you, bro.

112
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:24,515
Mm.
She'll come around.

113
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,164
Chicks like that don't need
to be romanced.

114
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,359
Oh, yeah?
What does she need?

115
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,812
Someone to yank her
by that ponytail.

116
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,409
That's not my style,
brother.

117
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:41,983
You want her in that
seat, right?

118
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,726
What would you do?

119
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,382
I'd give her
what she needs.

120
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,984
I know what you need.

121
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,673
What's that?

122
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:02,101
You need to stop
eating this burger.

123
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,710
Yo!

124
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,679
Gotta make weight.

125
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,132
Always want what I already
have, huh?

126
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:12,023
Always get it too.
Mmm!

127
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,018
Ah!

128
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:00,852
Ow, hey, stop, stop.
Annie!

129
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,830
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?

130
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:05,104
I thought you were
breaking in.

131
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:06,590
- My key didn't work.
- Yeah.

132
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:09,399
Well, yeah,
because the lock is broken.

133
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,530
Is that why your entire
kitchen's on the floor?

134
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:14,540
It's my alarm system.

135
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,212
It worked.

136
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,571
Where have you been?

137
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,282
Angela's.

138
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,438
Well, you missed
all the action.

139
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,548
I did all right.

140
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:31,462
I meant here.

141
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:36,946
Wait,
where are you going now?

142
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,802
- Gotta get back.
- Angela could stay here.

143
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,974
I wouldn't want
to break your rules.

144
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:47,169
I'll make an exception.

145
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:52,897
We might order food.

146
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,572
I could also order food.

147
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,673
We could all three watch
a movie or...

148
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:58,575
She asked me to move
in with her.

149
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:01,888
Already?

150
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,732
This my avocado knife?

151
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,050
It's not.

152
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:09,537
- Can I have it?
- Uh...

153
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:15,247
Don't you just think
it might be a little soon?

154
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,875
Dude, it's better
than couch-surfing.

155
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:23,505
Okay. Well, then you can
sleep in my bed.

156
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,466
I mean I'll stay in Ben's room.

157
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:29,966
Why would you do that?

158
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,489
Because we had a deal.

159
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:38,590
Just... tell the school
I still live here.

160
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:43,271
Wait. Please, I...

161
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,427
I don't want to be alone.

162
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:49,881
Neither do I.

163
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:11,881
What's all this?

164
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,279
Need to get 'em out of here.

165
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,076
What about our money?

166
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:20,687
Well, you should have thought
about that before you

167
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,287
and your bestie told Eli's mom
that she bought a fake.

168
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:25,241
- It just came out.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:28,162
Well, it's all over
the parent chain.

170
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,607
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,335
They threatened
to call the cops.

172
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,810
- What did you say?
- It was a mistake.

173
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:39,204
- That's good.
- And I refunded all her money.

174
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,537
Not good.

175
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,264
Well, what else
was I supposed to do?

176
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,623
- This was our way out.
- It was.

177
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,959
And not just for us.

178
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,312
Do you feel that?

179
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:55,092
- What?
- The déjà vu.

180
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:57,673
- This isn't Beth's fault.
- Yeah.

181
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:59,100
You go out with your girl
for one night,

182
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,504
and then you come back with
problems that last you forever.

183
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,022
So we'll find
another way out.

184
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,850
She'll screw that up too.

185
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,568
Goodwill will be here
in the morning.

186
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:14,560
- Stan?
- This one was mine.

187
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,763
It's just like what is
he even doing in there?

188
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,186
Well, he's probably built up
more filth,

189
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,131
because he's been homeless
for so long.

190
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:31,038
He might as well be showering
in Cristal,

191
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:32,420
for what it's costing me.

192
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,888
- What if he took baths?
- He moved out.

193
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:38,623
Problem solved.

194
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,013
Still can't pay
the water bill.

195
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,147
We need another purse party.

196
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,287
Oh, okay.

197
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,240
Check with the girls,
would you?

198
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:49,553
Totally.

199
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,138
Get something on the books.

200
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:55,528
It might...
not be right away.

201
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:57,904
How come?

202
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,792
Just, you know,
some issues.

203
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,506
What kind of issues?

204
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:07,092
Inventory.

205
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,168

210
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,715
So a dealership?

211
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,751
Never really my thing.

212
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:30,480
Spas?
What are those even for?

213
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,396
But this?

214
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,452
This is how
we make dreams come true.

215
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:36,881
Not "we."

216
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:40,358
Public record, darling.

217
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:45,099
- This is ours.
- A little Lysol. Lot of love.

218
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,733
- This is just where we print.
- Clean this place right up.

219
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,772
Not a place to wash.

220
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,998
It is now.

221
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:01,000
We know nothing about
running a strip club.

222
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,804
Didn't know much about cars
or hot tubs either.

223
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,289
How much?

224
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,035
How much what?

225
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,592
Our cut.

226
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,873
Why would I do that?

227
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:26,209
You know how this goes.

228
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,592
How clean do you
want your money?

229
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:33,428
Oh, I want it to sparkle.

230
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:34,764
Then you get
what you pay for.

231
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,133
What are you doing?

232
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,740
Maybe we could work
something out.

233
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,920
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

234
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:01,505
- She's mad.
- We were out.

235
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:05,021
- Not exactly.
- We were more out than in.

236
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,280
You know how you protect us?

237
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,826
By doing exactly what he says.

238
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:13,154
At least now
we're getting paid.

239
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,451
That's what the purses
are for.

240
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:18,842
The purses are gone.

241
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,217
Can't we just make more?

242
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:25,903
Not without getting Harry
kicked out of school.

243
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:27,498
Oh, no.

244
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,374
- What happened?
- I said a thing.

245
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,910
- She said a thing.
- Oh, no.

246
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,451
So without this it is
bye-bye Nevada.

247
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,053
- Hey, bitches.
- Hey.

248
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:41,513
I'm starving.

249
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:46,021
Yo, hey, let me get
a Reuben sandwich, okay,

250
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:48,318
Extra Russian dressing.

251
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,882
What kind of fries you got?

252
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,555
Steak. Skinny. Curly.

253
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,084
Okay.

254
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,529
- Which one?
- All three.

255
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,975
Okay, so we have two parties
coming up,

256
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,471
and we can stick these guys
with at least ten purses.

257
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,935
- Change of plans.
- Okay.

258
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,482
Need you back at the club.

259
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:16,709
- What do you mean?
- It's opening back up.

260
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:21,998
That's not gonna happen.

261
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,326
Why not?

262
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,334
The girls have moved on.

263
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,013
Can't we get 'em back?

264
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:32,717
Oh, no.
Jean treated us like garbage.

265
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:34,849
Oh, well,
there's new management.

266
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,986

All of us.

290
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,296
We'll treat it
like a partnership.

291
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,133
We'll split the costs
and the profits.

292
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,564
So instead of just dancing
on the table...

293
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,154
You'll finally have
a seat at it.

294
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,995
So what do you guys think?

295
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,399
Whoo!

296
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:02,158
Babe, the geraniums don't go
with the snapdragons.

297
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:04,688
I'm just planting everything
that's in the flats, babe.

298
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:07,691
Now we've got purple
on top of lavender.

299
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,331
- So?
- They clash, babe.

300
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:13,136
It's the exact same color.

301
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,303
You are such a dude.

302
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,560
Cowboy.

303
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,597
Sorry.
The gate was open.

304
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,608
Babe, this is Agent Donnegan.

305
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:25,287
She was
with me in Detroit.

306
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:27,612
Thanks for keeping him
in line.

307
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,762
He's a pretty
straight shooter.

308
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,975
Well, my trainer's
on her way.

309
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,131
Babe, just make it look pretty.

310
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,599
I tried to sway the director.

311
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:45,134
It's not your fault.

312
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,177
Yeah, but it was
under my watch.

313
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:48,873
I'm the one lost the money.

314
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,865
You didn't lose it.

315
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,357
You just got played.

316
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:56,021
I'll be okay.

317
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,904
I wish there was something
more I could do.

318
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,779
There is.

319
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,162
Can you help me water here?

320
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,373
Come with me.

321
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:19,404
Where you going?

322
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,279
Detroit.

323
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,499
- You're off the clock.
- It's my vacation.

324
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:35,711
They'll never authorize this.

325
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,650
- They will for you.
- We lost, kid.

326
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:39,961
That's 'cause
we didn't connect the dots.

327
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:41,356
This is for someone else.

328
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,786
It's not just about money.

329
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,905
It's not even our
jurisdiction there.

330
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,229
He's got the entire city
in his pocket,

331
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,279
and you're just
gonna plant petunias?

332
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:51,444
- Geraniums.
- Well, they're beautiful.

333
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,584
Thank you.

334
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,077
With a garden like that,
who cares that he slaughtered

335
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:59,302
a cop, card store girl,
and a team of federal agents?

336
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,092
You need a real vacation.

337
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:05,796
And you need to separate
the purple ones, babe.

338
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,845
I found this...
in my underwear a while ago.

339
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,381
Wow.

340
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,792
Look at the quality.

341
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,697
I didn't touch it,
so those are all her prints.

342
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:29,194
- Sweet.
- Yeah, I...

343
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,232
I got this
from my wife's cell.

344
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,842
They're just talking about
going to a book club.

345
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,712
No. It's code.

346
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:43,201
Yeah. Nobody was doing
any reading.

347
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,241
So we made a whole list,
right,

348
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:46,188
with timestamps, you know.

349
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:47,866
See, it correlates with
when she left

350
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,193
in the middle of the night.

351
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:51,921
- Making her drops.
- Maybe we can use the towers.

352
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,527
You know, however they do that.
They use the towers.

353
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,631
Maybe that's how you
track the money.

354
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,276
I mean is that enough?

355
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,123
It's up to the DA.

356
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,287
Wait.

357
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:09,771
What's gonna happen to her?

358
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,318
Everything that never should
have happened to you.

359
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:21,256
It's the right thing, D.

360
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,685
It's easy for you to say.
It's not your wife.

361
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:28,506
She brought it
on herself.

362
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,951
Listen to this guy.

363
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:40,211
He knows what's up.

364
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,232
I mean I'm just trying
to help out a friend.

365
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,427
You're gonna fit in great
with the team.

366
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,139
How's that?

367
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,624
You got your territory
all set.

368
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,859
Yeah.
You can work under Dean,

369
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,513
till you get
the program down.

370
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:56,693
I'm not looking
for a career change.

371
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,013
No, no. That's the wrong way
to think about it.

372
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,686
Yeah.
No disrespect.

373
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:16,335
The night renewal cream is
really flying off the shelves.

374
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:20,896
Let's not talk shop
in front of tourists.

375
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,718
No disrespect.

376
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,740
It's all good.

377
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:34,717
Ahh

378
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,010
When are you gonna get
that lock fixed?

379
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:56,818
- Why are you home?
- I live here.

380
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,716
But you have the tournament.

381
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,705
- Yeah.
- Oh.

382
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,552
So you guys need, like,
a chaperone or...

383
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,622
- Dad's doing it.
- Oh.

384
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,763
What about a water girl?

385
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,779
What's going on?

386
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:23,092
What? Nothing.

387
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,584
Ever get the feeling
you're gonna be

388
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:30,981
kidnapped and murdered?

389
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,323
I'm gonna skip
the tournament.

390
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,008
- No, no, no.
- It's one game.

391
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,961
It's the semifinals.

392
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:40,217
Why don't you stay
with Aunt Beth?

393
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,894
Ugh. 'Cause those kids
wake up at, like, 8:00.

394
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:44,264
Rather get murdered.

395
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:45,699
Where'd Kevin go?

396
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,503
His girlfriend.

397
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,240
Well, where's
Martha gonna go?

398
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:50,572
Who?

399
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,002
His friend with the green
shopping cart.

400
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,522
- How do you know her?
- Martha and Tom come over

401
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,279
to do laundry
when you're at work.

402
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:59,078
Of course they do.

403
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:02,749
Rollerblade Roy just chills
and watches Maddow sometimes.

404
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:04,982
The rest of 'em crash behind
the food court, at the mall.

405
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,753
They throw out
everything there.

406
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,360
Panda Express.
Steak Escape.

407
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:12,927
Wetzel's Pretzels.
Hot Dog on a Stick.

408
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:22,967
I think I finally figured
out this bedtime thing.

409
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,474
Only took four kids.

410
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:26,296
Promise 'em anything
they want,

411
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,445
and they go to sleep
with a smile on their face.

412
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,014
And what happens
when they wake up?

413
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,685
They've forgotten everything.

414
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:33,748
So you lie.

415
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,818
- I'm open to suggestions.
- Maybe try holding a pillow

416
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,388
over their cute little face,
till they pass out.

417
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:43,085
Wow.
Let me know how that goes.

418
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,271
I'm on mornings, so...

419
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:50,787
Well, I might be working
more nights, from now on.

420
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,295
Why?

421
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:58,123
He's just throwing a lot
at us, these days.

422
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,677
All right.

423
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:03,396
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

424
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:07,412
Thanks.

425
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,123
Don't miss too many bedtimes.

426
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:17,084
You never know
how many you got left.

427
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:20,756
They don't grow up that fast.

428
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,256
Reservation?

429
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,748
Angela, right?

430
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,774
Sorry. Annie.
I'm Kevin's old roommate.

431
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,512
Oh, my God. Hi.

432
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:37,139
Hey. I'm sorry
to bother you at work.

433
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:38,449
I just... I couldn't get
a hold of him.

434
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:39,714
Oh, he's probably
at my place.

435
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:41,569
Oh, yeah. Of course.
Makes sense.

436
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,804
It's just, you know, with his
phone number always changing,

437
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,951
'cause the prepaid phones
and all that.

438
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,615
- He uses those?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,537
That or the payphone
at the bus station

440
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:52,421
which he swears
still works, but...

441
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:55,974
- Gross.
- Yeah. Oh, speaking of, here.

442
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,921
Yeah. He left this behind.

443
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:02,086
- What is that?
- His bathroom.

444
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,884
- He poops in there?
- Oh, yeah.

445
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,677
Poops. Showers.
Shaves. The works.

446
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,977
- He can use my bathroom.
- You know Kev.

447
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,641
Creature of habit.

448
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:19,120
Oh, he also forgot
to take these.

449
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:23,219
Condiments?
I have all this stuff.

450
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:26,073
In my experience,
you're gonna want to double up.

451
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:28,985
Why?

452
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,415
Well, you know he doesn't
believe in silverware,

453
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,229
so when you combine that
with the bucket

454
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:35,805
it just gets a little dicey.

455
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,000
Why are you doing this?

456
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:46,010
Just... to help you prepare.

457
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:49,696
Or maybe you're jealous,

458
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,618
or, like, lonely,
or just, like, psycho.

459
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:56,236
Okay. I'm cool with Kevin.

460
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:59,383
- That's great.
- I like that he's different.

461
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,485
Hey, he's all yours.

462
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:04,994
Thanks.

463
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,576
- ATM.
- Check.

464
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,345
- Liquor vendors.
- Check.

465
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,613
- Dry cleaning.
- Jean put in coin-op machines.

466
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:17,713
We'll set up an account.

467
00:25:17,797 --> 00:25:20,188
- Trash removal.
- Underway.

468
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,173
How are you on diapers?

469
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:24,687
This one just had
a major blowout.

470
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,216
Okay.
I'll make sure you're stocked.

471
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,000
- Health insurance forms.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,758
Make sure all the girls
get one of those.

473
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,344
Some ladies outside want
to talk to the managers.

474
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:39,492
Can we help you?

475
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,321
We're here about the dancing.

476
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,469
Oh. Auditions are Tuesday.

477
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:46,992
Fully nude?

478
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,943
We leave that up
to the performer.

479
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:53,289
Do you know how many kids
ride their bikes past here

480
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,703
every single day?

481
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:58,955
We're fully zoned
and licensed.

482
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:01,055
Not anymore.

483
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:07,338
There's enough there
to keep you from opening.

484
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,961
It's your turn
in the freezer.

485
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:35,610
Don't need a turndown.
Thanks.

486
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:42,039
Haven't left my bed
since the last turndown.

487
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:44,141
Not housekeeping.

488
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,711
Took me
three flights to get here.

489
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:55,399
- Why?
- I use miles.

490
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,969
- Why?
- We're both on vacation.

491
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:10,227
You better give me
money for that.

492
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:12,762
It's mine too.

493
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:13,992
How?

494
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,024
We're roommates.

495
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,360
Department chief can't spring
for his own room?

496
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,332
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

497
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:24,383
My funds are limited.

498
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,297
My wife left me.

499
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,797
This is all you got, huh?

500
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,310
What happened?

501
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:35,501
We're still gonna have
to track a motive.

502
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,234
No. Why did she leave?

503
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:45,468
I told her that I like
a more diverse garden.

504
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,304
So what now?

505
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:55,250
We get him.

506
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,679
I fart in my sleep.

507
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:13,632
I watch an unhealthy
amount of porn.

508
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,664
We're gonna be just fine.

509
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:26,132
What is Family
First Alliance?

510
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,297
Not a group you want
on your bad side.

511
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:32,171
Women have been naked
in that dump for over a decade.

512
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:34,107
Yeah. Well, when
ownership transfers...

513
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:35,688
But it's the same place.

514
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,547
The community has a say
about it.

515
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:40,632
- I don't even want to do this.
- Then don't.

516
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:44,150
Oh, sure, so your brother can
come for the rest of my family.

517
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,851
Not my brother.

518
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,109
What is he exactly?

519
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:51,898
Blood.

520
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:57,500
Well, you are
my elected official.

521
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,918
So?

522
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:01,007
So you're supposed
to be helpful.

523
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,024
You want this problem
to go away?

524
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,101
Yes, please.

525
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:05,820
Then run for city council.

526
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:07,712
I'm just a mom.

527
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:09,297
I was just a caddie.

528
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:13,273
Well, what's a plain,
old mom supposed to do?

529
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:16,625
- Fight.
- How?

530
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:20,549
Studies show crime goes up
around a strip club.

531
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:24,289
Assault, random victimization,
drunk driving,

532
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,922
and public indecency.

533
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:30,493
This is what we live in fear of
when we take our dog for a walk

534
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:34,332
or our kids to a school that is
right around the corner.

535
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,268
What crawled up her butt?

536
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:40,404
We ask you tonight to restore
family values to our community

537
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:45,023
and to finally shut down
this lawless den of sin.

538
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,812
Thank you.

539
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,906
Anyone else like to speak
on this matter?

540
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:08,522
Okay.
If there are no objections,

541
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,764
- we'll move to vote...
- Just a second.

542
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,341
Someone still has the floor.

543
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:17,036
Yes. I'd like to read
a statement I've prepared.

544
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,802
Oh, boy.

545
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,655
From the oldest of times,
people danced

546
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,482
for a number of reasons.

547
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:32,863
They danced in prayer,

548
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:36,443
or so that their crops
would be plentiful,

549
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,037
or so that their hunt...

550
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:39,656
- Is she doing "Footloose"?
<i>- Would be good.</i>

551
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,068
I couldn't talk her
out of it.

552
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:43,334
It worked for Bacon.

553
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:46,001
They danced to stay
physically fit and show

554
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,004
their community spirit,
and they danced...

555
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:50,897
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

556
00:30:56,556 --> 00:30:59,218
I would also like to respond
to what the woman

557
00:30:59,303 --> 00:31:03,619
from Families First said.

558
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:08,607
I respect that you're a mother.
I am also a mother.

559
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:14,888
In fact, we're all mothers,
right, Krystal?

560
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,500
I drop my first-grader
off at that school

561
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,636
right around the corner,
before I go to the club.

562
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:23,318
My little girl's
in third grade there.

563
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,146
My son's in college.

564
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,676
Boy, she looks incredible.

565
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,786
We are all just trying
to make a living.

566
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
There's a lot of other ways
to do that.

567
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:37,865
Fine, but...

568
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:42,091
do they all benefit
our economy the way ours does?

569
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,560
Is Mr. Samborski here?

570
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:46,596
- Right here.
- This is Mr. Samborski.

571
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,533
He owns the 24-hour donut shop
right next to the club.

572
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,944
My sales between 2:00
and 5:00 a.m.

573
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,274
have gone way down,
since Sweet P's closed.

574
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:56,278
That's one business.

575
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:58,347
I own a jewelry store.

576
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:01,786
When Sweet P's was open,
we did so much better.

577
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:05,553
Husbands are way more generous
with their wives

578
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:08,024
when they feel guilty.

579
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,701
The guys always pre-game
at my sports bar.

580
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:12,006
We need to get those girls

581
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,458
to take their
clothes off again.

582
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:16,296
See? Whether they're
dancing in a club,

583
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,003
or speaking in a board room,
or baking in a kitchen,

584
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:23,303
these women are making
a difference in our community.

585
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:28,872
And aren't those values just as
important to show our children?

586
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:37,078
Well, thank you for listening.

587
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,693
Whoo!

588
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:43,719
How'd I do?

589
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,045
You brought home the Bacon.

590
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,599
Next up, after the vote,

591
00:32:51,118 --> 00:32:53,729
ordinance 0.682.

592
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:56,204
The length of retractable
dog leashes.

593
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:58,090
Ooh, I gotta hear this.

594
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:06,214
Open for business.

595
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,549
- Congrats. So exciting.
- Thanks, baby.

596
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:15,560
- Thank you.
- Yes. Whoo!

597
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:21,935
Huh, so what
should we toast to?

598
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:25,068
To our new venture.

599
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:28,951
Most of which we give to the
man who put you in a freezer.

600
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,076
Why are we even celebrating?

601
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,818
Hey, guys.

602
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:39,396
Miss us?

603
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,716
What's all that?

604
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:50,529
Redemption.

605
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,966
Huh?

606
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,724
We are ice cream
social chairs,

607
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,272
running a car wash thing,

608
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:59,669
a holiday boutique,
concert committee.

609
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:02,833
Is that enough to keep
the cops away?

610
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,294
Well, it's enough
to keep him in that school.

611
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,974
- The car wash is all you.
- Yeah.

612
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,724
What's all that?

613
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,302
Putting in a spice rack.

614
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,638
Hell no.

615
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:25,607
Oh, I'm not getting on it.

616
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:28,850
But who... hell to the no.

617
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:30,522
I think it's fun!

618
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:31,420
For you.

619
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,092
My own private
champagne room.

620
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:35,138
So what am I?
A piece of meat?

621
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:37,286
Tonight, no.
Tonight...

622
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:42,115
- you're a fireman.
- Oh.

623
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:43,839
Wait,
where'd you even get this?

624
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:46,264
We replaced the old ones.

625
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:50,029
What's going on, baby?

626
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,083
We're opening the club
back up.

627
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:57,391
- Who's "we?"
- All of us.

628
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,740
Me, the girls,
even the dancers.

629
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,849
Okay yeah.
You can't do that.

630
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,130
Before you get weird,

631
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:10,052
I'm just as much an owner
as Beth is.

632
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:15,148
- Ruby.
- This is our new way out.

633
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,229
We don't even need the bags.

634
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:21,411
Is this a done deal?

635
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:23,911
We're legit.

636
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:28,087
There might even be
a job in it for you.

637
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:29,703
For me?

638
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,889
<i>Chiiild's "Back To Life"</i>

639
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:55,350
Who's next? Dennis.
Tyler.

640
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:58,782
What do we look for?
We look for weaknesses, right?

641
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,388
Let's go!

642
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:03,662
There you go. No retreat.
No surrender, Tyler.

643
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,195
He's bigger,
but you might be better.

644
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:07,296
Tyler, don't back up.
Get in there.

645
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:08,944
Dennis, attack!

646
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:10,029
Good.

647
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,599
All right.

648
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:14,894
Let's take a break.

649
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:16,541
Dennis, help Tyler up.

650
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,167
Caleb, that's enough crying.

651
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:19,300
We're not giving out
crying patches.

652
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:20,895
Come on. Join the group.
Let's go.

653
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:23,526
Today.
Let's go!

654
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,308
This one's trying to get
his fitness patch here.

655
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,286
Yeah. Well, this is
important.

656
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:31,854
Make it quick.

657
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,784
So it turns out that Beth's

658
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:37,994
not the only one
that's going down.

659
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:43,361
- So?
- So my wife's in it too.

660
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:48,041
More the merrier.

661
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,627
You can't give that stuff
to the DA.

662
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:55,066
- Putting me in a tough spot.
- I know.

663
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:56,706
I mean, I'm Team Dean
all the way.

664
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,632
I just need you to drag
your feet a little bit.

665
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,572
Why would I do that?

666
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:04,452
- Come on, man.
- No, it'd be

667
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:07,408
a different story if you were
one of us, but...

668
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:11,408
Dennis, stop whipping Tyler.

669
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:15,269
If I'm gonna have your back

670
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:17,010
I'd want to know
that you'd have mine.

671
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,760
I'll do whatever it takes.

672
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:28,127
Let's talk at
the next meeting.

673
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:31,611
All right. See you there.

674
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:33,057
Yeah you will.

675
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,100
Let's go. Line up.

676
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:48,502
I fixed the lock.

677
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:53,005
What are you doing?

678
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:57,538
- Hungry?
- I mean, yeah, always, but...

679
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:01,591
We're having citrus-braised
lamb shanks.

680
00:38:04,892 --> 00:38:08,291
What...
happened with Angela?

681
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,197
I mean, she's not
really roommate material.

682
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,065
Oh.

683
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:17,475
What is she, like,
a clean freak or something?

684
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:20,924
You ever see that episode
of "Hoarders"

685
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,893
with the woman
who kept dead cats?

686
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:24,440
Of course.

687
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,370
That's Angela?

688
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,112
Yeah, but instead
of dead cats,

689
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:29,986
it was rotisserie chickens.

690
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,729
She would eat off them
for weeks.

691
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:36,065
They were all over the place.

692
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:40,877
You like mint jelly
with lamb?

693
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:44,260
- No.
- Good.

694
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:47,835
So, why did you leave?

695
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:52,713
Isn't that what you wanted?

696
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:59,252
I mean, why else would you
do something this crazy.

697
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,604
Are you mad?

698
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:08,268
I was, at first.

699
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:13,627
But then I thought about it,
and...

700
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:19,268
no one's ever
really needed me before.

701
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,565
No one's ever
needed me either.

702
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:38,470
- Oh. You got any cumin?
- Uhh...

703
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:43,221
Does taco seasoning count?

704
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,879
It's close enough.

705
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:51,498
Also, it's so nice to have
my bucket back.

706
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,373
Thank you.

707
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:57,624
This is older than me.

708
00:39:57,943 --> 00:40:00,496
Well, I figure it's what
fancy politicians drink.

709
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,630
Thank you.

710
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:08,768
So how does it
feel being tax ID#49-3451299?

711
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,507
- Overwhelming.
- Why's that?

712
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:13,600
There's a lot more people
to answer to.

713
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:14,936
Based on the other night,

714
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,998
I think you handled
it pretty well.

715
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:19,009
What was the vote?

716
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:20,685
4-3.

717
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:22,694
Close.

718
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:24,607
There's always
someone to convince.

719
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:28,982
- Not if you had my vote.
- Serious?

720
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:32,185
You think a strip club owner
has a shot?

721
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,530
You're of the people.

722
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:37,271
I'll need lots of advice.

723
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,099
What changed your mind?
