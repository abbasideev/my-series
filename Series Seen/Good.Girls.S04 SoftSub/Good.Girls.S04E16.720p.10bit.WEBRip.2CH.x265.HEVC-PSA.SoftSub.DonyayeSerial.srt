1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,214
‐ Don't y'all know
the drill by now?

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,760
‐ What if we ordered for him?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,345
‐ He'll be here.

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,180
‐ I'm gonna go get that food.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,142
And when I come back,
that seat better be occupied.

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,188
‐ Anything?

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,149
‐ Can't pick up the tab
if he doesn't show.

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,363
‐ You told him here, right?
‐ He's coming.

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,365
‐ Just like
your strip‐club guy

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,033
was moving all that
funny money.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,868
‐ And the stuff
from the councilman's office

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
was all we would need.

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,538
‐ We're trying.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,041
‐ It sounds like you're
trying to go to jail.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,384
‐ Come here.

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,640
Yo.
‐ Yo.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,891
‐ You hungry?

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,893
‐ No, I'm good.

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,811
‐ Watching your figure?

20
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,522
‐ Yeah, it's hard
looking this beautiful.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,402
‐ Or you're meeting
someone more important?

22
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,736
‐

23
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,614
What's up then?
‐ Get in.

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,078
‐ Excuse me.

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,455
Are you Beth Boland?

26
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,124
‐ Yes, I am.

27
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,418
‐ I just voted for you.

28
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,836
Good luck today.

29
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,046
‐ Thank you for your support.

30
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,719
‐

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,930
‐ You guys,
just don't leave yet.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,101
‐ You know...

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,603
I think I finally
figured it out.

34
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,438
‐ What's that?

35
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,940
‐ Why she's got you
by the jewels.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,275
‐ Oh, yeah?

37
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,944
‐ Yeah, it's always
the spicy ones.

38
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,529
‐ My kind of girl.

39
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,449
‐ Yeah, well, makes me nervous.

40
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,325
‐ Don't be.

41
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,453
‐ Well, 'cause when
it all goes south,

42
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,454
I need you to be clearheaded.

43
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,789
‐ No, she's just
some bitch, bro.

44
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,544
‐ Oh, she's more than that.

45
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,296
Hmm?

46
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,465
Come on.
‐

47
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,635
You know me.
‐

48
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,094
Do I?

49
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,143
‐ I'll do what I got to do.

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,561
All right?

51
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,315
‐ Let's see how far
we can take her, yeah?

52
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,983
‐ Drag that bitch
till she drops.

53
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,153
‐ That's right.

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,280
Forget lunch.

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,992
I think you need a boba.

56
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,744
What, you too cool
for boba now?

57
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,162
Put your seat belt on.

58
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,333
‐ Okay, okay, we're going.

59
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,673
‐ Yo, is that him?

60
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,591
‐ Nope, nothing. Oh.

61
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,301
‐ What's it say?

62
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,307
‐ I won.

63
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,311
‐ Oh, boy.

64
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,814
‐ She won.

65
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,651
‐ Seriously?

66
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,196
‐ Whiskey for the councilwoman.

67
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,532
‐ Where were you?
‐ Something came up.

68
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,869
‐ I looked like an idiot.

69
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,454
‐ To getting tough on crime.

70
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,081
‐ How am I supposed to do that

71
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,959
if I've got nothing
to give them?

72
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,128
‐ Change of plans.

73
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,005
‐ Why?

74
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,049
‐ Too much heat.

75
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,510
‐ Yeah, but the heat's
in charge.

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,513
‐ Yeah, that don't mean
we have to do it their way.

77
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
To keep your hands clean.

78
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,896
‐ What is it?

79
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,815
‐ Your acceptance speech.

80
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,611
Break a leg.

81
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,663
‐ Dinner!

82
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,920
Huh?

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,423
We have steak portobello

84
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:20,343
with a five‐cheese
mushroom risotto.

85
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,097
Well...

86
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,600
is there a problem, sir?

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,936
‐ There's ice in the middle.

88
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,440
‐ Oh, I'll just
toss it back on the grill.

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,693
‐ I'm also cool
with just PB on Ritz.

90
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,612
‐ Oh, well...

91
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,574
I just didn't want you
to go into...

92
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,911
food shock, since, you know...

93
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,163
‐ I'll survive.

94
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,832
‐ I don't know‐‐
you guys were just, uh...

95
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,125
pretty close.

96
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,629
‐ We still are.
‐ What do you mean?

97
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,131
‐ He's been helping out
at my practices.

98
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,300
‐ He has?
‐ Yeah, he and my coach

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,136
found out they used to play
against each other in college.

100
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,138
‐ Does he ever...

101
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,390
you know, like just...

102
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,309
ask about me, or is it...

103
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,977
‐ Mom.

104
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,146
‐ Hmm?

105
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,273
‐ You'll survive, too.

106
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
‐

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,620
‐ The mushrooms all exploded.

108
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,419
‐
‐ Congratulations.

109
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,676
They didn't have
any patriotic options.

110
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,470
‐ Tastes the same.
‐ Hmm.

111
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,515
So do you want
to run your speech?

112
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,809
‐ Ah, I'm still working on it.

113
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,519
‐ Well,
if you change your mind,

114
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,355
I will be in...

115
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,774
the garage.

116
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,818
‐ What are you doing
in the garage?

117
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,321
‐ Cleaning up.

118
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,807
‐ Hey, ladies.

119
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,478
We got a family meeting
or lovers' quarrel?

120
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,855
What have we got?

121
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,691
‐ No, man,
we just want to talk.

122
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,901
‐ Shoot.

123
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,695
‐ I need you to leave
my wife out of this.

124
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,240
‐ Why?

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,075
‐ What do you mean why?

126
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,162
‐ Well, isn't she the problem?
‐ Not yours.

127
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,957
‐ Well, she's the reason
that you two are such losers.

128
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,792
‐ No, no, no, no, man,
you're not gonna do that

129
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,669
Harry Potter mind spell on us.

130
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,507
‐ All right, look,
everyone benefits from it.

131
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,009
She's gonna help
grow the company.

132
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,386
‐ Yeah, I don't‐‐I don't
think you're hearing me.

133
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,893
‐ All right.

134
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,272
‐ Leave my wife out of this.

135
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,567
‐ No, I got that part, yeah.
‐ Then don't be stupid.

136
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,737
‐ Or what?

137
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,867
‐ You don't want me
to make you understand.

138
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,079
‐ You think a guy my size
hasn't taken a few punches?

139
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,623
‐ Ain't nobody talking
about punches.

140
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,626
‐ I've been stuffed
into lockers, dumpsters.

141
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,711
At camp, I was lit on fire.

142
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,130
‐ Yeah, you ever seen a dog
rag‐doll a stuffed animal?

143
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,298
You ever seen that?

144
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,467
‐

145
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,260
‐ What, you think that's funny?

146
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,097
‐

147
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,228
There you go.

148
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,980
Take it.
‐ What for?

149
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,149
‐ 'Cause the only way
you're gonna shut me up

150
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,943
is to kill me.

151
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:15,829
♪

152
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,374
‐ I am honored
to have this opportunity.

153
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,167
Uh, thank you
to my husband, Dean,

154
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,836
for his tireless support.

155
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,963
And thank you
to all my supporters

156
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,673
and my volunteers.

157
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,508
I made a promise to this city

158
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
to reduce crime
in our community,

159
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,013
and I do plan to deliver.

160
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,349
But I can't do it alone.

161
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,642
I'm gonna need your help.

162
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,353
We're all gonna
have to do our part.

163
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,021
And together,

164
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,942
we can heal our city
of this disease.

165
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,152
‐ Councilwoman, can you speak

166
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,154
to the corruption
in your own backyard?

167
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,865
‐ Uh, I don't‐‐I'm sorry.

168
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,491
I don't understand
the question.

169
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,160
‐ Can you comment
on the allegations

170
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,703
that Councilman Martín

171
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,414
uses city projects for
kickbacks and money laundering?

172
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,332
‐ I have only known
the councilman

173
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,879
to be honest and loyal
to the people of Ashfield.

174
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,382
But if there is
any impropriety here,

175
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,634
I will exhaust every resource

176
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,970
to maintain
the community's trust.

177
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,724
‐ You can turn it off now.

178
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,731
‐ Yeah.

179
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,692
‐ Got "Detroit News"
on line one.

180
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,235
‐ Tell 'em no comment.

181
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,904
‐ Uh, what about
"Oakland Press," "Freep,"

182
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,240
Action News 7,
WDIV, and FOX 2?

183
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,160
They're all on hold, too.

184
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,828
Hello?

185
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,625
‐ I'll let the councilman
speak for himself.

186
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,796
Thank you.
No more questions.

187
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,219
‐ I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

188
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,933
‐ That's why we're here.

189
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,769
‐ Well, ask away.
I'm an open book.

190
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,772
‐ You sure
you don't want a lawyer?

191
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,398
‐ I've got nothing to hide.

192
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,691
‐ All right.

193
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,778
Explain to us
how we got it all wrong.

194
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,406
‐ Are you guys close
to your families?

195
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,950
‐ Only on holidays.

196
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,410
‐ I talk to my mom twice a day.

197
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,330
‐ Forget you, but you get it.

198
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,166
You grow up with someone,
you got your blinders on.

199
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,710
You want to believe
they can do no wrong.

200
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,797
‐ So this is all on him?

201
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,258
‐ Look, did I know

202
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,468
that he was running
with the wrong crowd? Sure.

203
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,470
Did I know that he was
gonna use my position

204
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,721
to line his pockets?

205
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,808
Absolutely not.

206
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,978
‐ But his name
isn't on any of this.

207
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,771
‐ Hey, you're welcome
to take a look.

208
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,482
‐ We know yours isn't either.

209
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:54,279
‐ Then aren't you sitting in
front of the wrong person?

210
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,407
‐ Okay.

211
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,993
Maybe you can help us, then.

212
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,995
‐ Why is all the money
in question

213
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,455
held up in companies
run by your grandmother?

214
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,918
‐ He, um...

215
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,839
He must have
set it up this way.

216
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,258
‐ Then you should really get
her a lawyer.

217
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,844
‐ 'Cause this is either
on you or Grandma.

218
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,345
‐ Your choice.

219
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,347
‐ Good news is she won't
serve that much time.

220
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,349
‐ Why?
‐ What is she, like, 100?

221
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,186
She'll croak long before
the sentence is done.

222
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,439
‐ Um...

223
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,027
Why can't it be him?

224
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,905
‐ 'Cause he's got something
you don't.

225
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,033
‐ What's that?

226
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,330
‐ Can you talk to my landlord?

227
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,417
‐ About what?
‐ You know, lowering my rent.

228
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,211
‐ What do you think?

229
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,630
‐ What about a disabled
parking permit?

230
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,381
‐ Are you disabled?

231
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,550
‐ She has one.

232
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,052
‐ I was shot.

233
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,012
‐ Being a ding‐dong
doesn't count.

234
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,889
‐ What‐‐what's the point
of all your new power

235
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,557
if we can't get something
out of it?

236
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,893
‐ How about not drawing
any more attention to ourselves

237
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,978
before we get out of here?

238
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,565
‐ Where we at?
‐ Okay.

239
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,401
Now I've lost my place.
‐ Just ballpark it.

240
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,570
‐ Well...

241
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,530
between the club,

242
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,241
the trips to Canada,

243
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,160
and what's left
from the purses...

244
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,538
It looks, um...

245
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,251
Good.

246
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,171
‐ How good?

247
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,300
‐ Good enough.

248
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,266
‐ Fine, who's yours?
‐ Evel Knievel.

249
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,518
‐ No way, dude.
‐ Come on, man, do the math.

250
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,104
‐ Anybody can hurl themselves
over a bunch of cars

251
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,522
and break every bone
in their body.

252
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,857
‐ But they didn't.
‐ 'Cause it wasn't a sport.

253
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,109
‐ Till he invented it.

254
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,861
Anyone can box.
‐

255
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,571
Where is he?

256
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,366
‐ I don't know, but I never
known this guy to be late.

257
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,161
‐ Know where Vance is?

258
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,331
‐ No, man.

259
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,379
‐ Hey, guys!

260
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,133
Sorry about that.

261
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,635
But something big
just rolled in

262
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,637
from corporate.
‐ Sweet.

263
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,098
‐ We are getting in
to haircare.

264
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,599
‐ Yes!
‐ Huh?

265
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,810
Now, we need someone smart
to spearhead this.

266
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,978
‐ I'll do it.

267
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,479
‐ Okay, now, we got
a lot of capital

268
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,648
we got to raise,
but I think the payoff's

269
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,524
gonna be pretty huge.

270
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,651
‐ Okay, dude, we‐‐we can
pool our funds.

271
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,988
‐ Actually, I was thinking
about going to, uh...

272
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,198
Stan and Dean for this one.

273
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,539
You guys up for it?

274
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,041
‐ Why not?

275
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,418
‐ Strong hearts, strong sales.

276
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,922
‐ No.

277
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,344
‐ The rest is in the car.

278
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,972
‐ We already have
a garage full of it.

279

out there.

281
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,103

282
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,232
