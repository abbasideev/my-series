181
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,578
‐ Stan loves Deansie.

182
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,121
‐ Not the problem.

183
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,209
‐ It'll make you guys better.
‐ Or it'll make us worse.

184
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,669
‐ We'll just talk about
their stupid skincare business.

185
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,921
‐ How's that gonna help?

186
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,422
‐ When was the last time
we all got boozed up

187
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,257
and it didn't end
in a hug fest?

188
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,093
‐ When was the last time
we got all boozed up?

189
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,053
‐ Exactly.

190
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,221
‐ Time.

191
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,599
‐ It was faster.

192
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,101
‐ You didn't even time it,
did you?

193
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,104
‐ How are we gonna even
get into the building?

194
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,064
‐ Why don't we just go
during the day?

195
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,609
‐ Because he'll be there.

196
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,861
‐ So distract him.
‐ How?

197
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,531
‐ You know how.
‐ No, I don't.

198
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,203
‐ Why did Watergate fail?

199
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,330
‐ 'Cause they got caught.

200
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,915
‐ 'Cause they were men.

201
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,793
‐ She means use your hoo‐ha.
‐ Just stop.

202
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,086
‐ Worked with the wire.

203
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,631
‐ You use your hoo‐ha.

204
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,799
‐ I'm just saying,

205
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,467
take the Brousin
to lunch or something.

206
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,427
‐ I thought we agreed
on "Gang‐Fairy Godfather."

207
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,971
‐ "Brousin" makes more sense.

208
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,140
‐ I'm not doing anything
with the Brousin.

209
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,808
‐ Why not?

210
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,726
‐ Because then
he'll know it's me.

211
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,646
‐ Okay, you guys,
we obviously go at night.

212
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,732
‐ What about the
security guard?

213
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,612
‐ We'll use my hoo‐ha.

214
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,785
‐ Can I help you?

215
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,122
‐ May I use your bathroom?

216
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,227
‐ Okay, so...

217
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,773
‐ What took you so long?
‐ I actually had to pee.

218
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,359
‐ I'm, like, covered in thorns.
‐ Okay, here we go.

219
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:44,329
‐ The penguin is in the igloo.
‐ Huh?

220
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,080
‐ The horse is in the barn.

221
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,249
‐ Then where's
the security guard?

222
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,918
‐ He's still at his desk.

223
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,461
‐ Can you just say that
from now on?

224
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,545
‐ 10‐4.

225
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,464
‐ Bye.
‐ Over and out.

226
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,716
‐ Ugh.

227
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
‐ Just trying to make it fun.

228
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,141
‐ Give me the L15.
Wait, the L16.

229
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,392
‐ They don't have names
on them.

230
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,727
‐ The crocodile teeth ones.

231
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,231
‐ They all have teeth.
‐ Oh, my God.

232
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,815
Crocodile, you amateur.

233
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,076
‐ Where is he?
‐  What's his 20?

234
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,245
‐ Huh?
‐ Where is he?

235
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,122
‐ Uh, he's eating a Kit Kat.
‐ But we heard a door.

236
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,124
‐ Yeah, he's got a whole stash
in the closet.

237
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,043
‐ He was just getting a snack.

238
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,421
‐ Okay, well, hurry up.
‐ Come on, come on.

239
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,757
Bada bing!

240
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,008
Bada boom!
‐ Okay.

241
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,346
What's going on?
‐ It won't open.

242
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,390
Look, it's unlocked.

243
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,768
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What?

244
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,895
‐ Do you have a tool
for one of those?

245
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,232
‐ Oh.

246
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,609
That is a whole different set
of YouTube videos.

247
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,278
‐ Okay.

248
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,946
Maybe his assistant has,
like, a spare or something.

249
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,115
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,077
Oh, he's kind of cute.

251
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,414
‐ Got it.
‐ Sick.

252
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,835
‐ He has a card for everything.

253
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,170
‐ Talk to me, baby.

254
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,965
‐ We okay?

255
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,260
‐ He's on the move.
You got this.

256
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,766
‐ Come on, ladies,
give me a sign.

257
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,038
Well?

258
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,040
‐ I tore my jeans on the way
back out the window.

259
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,125
‐ No.
‐ Yeah, my favorite pair.

260
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,252
‐ Where we at?

261
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,010
You guys want in on this?

262
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,136
‐ What are we gonna do?

263
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,892
‐ 10% off at Chili's.

264
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,394
‐ I could do a marg.

265
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,404
‐ Hill, you up?

266
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,908
‐ Nope.

267
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,035
‐ Guess where I went.

268
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,580
‐ You smell like a cantina.
‐ I only had one.

269
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,249
‐ I didn't ask how many.
‐ Fine. Three.

270
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,504
‐ All right, where did you go?

271
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,381
‐ When's the last time
you had Southwestern egg rolls?

272
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,719
‐ I bought some
from Kroger's last week.

273
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,888
‐ No, at Chili's.

274
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,433
‐ I don't know, Ruby.

275
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,562
‐ Remember that time someone
pulled the fire alarm

276
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,730
and we all had to go outside?

277
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,566
‐ And we sat at the wrong booth
when they let us back in.

278
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,860
‐ You got halfway through
that guy's black bean burger

279
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,737
before you even realized.

280
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,364
‐ Yeah, we were pretty bombed.

281
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,574
‐ We haven't had fun
like that in forever.

282
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,243
‐ We need more like it.

283
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,789
‐ How about Thursday?

284
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,958
‐ They still got
that Texas lemonade?

285
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,127
‐ They do.
‐ In.

286
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,297
‐ So are the Bolands.

287
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,886
‐ What do you mean?

288
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,014
‐ We all used to
have fun together.

289
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,517
‐ Babe, I'm not going
to Chili's

290
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,810
with no damn Bolands.

291
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,896
‐ Fine.

292
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,023
‐ Good.

293
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,441
‐ They can come here.

294
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,697
‐ What is wrong with you?

295
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,575
‐ What is wrong with you?
‐ I don't want a situation.

296
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,494
‐ It's just dinner.
‐ It's gonna be weird.

297
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,913
‐ Don't worry.
I got you covered.

298
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,040
‐ How?
‐ Dean will be there.

299
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,336
‐

300
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,631
‐

301
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,635
Mmm, something smells good.
What you working on over there?

302
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,637
‐ Spanish omelet.
‐ Mmm!

303
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,306
‐ Little chorizo.
‐ Mmm!

304
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,643
‐ Red peppers, fried potatoes,
and a pinch of salt.

305
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,978
‐ Mmm!

306
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,272
Just like we are
in Barcelona.

307
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,315
‐ Mm‐hmm.

308
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,819
‐ Mmm.
Oh, whoa, whoa, sir.

309
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,945
‐ What?

310
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,449
‐ Well, where's mine?

311
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,910
‐ Everything you need
is on the counter.

312
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,874
‐ Well, it's just that,

313
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,084
you know,
you usually make me one.

314
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,504
‐ Well that's when
we were roomies.

315
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,964
‐ Well, what are we now?

316
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,884
‐ You tell me.

317
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,428
‐ Oh, come on.

318
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,223
‐ I mean, we're definitely
not dating, right?

319
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,685
‐ We really can't
just move past this?

320
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,978
‐ Oh, I have.

321
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,025
‐ What is that?
‐ Hinge.

322
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,986
Wait, no, this is Tinder.

323
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,614
‐ You're back on the apps?

324
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,492
‐ I mean, how else
am I supposed

325
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,409
to put myself out there?

326
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,286
‐ Why do you need
to put yourself anywhere?

327
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,162
‐

328
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,665
'Cause you don't
wanna do this, right?

329
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,250
‐ I don't...

330
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,839
I don't wanna
not do this, okay?

331
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,053
And I definitely don't want you
doing this with anyone else.

332
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,891
‐ So you don't wanna date?

333
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,142
‐ Right.

334
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,147
‐ But you don't wanna not date?
‐ Right.

335
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:51,195
‐ Essentially,
you wanna not not date?

336
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,532
‐ I think so.

337
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:59,495
‐ But do you wanna
not not date anyone else?

338
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,664
‐ No.

339
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,253
‐ I mean...

340
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,508
I'm down with that.

341
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,343
‐ Cool.

342
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,764
‐ You want cheese in yours?
‐ Duh.

343
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,769
‐ You can just turn that off.
‐ Yeah, I think I will.

344
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,859
Jesus, how did you get
so many matches on this?

345
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,446
‐ I'm a catch.
‐ Obviously.

346
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,616
‐ No, you wanna know my secret?
‐ Yes, please.

347
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,786
‐ I just...I think
about the kind of tail

348
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,830
I wanna land, right?

349
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,960
And then I just sort of cater
my profile to the customer.

350
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,379
‐ Sorry,
like, you make stuff up or?

351
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,468
‐ I mean, it's more like
I just sort of tell them

352
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,511
what they wanna hear,
and then they come to you.

353
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,140
Have I ever volunteered
at an animal shelter?

354
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,977
I mean, no, but I don't
want 'em gassed either.

355
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,479
Yeah,
once you figure it out,

356
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,898
it's like shooting fish
in a barrel.

357
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,150
And I'm no, like, coder,

358
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,818
but I'm don't want
some algorithm

359
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,695
telling me
who I should be with.

360
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,159
‐ Ooh, Oaxacan street corn.
‐ Dad hates that cheese.

361
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,663
‐ She is not wrong.
‐ I'll make coleslaw.

362
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,373
‐ Then after dinner,
you and Stan

363
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,499
can be on the same team.

364
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,586
‐ For what?
‐ Scattergories.

365
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,173
‐ Wait, now we're doing
a game night?

366
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,925
‐ We just need to be normal
around each other.

367
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,927
‐ We've never played
Scattergories.

368
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,720
‐ Twister?

369
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,184
‐ You guys,
I can get us into that office.

370
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,645
We've been using
my hoo‐ha all wrong.

371
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,277
Hey, Sara, how are you?

372
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,863
It's a little late
for you to be up, isn't it?

373
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,324
‐ My bedtime's
not for another two hours.

374
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,244
‐ Go to your room.

375
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,128
‐ What?

376
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,384
‐ I can't believe I finally
met a girl who butt chugs.

377
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,345
‐ Well, how else are you
gonna pound a White Claw?

378
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:23,973
‐ Cheers.
‐

379
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,019
So what did you
major in at Michigan?

380
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,814
‐ Oh, science.

381
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,566
‐ How did you get
through organic chem?

382
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,903
‐ I just really love
organic stuff.

383
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,488
It's actually pretty easy
at Whole Foods.

384
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,912
‐ Well, uh...
‐

385
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,416
‐ You know, most girls
are turned off by my profile.

386
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,043
‐ You're kidding me.
Why?

387
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,421
‐ They get all uptight
about the hating kids stuff.

388
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,257
‐ Ugh, I mean, kids suck.
‐ Right?

389
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,593
‐ Yeah.
‐ Oh, hell yeah.

390
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,263
Jell‐O shots.
‐ Our fave.

391
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,098
‐ To not remembering
anything tomorrow morning.

392
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,185
‐ I will drink to that.

393
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,607

394
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,945
‐ Whew.

395
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,281
‐ They go down easier
the more you do 'em.

396
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,454
‐ Oh, no, I'm just‐‐I'm cold.

397
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,332
‐ You should've
brought a jacket.

398
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,543
‐ I need you
to have the full picture.

399
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,129
‐ Appreciate it.

400
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,882
‐ Now that you had a preview...

401
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
Can I borrow yours?

402
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,388
‐ Seriously?
‐ The next round will be on me.

403
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,226

She's right.

Mmm.

Okay.

We don't have any money.

Roommate.

‐ He's just a‐‐he's a coworker.

465
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,792
‐ You work at a mini‐mart.

466
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,129
‐ Yeah, he's the boss.

467
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,339
‐ So now you wear
your boss's jacket?

468
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:57,014
‐ No, he was thinking about
adding a jacket to the uniform,

469
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,557
and he wanted feedback,

470
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:03,228
so obviously I'm gonna
tell him smaller sizes.

471
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,231
‐ Hey, you know what?
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,900
‐ Kevin, please.
‐ This is my fault.

473
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,902
‐ Can we please just talk about
this later when we get home?

474
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,820
‐ See, I really thought things
would be different now.

475
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,655
‐ I promise you.
It's not what it looks like.

476
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,908
Okay, but I can't talk
about it here, so please‐‐

478
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,829
‐ Yeah, it's fine.

479
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,248
‐ Listen, I don't wanna get
in the way of anything here.

480
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,792
‐ No, it's fine,
I was just leaving.

481
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,877
‐ No.
‐ No, I feel like I should go.

482
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,378
‐ No.

483
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,591
‐ No to me or no to him?
‐ We literally just met, so...

484
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,386
‐ How'd you meet?

485
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,349
‐ Bumble, Hinge,
I don't even remember.

486
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,731
‐ All right,
she's all yours man.

487
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,700
‐ You wanna go do another shot?

488
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,288
‐ Yes.

489
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,384
‐ I got phone records,
bank accounts, names, numbers‐‐

490
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,927
‐ Quite a haul.

491
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,437
‐ He knows everything.

492
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,607
‐ Gotta say,

493
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,236
none of this looks good for
a lady who's tough on crime.

494
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,409
‐ What do you want?
‐ Let me buy you guys a drink.

495
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,828
‐ Why?

496
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,455
‐ Talk strategy.
What's good around here?

497
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,252
‐ There's a Chili's.
‐ Perfect.

498
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,296
Can I throw my bike
in the back?

499
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,601
Could you take
the child lock off?

500
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,190
‐ That doctor dude sounds
way more messed up than you.

501
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,486
‐ Therapist.
‐ Textbook.

502
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:20,657
‐ Mm, textbook what?
‐ Gay.

503
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,202
‐ He's just British.
‐ Your ex‐husband, super gay.

504
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,371
‐ Don't tell me‐‐Noah?

505
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,415
‐ Everyone
in law enforcement's gay.

506
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,709
‐ And why is it
that I'm listening to you

507
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,045
about any of this again?

508
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,006
‐ 'Cause I'm the only one
who calls it like it is.

509
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,842
‐ But you just have
the one call?

510
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,220
‐ Okay, you know
who couldn't be

511
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,347
more straight and into you?

512
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,890
‐ Let me guess.

513
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,644
‐ Your hobo friend.

514
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:53,315
‐ He's
experiencing homelessness.

515
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,359
‐ Whatever.
That dude's all sac.

516
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,031
‐ I just don't think I should
be with anybody right now.

517
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,366
‐ Why is that?

518
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,995
‐ Because I have issues.

519
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,124
‐ Everyone does.
‐ Well, mine could be studied.

520
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,088
‐ Well, at least
you're not in denial.

521
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,881
‐ Thanks.

522
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,424
‐ I'm serious.

523
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,592
Being aware of it

524
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,677
means you can't
be that messed up.

525
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,849
‐ How can a bro like you
be such a good listener?

526
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,894
‐ I'm not really a bro.

527
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,063
‐ Sorry, bruh.

528
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,610
‐ I'm gay.
‐ Funny.

529
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,737
‐ Everything on my profile
is made up.

530
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,452
‐ But what about
the picture of you

531
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,121
in Jamaica with the cheetah?

532
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,455
‐ Photoshop.

533
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,666
‐ But you had on
a backwards hat?

534
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,167
‐ To convince my dad.

535
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,965
‐ Well, okay then.

536
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,137
‐ Mm.
‐ Mm.

537
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,723
‐ Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

538
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,308
‐ You know, this is actually
one of the best dates

539
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,435
I've ever had with a girl.

540
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,103
‐ And you, my friend,

541
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,064
make very convincing
human garbage.

542
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,277
‐ Could I get a selfie
for my dad?

543
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,194
‐ Why not?

544
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,120
‐ I'm sorry.

545
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,497
‐ Why?

546
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,082
‐ For what I'm about to do.

547
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,474
‐
Hey.

548
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,312
Have you seen this bit
where the guy,

549
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,357
that dude from "SNL,"
he recaps TV shows?

550
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,652
‐ Nope.
‐ It's genius.

551
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,029
He does this thing
where he tries to guess

552
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,822
what the show is
based on the title,

553
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,741
but he has no idea.

554
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,286
‐ How could you?

555
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,550
‐ How are those housewives
in the ATL?

556
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,388
‐ Didn't watch.

557
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,681
‐ Uh‐huh, what'd you guys do?

558
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,643
‐ We went out for drinks.

559
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,145
‐ Twice in one week?

560
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,066
‐ We ran into
a friend of yours.

561
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,109
‐ Yeah?

562
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,990
‐ What, were you trying
to show off

563
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,200
in front of your bike dads?
‐ No.

564
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,077
‐ You must've felt
like a real big shot.

565
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,870
‐ It's not like that.
‐ What's it like then?

566
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,082
‐ You put me in jail.
‐ Not on purpose.

567
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,251
‐ What's the difference?
‐ You would still be in there.

568
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,253
‐ Well, this guy is trying
to make sure I don't go back.

569
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,589
‐ Oh, the grown man in tights.
‐ He's got my back, okay?

570
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,592
‐ You are such an idiot.
‐ Yeah, for trusting you.

571
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,927
‐ He's not your friend.

572
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,887
‐ At least he's trying to help.
‐ To get to me.

573
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,181
‐ What are you talking about?

574
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,269
‐ I have to get the city
to plug his stupid face creams

575
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,105
for, like, conventions
or hotels or whatever.

576
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,819
‐ Wait, he said that?

577
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,614
‐ He was never in it for you.

578
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,744
I really did want Nevada.

579
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,459
‐ She could lose everything.
‐ So could we.

580
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,587
‐ She has kids, Stanley.

581
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,923
‐ Who's sleeping down
that hall?

582
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,887
‐ Since when do you get
to decide to put a woman away?

583
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,305
‐ It's not just about her.

584
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,265
‐ 'Cause I don't remember
marrying a judge.

585
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,601
‐ You can't even
see it anymore.

586
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,019
‐ I can see
we're not in a courtroom.

587
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,189
‐ You could dress it up,
talk around it.

588
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,651
‐ At least in court,
you get a jury.

589
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,236
‐ But we're just criminals now.

590
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,078
You remember our old Nissan?

591
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,958
‐ Rust bucket?
‐ Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

592
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,253
It started out with
a little patch on the door...

593
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,297
but, eventually,
I took over the whole car.

594
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,298
‐ Come on.

595
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,175
‐ When's the last time
we've been to church?

596
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,803
‐ It bought our daughter
a kidney.

597
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,347
‐ Or volunteered
at the food bank?

598
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,973
‐ It pays for Harry's school.

599
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,142
‐ And the crazy thing

600
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,353
is that I don't
even feel guilty anymore.

601
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,896
‐ 'Cause we deserve it.

602
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,783
‐ Justify it all you want...

603
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,827
but, eventually,
it rots out the floorboards.

604
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,343
‐ I guess we should
cancel dinner with the Bolands.

605
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,179
‐ Yeah, probably.

606
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,728
‐ No, dude, dude,
she practically broke my jock.

607
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,855
‐ Sounds like
a wild night, buddy.

608
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,399
‐ I was like‐‐
I was like, "Chill.

609
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,985
I know you can't get enough,
but Papa has got to sleep."

610
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,029
‐

611
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,992
Hey, where's the file key?
‐ Top right.

612
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,868
‐ Yeah, that's where I left it.

613
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,374
Are you gonna see her again?
‐ Hell, no.

614
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,751
‐ I cannot keep up
with your women.

615
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,755
‐ Oh, here.

616
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,010
‐ That's weird.

617
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,678
‐ You must have moved it.

618
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,223
‐ I didn't.
‐ It wasn't me.

619
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,896
‐ Can you grab
the night logins from security?

620
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,939
‐ Yeah.

621
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,446
‐

622
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,199
‐ Who is she?
‐ That's your boy's girl.

623
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,453
‐ You think this is funny?
‐

624
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,663
What'd she get?
‐ What do you think?

625
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,665
‐ I think
you got played, brother.

626
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,140
‐ Yes, suck it!

627
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,142
‐ All right, chief,
time for homework.

628
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,977
‐ One more level.

629
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,146
‐ You got a book report, buddy.
‐ I'll do it later.

630
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,606
‐ It's late.

631
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,232
‐ Mom said I could stay up.

632
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,237
‐ Did you get almond milk?

633
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,782
‐ I got oat milk.
It's better for you.

634
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,705
‐ Where'd you get this?

635
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,207
‐ It was on my car
in the parking lot.

636
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,835
She's your buddy's wife, right?
I like her.

637
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,171
‐ Why?
‐ I don't know.

638
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,841
She seems like a leader.
I hope she wins.

639
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,265
‐ You know what?
Me too.

640
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,309
‐ Die!

641
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,196
Hey.
‐ Turn it off.

642
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,739
‐ I can't see.

643
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,034
‐ Turn it off.

644
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,036
‐ Mom,
tell your husband to move.

645
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,163
‐ Just let him finish, honey.

646
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,883
‐ Mom!
‐ Vance!

647
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,010
What the hell are you doing?

648
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,027
‐ Book report, now!

649
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,590
‐ Hey, you're here.

650
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,758
I know you're not allowed

651
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,884
to endorse one way
or the other,

652
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,844
but I thought you could
wear one while you work out.

653
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,304
‐ Just take a seat.

654
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,268
‐ Uh‐oh, am I falling behind
with working women

655
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,021
ages 18 to 34
who like to eat food?

656
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,274
‐ No, I have something
that's gonna help you.

657
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,109
‐ I thought you weren't
allowed to do that?

658
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,904
‐ Well,
I don't mean the election.

659
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,365
‐ What's this?

660
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,076
‐ Everything you
were looking for last night.

661
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,995
‐ I don't know what
you're talking about.

662
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:14,250
‐ Well, you or your sister
or someone else

663
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,086
that you're working for
swiped in at 9:38

664
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,965
with my assistant's ID,
so when you're done,

665
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,092
I am gonna need 'em back.

666
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,769
‐ What happens now?

667
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,979
‐ I don't understand.

668
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,815
‐ I wake up
with a gun to my face

669
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,274
in the middle of the night?

670
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,943
‐ You have a campaign to win.

671
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,236
‐ And then when we're done,

672
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,821
you roll me up
in a carpet for trash day?

673
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:48,326
‐ Relax, jeez.
No, that's not my style.

674
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:52,413
I'm more the guy
that makes things difficult.

675
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,959
I know people, right?

676
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,503
You got a husband
that's facing a long stretch.

677
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,255
Sister's got a record.

678
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,923
I mean, those two are
low‐hanging fruit,

679
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,259
and there's no way that
that friend of yours

680
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,927
can pay
for her son's private school.

681
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,178
That's just
a quick call to state,

682
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,265
get her tax returns,
you know how that goes.

683
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,768
Yeah, can't let you off
that easy, Beth.

684
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,270
You have a lot of work to do.

685
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,862
‐ Oh, wait, wait, wait, stop.

686
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,364
