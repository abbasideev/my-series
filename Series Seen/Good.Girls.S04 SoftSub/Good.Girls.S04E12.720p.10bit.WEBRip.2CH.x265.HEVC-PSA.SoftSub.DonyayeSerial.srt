1
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:04,036
.

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,466
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,764
- All you have to do

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,502
is print and drop.

5
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,767
Your husband's here.

6
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:13,210
- My wife was laundering
a gang's money

7
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:14,508
through my business.

8
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:16,741
Danny's in the hospital.
Can you go be with him?

9
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,051
- Sort of out of the country.

10
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,382
- I just woke up.

11
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:21,680
- About time.

12
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:22,881
- I want you out of her life.

13
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,156
- You get us in that club,
and she'll never see me again.

14
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,422
- What'd you say to her,
Stanley?

15
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:28,687
- We made a deal.

16
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,228
- I'm a building inspector
with Wayne County.

17
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:33,527
You folks got yourself
a load of violations.

18
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:36,299
- We came up
with some creative solutions.

19
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,136
What do you think?
-

20
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,467
- You said all we had to do
was print it.

21
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:40,435
- And then drop it.

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,768
- I assumed that you meant
in our country.

23
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:45,176
- I don't like this SUV.

24
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,375
- Every time we make a move,
he does too.

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,443
- Turn, turn!
- Annie!

26
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:49,377
- Grab the money.

27
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,116
- What are we doing?
- Getting rid of it.

28
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,480
- Put it all on two.

29
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,252
- Oh, thank God.

30
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,320
- Lady Luck ain't on your side
tonight, huh?

31
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:59,652
You got a guardian angel
I don't know about?

32
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,686
- Maybe.

33
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,529
- At the Women in IT Awards
in 2017,

34
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:10,762
which fictional character
did the head of MI-6

35
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:12,665
reveal is actually female?

36
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,205
- Mm, Q.

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,833
- Mark from Ohio,
let's see what you said.

38
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,769
- Come on.
- M.

39
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,408
- Oi, you idiot.

40
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:20,442
It's Q.

41
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,808
- Austin in consumer
marketing, you said Q.

42
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:25,843
- Yes.
You're the man, Austin.

43
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,585
- Okay, here comes
another question.

44
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,323
- Hey.

45
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:34,654
- Do you still have
my mini blender?

46
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,722
- What mini blender?

47
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:37,855
- The one that you borrowed
to make piña coladas

48
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,726
with your Wi-Fi neighbor.
- No, I gave that back to you.

49
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,299
- Well, I can't find it.

50
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,367
- Maybe you loaned it
to someone else.

51
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:46,303
- No one else
borrows a blender.

52
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,799
- So maybe you lost it.

53
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,901
- Where would I lose it, Annie?
- I guess if you knew that,

54
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,309
it wouldn't be lost,
would it, Beth?

55
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,212
- Can you please just look?

56
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,478
- Chillax, I'm looking.
I'm looking.

57
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,317
Okay, let's see.

58
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,616
Looking and I'm looking.

59
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,815
Nope, don't see it.

60
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,521
- It's red with a black lid.

61
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,886
- Silver button?
- Yep.

62
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,361
- White cord?
- Yeah, I think so.

63
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,792
- Dishwasher-safe?
- Do you have it?

64
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:15,662
- I'll keep looking.

65
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:17,532
- All right, well,
if you find it,

66
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:18,896
can you bring it
by here tomorrow?

67
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,799
- What time?
- Early.

68
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,900
- I have work.
- Before that.

69
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,275
- Why do you need it?

70
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,277
- It doesn't matter.
It's mine!

71
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:29,808
- Yeah, except that when I
borrow something from you,

72
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:30,941
I have to bring it back,

73
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,514
but when you borrow something
from me,

74
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:33,746
I still have to bring it back.

75
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,880
- I just have a lot going on
tomorrow, okay?

76
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,519
- I have a job.

77
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:38,718
- So do I.

78
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:40,225
- Since when?

79
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,458
- It's called
raising four children.

80
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,197
Okay.

81
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,264
You know what?
That's fine.

82
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,431
I just won't take Ben to school

83
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,235
or have money
to give him for lunch,

84
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,533
because I'll have to skip work

85
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:53,271
so your husband
who is on house arrest

86
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,339
can have his nutritious
morning smoothie.

87
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:58,309
- I thought you didn't have it.

88
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:02,346
- That's if I have it.

89
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,680
Jesus.

90
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:16,954
I thought it was trash day.

91
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:22,828
Excuse me,
I mean date night with Angela.

92
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,533
- Who's Angela?

93
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,616
Get your coat.

94
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,849
- Why?

95
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:45,851
- 'Cause you'll be cold.

96
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:48,755
- Cold 'cause I'm dead?

97
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,464
- Your shoes too.

98
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,268
- My son's gonna be home
any minute.

99
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,468
- Mm-hmm.

100
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:03,440
We should probably hustle then,
huh?

101
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,873
- Gonna wonder where I am.

102
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,710
- Yeah, that's kinda the point.

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,783
No.

104
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,325
Don't do that.

105
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:26,562
- And time
for another question.

106
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:28,399
For Canada's centennial,

107
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,928
what gift did Elizabeth II

108
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:35,637
give Ottawa six pairs of
from the Rideau river?

109
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:39,344
- Swans.

110
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,611
After you.

111
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,787
- Tom from Boise.

112
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:54,986
- Swans?

113
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,829
- Tell me when.

114
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,097
It's gonna be all chocolate.

115
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,538
- Okay, when, when.

116
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,936
How about some OJ?

117
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,839
- How about a Coke?

118
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,350
- Okay, one Coke.

119
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,714
- Can I have one?

120
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:21,848
- Not for breakfast, honey.

121
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:22,882
- That's not fair.

122
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,917
- Just be grateful
you have two working wrists.

123
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,821
- Okay.

124
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,430
- Yes!

125
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,893
- Don't break anything.

126
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,095
- Dad, look what I got.

127
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,371
- Nice.

128
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,603
- Hey, have you seen my phone?

129
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:43,738
- Yeah, you left it
in the bathroom.

130
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,476
- Oh.

131
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,577
- Hey, where is
the mini blender?

132
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,678
- Annie has it, which is why
she won't text me back.

133
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:50,943
- Oh, great.

134
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:53,847
What's on tap for you today?

135
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:55,585
- Carpool.

136
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,455
- Is that what
they're calling it now?

137
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,085
- What's that mean?
- Hmm.

138
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,528
You gonna drop off kids
or cash?

139
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:12,437
- Kids.

140
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,406
- Hmm, then what?

141
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,510
- Some laundry.

142
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,776
- Hmm, are you gonna
wash clothes or cash?

143
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,880
- Clothes.

144
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:29,487
- Hmm, just wondering
what to expect today.

145
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,785
- Just some errands.

146
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,589
- In what country?

147
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,921
- What are you doing?

148
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,962
Daddy's just kidding.

149
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,901
Okay, you guys.
Go brush your teeth.

150
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,034
- But I'm not done.

151
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,574
- You can take it with you.

152
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,742
- Let's go.
Vámonos.

153
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:55,876
- Nothing's going on right now,
okay?

154
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:00,650
- That's what you said
when you were overseas.

155
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:02,014
- It was just Canada.

156
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,918
- While our son
was in the E.R. alone.

157
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,494
- That won't happen again.
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,163
- Hey.

159
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,473
I got nothing.

160
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,805
- Did you go through her phone?
- Yeah, she deletes them all.

161
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,906
- Well, that's not gonna help.
- Well, what about the fact

162
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,875
that she ran a crime ring
through my hot tub store?

163
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,580
- That's the problem.
It was yours.

164
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,648
- Yeah, you need something
that's hers.

165
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,584
- What about the fake
Canadian money she's printing?

166
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,949
- On the press that you built.

167
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,721
- Look, I read her emails.
I tore through her car.

168
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:40,492
I even dug around
in her underwear drawer.

169
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,560
There's nothing.
- Does she keep a journal?

170
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,221
- Can't you find some kind
of legal loophole?

171
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,927
- Not with a case like yours.
- I thought you were the best.

172
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:47,995
- He'll keep you out of prison.
- Great.

173
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,535
- But the day they cut
that thing off your ankle,

174
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,064
who's gonna be celebrating?
- Me.

175
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,263
- Her.

176
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,231
- 'Cause she got away
with using you

177
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,266
like one of those period cups.
- Oh, Jesus.

178
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,839
- Don't put a stop to it now.

179
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:01,513
She's gonna be using you
again and again and again.

180
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,515
- This isn't about your case,
man.

181
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,748
- Then what's it about?

182
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:10,280
- It's about sewing
your sack back on.

183
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,283
- Right now, you don't even
need that seat on your bike.

184
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,823
- He's right.
Here.

185
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,022
Just sit on the post.
- Guys.

186
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,760
- There you go.
- Yeah, sit on the post.

187
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,223
- Give me my bike seat.
- Nah, you don't need it, Dean.

188
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,598
- I hear you, okay?

189
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,831
- Then give us something
we can use.

190
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:29,002
- Come on, Dean.

191
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:43,280
Mmm.

192
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,991
Hey, bud.
- Have you seen my mom?

193
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,093
- Did you try homeless guy?

194
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:56,601
- He's at his girlfriend's
all the time.

195
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,999
- What about the therapist?

196
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,066
- She's over him.

197
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,573
- I'm gonna call your dad.

198
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,574
- He wouldn't know.

199
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,939
They're in Minnesota
visiting Nancy's parents.

200
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,176
- I'm sure she's fine.

201
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:15,818
- Hey, Aunt Beth.

202
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,859
- She left her phone?
- It was just in the kitchen.

203
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:26,763
- Was there anything missing?
- There's nothing to take.

204
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,836
Maybe you should call
the police.

205
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:41,140
- You know...

206
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,977
I think I might know
who she's with.

207
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,686
- Don't forget to subtract
the cost of goods.

208
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,721
- And what's that?

209
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,052
- It's the cost of everything

210
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,724
that goes into
selling the bags.

211
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,628
- Okay.

212
00:09:58,126 --> 00:09:59,323
- Hey.

213
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:01,996
- Hey.
What are y'all doing?

214
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,393
- Business.

215
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,703
- Teaching baby girl
accounting.

216
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,397
- Um, so this is
Aunt Beth's pile,

217
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,366
this Annie's, and this is ours.

218
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,170
- Mm-hmm.
Had a good week.

219
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,908
You wanna do the deliveries?

220
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,745
- I'm gonna need all of it.

221
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,946
- That an expense or a loan?

222
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,146
- Just straight-up theft, baby.

223
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,250
- What's this?

224
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:27,186
- First installment.

225
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:29,122
- We'll get the rest.

226
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:32,059
- Oh, I know you will.
- Give her back.

227
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,632
- Okay.

228
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,063
- Okay.

229
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:39,396
- Where should I send
the first installment?

230
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,003
- What do you want?

231
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:46,172
- You know how much of my money
you left in that casino?

232
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:47,404
All of it.

233
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,977
- All of it.

234
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,341
I guess we'll call it even.

235
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:51,749
- I don't want to be even.

236
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,146
- She ain't worth much more
than that.

237
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,985
Not sure how we'll use her.

238
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,690
We'll think of something.

239
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,417
- Oh, Jesus.

240
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,859
- I want my sister back!

241
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,192
- Do you?

242
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:12,968
Finish the job then.

243
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:40,732
.

244
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,064
Don't forget me
when I'm gone

245
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,066
- Regular or double stuff?

246
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:46,870
- What?

247
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,070
- Which one?

248
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,368
- I don't know.

249
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:55,043
I have loved you
for so long

250
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:57,177
- You can try.

251
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:58,816
Everyone tries.

252
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,755
- Double stuff.

253
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:11,125
- You want Chex Mix or Cheetos?

254
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,896
- Chex Mix.

255
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:18,000
- Uh, grab some Skittles,
would you?

256
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,166
- I don't like Skittles.

257
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,807
- They're not for you.

258
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,042
There's so much
for me to do

259
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,275
- I'll go grab water.

260
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,541
Sparkling or regular?

261
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,378
- Sparkling.

262
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:42,926
when I'm gone

263
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,126
Hey.

264
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,998
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

265
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,197
See that guy I'm with?

266
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:53,970
Don't look.

267
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:57,402
He's kidnapping me.

268
00:12:57,437 --> 00:13:00,009
- These are two for one.

269
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,406
- I'm good.

270
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:04,343
Except for the fact that
I'm being kidnapped by him.

271
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,312
So make an excuse;
go call the cops, please.

272
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:08,083
Run.
Quick.

273
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:09,150
- Hey, bro.

274
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:10,954
- What's up?
How's your Moms?

275
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,055
- You always worry.
You should stop by.

276
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,551
- Yeah, I definitely will.

277
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,092
Um, let me get a couple
of those Slurpee cups.

278
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,590
- I don't want a Slurpee.

279
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,461
- It's not for that.
- Huh?

280
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:28,037
- Yeah, we got a long ride
ahead of us.

281
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:37,277
- Ma'am.
Ma'am, he's not available.

282
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:39,543
- I want you to look into...

283
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:41,578
- This is how you serve
your community?

284
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,020
- I'm in a meeting here.
- By looking the other way?

285
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,188
- I didn't think
it was something

286
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:48,321
we could discuss over texts--
- "Of the people" my ass.

287
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,290
Okay.

288
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,160
Can we have the room, please?

289
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:55,295
Thank you.

290
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,402
What do you want me to do?

291
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,140
- I want you to help me
get her back!

292
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,274
- Not so easy.
- Why not?

293
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:08,308
- I can't be anywhere
near that.

294
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,607
- Oh, so now he's not
your brother or whatever?

295
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,543
- It's political suicide, Beth.

296
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:15,887
- What he will do to my sister
is far worse, trust me.

297
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,505
- Detroit Police.

298
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,913
- Councilman Martín
for the Chief.

299
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,212
- One moment.

300
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,248
- I can't.

301
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,320
- Why not?
- You know why.

302
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:54,519
- Not so easy, is it?

303
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:57,423
- It's not my job;
that's the problem.

304
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,425
- Tell that to your sister.
- It's him.

305
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:11,536
- I--I got Chief Gorski
on line one.

306
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:16,475
- Tell him "false alarm."

307
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,510
- See, it's not only
for your face.

308
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:22,415
It's also a whole-body oil.

309
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,319
- What's this have to do
with fantasy football?

310
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:26,650
- Well, yeah,
but first things first.

311
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:27,717
Look.

312
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,423
- Can we just talk
about our picks?

313
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,228
- Yeah, as soon as we talk
about your dermis.

314
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,295
- Listen, I got my own system.

315
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,033
- But you're using
Brawn and Beauty?

316
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,595
- Brother,
this is soap and water.

317
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,036
- Oof.

318
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,203
That is a dangerous road,
my friend.

319
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,403
- Yeah, so are these dudes
that you're in with.

320
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,373
- Nah, it's not like that.

321
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,947
- No?
What's it like?

322
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:53,677
- It's like a brotherhood.

323
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:56,086
- The kind with the Nikes
and the aliens?

324
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,752
- Look, they're just--

325
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,062
they're just trying to keep me
out of jail, that's all.

326
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,459
- How?

327
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:08,560
- You know, legal advice,

328
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:10,331
and they know how to work
the courts or whatever.

329
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,970
- And what's their angle?

330
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,109
- Beth.

331
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:24,081
- Wait, you're gonna sell out
your own wife?

332
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,117
- I mean...

333
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,613
it's not like she ever
had my back.

334
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:30,087
- Whoa, no, no, no, no.
Hold on.

335
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,122
- What, she just gets
to destroy my family?

336
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,552
Why, 'cause she's the mom?

337
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:35,422
- She's not the only one
in this.

338
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:38,260
- Look, I will protect Ruby.
I promise.

339
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,461
- What if that's not up to you?

340
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:41,725
- That's why I have to make
sure it all sticks to Beth.

341
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,698
That's heavy, man.

342
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,770
- That's why I need your help.

343
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,510
- Uh, what can I do?

344
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:59,083
- You got eyes and ears.

345
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,119
If something doesn't, you know,
look or sound right,

346
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,154
just pass it along.

347
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,815
- Uh, even if I could--

348
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,223
- I know how close
you guys are.

349
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,324
- It's not that.

350
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,722
- But you don't do anything,

351
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:14,032
you're gonna be wearing
one of these things too.

352
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,038
- No, that's not my kinda look.

353
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:24,537
- Good thing is, I've...

354
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,176
got something
for the chafing.

355
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,544
- Can we please
pick our teams now?

356
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,150
- Yes.
- Thank you.

357
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,718
- Who's gonna do the holograms?
- I don't know.

358
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:42,687
- 'Cause I don't do that.
- I'll do it.

359
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,623
- You do the color.
- I can do both.

360
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:48,330
- It'll take twice as long.
- We'll figure it out.

361
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:53,302
- I just talked to her
last night.

362
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,536
- You talk to her every night.

363
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:57,438
- I accused her of stealing
my blender, which she denied,

364
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,341
and so I thought
she really did it,

365
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,837
and then she got defensive,

366
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,575
so then it turned into this
whole passive-aggressive thing,

367
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,280
which it is always does,

368
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:09,483
that had nothing to do with
the blender in the first place.

369
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:13,553
- You're gonna get
your blender back.

370
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,791
- Just maybe not right away.

371
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:31,241
.

372
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,909
- It went back to the city.
- How?

373
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:35,179
- It says he owes
a bunch of property taxes.

374
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,444
- Sounds like Gene.

375
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,776
- He's gonna lose a whole club
over, like,

376
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:43,253
9 grand?
- Sounds like Gene.

377
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,256
All you gotta do
is pay his back taxes.

378
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,753
- What, like, first dibs?

379
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,559
- Yeah, city doesn't want
to get stuck with that dump.

380
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:54,462
- Well, we don't have enough
anyway.

381
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,711
- Family first, right?

382
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,299
- Hey.

383
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,300
Whatcha doing?

384
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,598
- Couldn't sleep.

385
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:34,500
- You want a snack?

386
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,669
- I already housed
all your chips.

387
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,705
- I can get more tomorrow.
- Thanks.

388
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,774
- Okay.

389
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,281
Good night.

390
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,415
- Aunt Beth?
- Yeah?

391
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,450
- Was she always like this?

392
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,527
What do you mean?

393
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,562
- Just, like, drops everything

394
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,597
to run off to Mackinac
with some rando.

395
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,865
- Well, I don't know
how rando he is.

396
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,472
- I've never met him.
- Maybe she didn't want

397
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,309
to bring him around
until it was serious, you know?

398
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,345
- I mean, she just does
whatever she wants

399
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,347
whenever she wants.

400
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,680
- Well,
that's totally your mom.

401
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:21,879
- So not cool.

402
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,815
- She's very impulsive...
- Yeah.

403
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,686
- Not the most responsible.
- Like, at all.

404
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:28,820
- She's a train wreck.
- Yeah.

405
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:32,857
- But you know that's what
makes her so great, right?

406
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:35,464
- Huh?

407
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,796
- When we were little,

408
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:40,469
life was kind of a bummer,

409
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:45,705
but she found a way
to make it all fun.

410
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,606
- Like how?

411
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:51,480
- Like, a million
different ways, but...

412
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:54,549
so we never went anywhere
for spring break, right?

413
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,684
And one year she decided
that we should spend the night

414
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,390
in the camping section
at Target.

415
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,689
- Did you get caught?
- Yes, we got caught.

416
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:06,957
But she also convinced
the security guard

417
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,497
to order us a pizza

418
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,059
and let us watch
"Fried Green Tomatoes"

419
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,534
in the home theater section.

420
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,866
- She makes me watch that
every spring break.

421
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,934
- She can turn anything
into a party.

422
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:19,607
- Literally.

423
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:24,447
- She just doesn't know
when to leave.

424
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:27,516
I wish I was more like her,
honestly.

425
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,949
- Is this new guy cool?

426
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:34,424
He thinks he is.

427
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,494
- At least she's having fun.

428
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:43,796
- Yeah.

429
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,699
Get some sleep, bud.

430
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:06,918
Almost heaven,
West Jamaica

431
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:08,557
- Hit me.

432
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:10,427
- I think you've had enough.

433
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,121
- One more.

434
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,892
- I'm not doing nothing again.

435
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,861
- I can't do it.
- Try.

436
00:22:15,896 --> 00:22:17,830
- It's too dangerous
while I'm driving.

437
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:20,404
- It's upsetting.

438
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,065
- Don't make me pull over.

439
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,498
How much longer?

440
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,565
- Stop asking.

441
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,698
- Then tell me.

442
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:54,064
- You'll know
when we get there.

443
00:22:56,937 --> 00:22:59,476
- You know, you are making
a big mistake.

444
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,478
- Look, you think
I wanna be here?

445
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,810
- It's your job.
- It's my day off.

446
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,174
- Well, whatever.

447
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:08,452
Then your boss
is making a huge mistake.

448
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,717
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

449
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:15,756
'Cause good luck making money
without me.

450
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:20,156
My my lady, swingin'
through the water, water

451
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:24,798
painted on the sky

452
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:28,505
tears gone from my eyes

453
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,166
- What makes you so important?

454
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,937
- I basically do everything.

455
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:33,906
I'm, like, the brains
behind the operation.

456
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,583
- He doesn't see it that way.

457
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:46,556
- Well,
then he's sorely mistaken,

458
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,856
because I basically do it all.
I--I do.

459
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:52,023
I'm the one who--
I do the blender thing,

460
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:54,531
and I do the holograph,
the shiny part.

461
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,730
That's me as well.

462
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:59,030
I'm the one cuts
the sheets into bills.

463
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,537
- That doesn't sound hard.

464
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,737
- Oh, it doesn't?
Well, it is hard.

465
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:05,542
Do you think people are buying
sheets of money?

466
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,104
No, because it wouldn't fit
into their wallet!

467
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:12,241
It has to be cut!

468
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:34,571
here we go

469
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,560
come on

470
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:02,126
- You know who the really
important people are?

471
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,064
- The ones who
don't have to tell you

472
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,736
how important they are.

473
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:17,306
- Sidwell number
09-875-688-4.

474
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,583
14-unit apartment building.

475
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,949
Back taxes of $21,800.

476
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:24,984
Do I have any bids?

477
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:28,889
- Okay, moving on.

478
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:34,994
Sidwell number
02-467-8895-3.

479
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:36,292
Banquet hall,

480
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:40,934
back taxes of $12,482.

481
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,001
- Right here.

482
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:45,037
- Any other bids?

483
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:47,941
Pick up your title at the table
and pay the cashier.

484
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,880
- Oh, my God.

485
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:54,310
Ruby, hi.

486
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,081
I didn't know
you were in real estate.

487
00:25:56,116 --> 00:25:57,984
- I'm not.
We, uh--

488
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,821
- We're paying a tax bill.
- Yeah.

489
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:01,086
- What do you guys do?

490
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,320
- Hey, great bag.

491
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,959
- Oh, she's the one
with the hookup.

492
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:08,060
- Her son's a mathlete
with Harry.

493
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:09,294
- Oh.

494
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,196
- By the way, how did Barnaby
Prep kill us at semifinals?

495
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:13,670
- I keep telling Harry,

496
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,935
"You can't win
until you learn how to lose."

497
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,969
- Well, they're gonna learn
real fast

498
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:17,872
if they keep getting
those quadratic equations.

499
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:23,372
- Sidwell number
82-667-823-09.

500
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,813
Crap.

501
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:26,617
- Adult entertainment center,

502
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:30,687
back taxes of $9,172.

503
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,656
Do I have a--
- Here.

504
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,859
- Any other bids?

505
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:41,126
- $9,200.

506
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:43,227
I didn't see this one.

507
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:45,328
- $9,300?
- Yes.

508
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:46,967
- $9,400.

509
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:53,171
That's all we have.

510
00:26:53,206 --> 00:26:55,371
- Do I hear $9,500?

511
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,647
- You already have one!

512
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,110
- It's just such a steal.

513
00:26:58,145 --> 00:27:00,178
- Yeah, from us.

514
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:03,786
- Well, you can't win
until you learn how to lose.

515
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:06,250
- Anyone else?

516
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,153
Anyone?

517
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,155
Pay the cashier.

518
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,289
- See you at school.

519
00:27:12,324 --> 00:27:13,961
- Your bag's a fake.

520
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,673
- Okay, moving on.
Sidwell number...

521
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:31,077
.

522
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:33,112
- Morning, sunshine.

523
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,888
What are we doing here?

524
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,252
- Paying our respects.

525
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:45,124
- To who?
The cast of "Cocoon"?

526
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:47,060
- Skittles.

527
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:51,295
- Oh, my God.
- Skittles.

528
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,165
- He helps old people?

529
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,069
- I don't know about that,

530
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:57,675
but he won't steal from them
no more.

531
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,175
Now can I please
have my Skittles?

532
00:28:13,154 --> 00:28:14,692
Sit tight.

533
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,864
- Hey, where is he?
- Out back.

534
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,104
- Hey, big-time.

535
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,809
- Hard at work, huh?

536
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,944
- Love what you do,
never work a day in your life.

537
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:11,782
- You're not making things
easy for me.

538
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,850
- Nope.
- What are you thinking?

539
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,150
- Had to do what I had to do.
- Oh.

540
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:19,889
Oh, that's playing
it smart?

541
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,991
- Ball.

542
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,520
See, while y'all
are over there planting trees

543
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,929
or doing
whatever the hell you're doing,

544
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:29,393
I'm losing money.

545
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,263
- What about the position
you put me in?

546
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:33,397
- Aw, you have a lovers' spat?

547
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:35,036
- I was making progress.

548
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:38,006
- My money can't wait.

549
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:41,372
See that's always
been your problem.

550
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:42,912
You never were
a big-picture guy.

551
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,276
- 'Cause I don't see it
your way, right?

552
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:45,915
No.

553
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,885
You never did.

554
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,283
It's like they say....
- What's that?

555
00:29:51,318 --> 00:29:52,856
- Keep your eye on the ball.

556
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:57,960
- You know what else they say?

557
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:00,193
- I feel like
you're gonna tell me.

558
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,428
- Hit them where it hurts.

559
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:06,936
- I hope you're right.

560
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,135
- Ball.

561
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,873
- Later, brother.

562
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,305
-

563
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:28,254
- You hear that?

564
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:29,992
- The motorcycle?

565
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:34,062
- No, not that.

566
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:37,065
- I don't hear anything.

567
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,166
- Exactly.

568
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,069
Because Annie's not
in the back seat

569
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:43,467
asking us if we'd rather die
of a 1,000 bee stings

570
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:46,437
or be mauled by a bear.
- That one's her fave.

571
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,208
- Yeah, 'cause she thinks
there's a right answer.

572
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:49,605
- Bees.

573
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:52,949
- The bear.

574
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,480
- Bees.

575
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:58,482
'Cause eventually you go numb,

576
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,286
and you don't feel it anymore.

577
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:02,024
- The bear's way faster.

578
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,456
- Not if starts at your feet
and works its way up.

579
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:08,525
- What if the bees decide
to sting you one at a time?

580
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,395
- Like they're waiting in line
at the DMV?

581
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,070
- If she was here,
she would settle it.

582
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:18,502
- No, she'd tell us
we were both wrong.

583
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,911
- It's just weird
not having her around.

584
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,281
- It'd be weird
not having you around either.

585
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:35,552
- He told you?

586
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:41,360
- You should never have had
to make that deal.

587
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:44,264
- Come on.

588
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,233
- Seriously.

589
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:48,367
- No boy's gonna break us up.

590
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,673
- Say you were allergic
to bees...

591
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:07,155
- Fine.
Bees.

592
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,124
Now let's go get Annie back.

593
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,128
- Okay.

594
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,031
- She's here right now.

595
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,430
Yep, replace the floors,
a little paint,

596
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,564
this place will be up
and running in 30 days.

597
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,436
Gotta call you back.

598
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:25,569
- How's it all looking?

599
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:28,176
- Better than my knockoff bag.
- Mm.

600
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,705
- 'Cause we don't think this
is the right place for you.

601
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,740
- I'm gonna need a refund
by the way.

602
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:34,380
- You know how they say
a space chooses you?

603
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,052
- This one chose us.

604
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,186
- You're not a right fit.

605
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:41,255
What's this?
- Our offer.

606
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,487
- To take it off your hands.

607
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:45,061
- Well, this is way less
than I paid.

608
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,492
- Yeah, we're trying to get it
for a steal.

609
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:49,164
- All set in here.

610
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:53,201
- I can't do this right now.
My inspector's here.

611
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,401
- Quite a place you got here.

612
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:57,733
- Right?

613
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,142
- I used to get my groove on
back in the day.

614
00:33:00,177 --> 00:33:01,440
- Right?

615
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:03,244
Well, now it's gonna be
a dog hotel.

616
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,313
- Aw, might be cheaper to house
them at the Four Seasons.

617
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:08,348
- Excuse me?

618
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:11,681
- Plumbing, electrical, ADA,
I gotta dock you for all of it.

619
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:14,057
- What?
That's ridiculous.

620
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,487
- Oh, yeah,
I'm just getting started.

621
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:16,752
Fire suppression, asbestos,

622
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:17,820
and I don't know
what you got going on

623
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:22,230
with that tinkler back there.
It's all gotta go.

624
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:25,068
- Excuse me, ma'am.

625
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,333
You dropped this.

626
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:27,730
- Oh.

627
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:29,765
Sweet of you, hon.
- Mm-hmm.

628
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:06,175
- My mom found me this morning
in our driveway.

629
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:10,410
- I've never seen this guy
in my life.

630
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:12,181
- You bashed my face in.

631
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,084
- I don't know
what he's talking about.

632
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,118
- Look at his hand.

633
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,650
- I cut it shaving.
- Your knuckles?

634
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,289
- She knows,
she was in his car.

635
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:22,719
She saw the whole thing.

636
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:28,131
- Ma'am, do you know this guy?

637
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,497
- Yeah.

638
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:38,636
.

639
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,706
- Were you with him last night?

640
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:45,709
Did you witness anything?

641
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:47,381
- Yeah.

642
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,421
First-degree murder.
- Pardon?

643
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,100
- Of my vagina.

644
00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:05,531
- What's that now?

645
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:08,204
- Kinda like Lizzie Borden
with the hatchet,

646
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,502
except the hatchet it his--

647
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:10,866
- So he didn't assault
this man?

648
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:15,211
Trust me, officer, he wouldn't
have had the energy.

649
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,476
- Oh, my God.
She's lying.

650
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,610
- We haven't even left
our motel room in days.

651
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,744
- You sure you don't have
the wrong guy?

652
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:23,351
- Who else would look like him?

653
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:24,616
- A lot of people say I look
like the guy

654
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:25,383
from "Lord of the Rings."

655
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:27,883
Baby, I'm starving.

656
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:31,656
Let's go get
our electrolytes up.

657
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:34,362
Are we free to go or what?

658
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,368
- How'd she do?

659
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:41,534
- Well, Megan Thee Stallion
called,

660
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:42,931
and she's
her new backup dancer.

661
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,274
- Um, no, she's gonna be
my backup dancer.

662
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,374
- Ah, okay.

663
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:48,409
- Go wash up.
It's taco night.

664
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,810
- How'd it go?
- We're back in the club.

665
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:56,285
- I knew you'd get it.

666
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,419
- I gotta go print.

667
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,487
Make sure Harry doesn't eat
all the taco shells.

668
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,557
So, uh, whose name is it in?

669
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,529
Ah, she's not going anywhere
is she?

670
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:10,860
- Nuh-uh.

671
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:13,533
- Mm, family first, huh?

672
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,502
- Now you're getting it, Hill.

673
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:19,704
Okay.
- Good to see you.

674
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:22,674
- Bye.
- Bye, babe.

675
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:34,686
I knew it.

676
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:41,231
No, thanks.

677
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,233
- For back there.

678
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:47,699
- Oh.

679
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:09,490
- Running would've
made more sense.

680
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:13,329
- Well...

681
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,528
we couldn't have you
getting arrested

682
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,299
in front of your grandpa,
could we?

683
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,433
- Not my grandpa.

684
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,831
- Well, then who is he?

685
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:22,866
- We called him the janitor.

686
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:24,637
- Oh, no.

687
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:27,706
- Did cleanup.

688
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:28,640
- Cleanup?

689
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:30,676
- Anything that needed
to be dissolved...

690
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:31,809
- Okay.

691
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:35,010
- Then flushed.
- Got it.

692
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,287
- But he was like a grandpa.

693
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,554
- That's sweet.

694
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:43,920
- The kinda guy you want
to do things for.

695
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:45,559
Like that sister of yours.

696
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:48,661
- It's not the same thing.

697
00:37:48,696 --> 00:37:50,630
- Mm.

698
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:53,468
How can one bitch have
such a hold on so many people?

699
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,800
- She's not all that.

700
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,837
- Then why are we both here?

701
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,023
- Let's call the ladies.

702
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:41,289
- He should've taken me.

703
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:43,764
- He never will.

704
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:51,035
- I need career advice.

705
00:41:57,945 --> 00:41:59,714
- No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

706
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,144
What about--
what about, uh, uh, lip balm?

707
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:03,619
- Oh, forget lip balm.
