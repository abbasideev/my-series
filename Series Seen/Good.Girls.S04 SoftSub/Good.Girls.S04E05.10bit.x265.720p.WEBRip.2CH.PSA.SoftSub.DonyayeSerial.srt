‐ Psst.

179
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,400
I'll take that sauce,
if you offering.

180
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,603
‐ Dean hides junk food.

181
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,443
Where were you last night?

182
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
What are you doing?

183
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,711
‐ You better watch your back.

184
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,976
‐ Maybe he doesn't know.

185
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,644
‐ At a minimum,

186
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,980
he suspects.

187
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,648
I read about this lady

188
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,317
who turned on her drug dealer
in Florida.

189
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,820
‐ Stop reading those.
‐ Wired up.

190
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,114
Surveillance helicopter
tracked her.

191
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,323
The whole shebang.

192
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,491
‐ That doesn't mean
it's gonna be us.

193
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,828
‐ They found her stuffed
in a suitcase.

194
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,789
‐ I can't.

195
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,374
‐ She was shot

196
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,003
with the gun that
the cops sent her to buy.

197
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,839
‐ I cannot.

198
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,424
‐ At the airport.

199
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,136
‐ How is this helping?

200
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,513
‐ She was his carry‐on.

201
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,142
‐
‐ It's like...

202
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,519
I give him the baba, 'cause
he acts like he wants it,

203
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,021
but then he doesn't want it.

204
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,981
And then, when I take it away,
he wants it again.

205
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,691
Like, what?

206
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,694
‐ Why'd you bring him here?
‐

207
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,699
I've tried everything.

208
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,783
‐ Excuse me?

209
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,118
‐ I mean,
there's heavy machinery.

210
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,371
‐ I mean, I've gone all Harvey
Karp on his ass at this point.

211
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,249
I mean, with the shushing and
the swaddling and the shaking.

212
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,751
‐ Shaking's not one of 'em.

213
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,337
‐ This is exactly
why I need you.

214
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,130
Oh‐‐oh, now you want it.

215
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,381
‐ We have bigger problems here.

216
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,716
‐ Will you just give it to him,
please?

217
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
‐ No way, this is a sick,
twisted little game

218
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,221
he's playing,
and I'm not gonna give in.

219
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,807
‐ Give me that.
‐ What?

220
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,563
‐ What's up your butt?

221
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,483
‐ I'll tell you what isn't.

222
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,736
‐ Oh...huh.

223
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,488
‐ What?

224
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,324
‐ I don't know.
It's just not what I imagined.

225
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,992
‐ What did you imagine?

226
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,495
‐ I don't know.
Something sleeker.

227
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,624
This is kind of giving me,
like, '90s pager vibes.

228
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,792
‐ She's not wrong.

229
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,086
‐ I mean, not something
to track a car.

230
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,421
‐
‐ God.

231
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,632
‐ Kid's hungry.

232
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,429
You got a bottle?

233
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,598
‐
I...

234
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,433
It's...

235
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,936
‐ Seconds count.

236
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,272
Shh.
Got a lovey?

237
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,274
‐ What is‐‐what's a‐‐

238
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,608
oh, that.

239
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,111
‐ Shh.

240
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,862
You're not gonna need those.

241
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,284
‐ He doesn't want the drop?

242
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,121
‐ It's not drop day.

243
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,498
‐ What day is it?

244
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,083
‐ Hey, just go get in the car.

245
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,131
‐ Um, she‐‐she can't.

246
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,300
‐ I can't.

247
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,759
‐ And why is that?

248
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,556
‐ The baby.

249
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,641
‐ What about it?

250
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,979
‐ I can't be left alone
with him.

251
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,606
‐ And what about you?
‐ My kids are grown.

252
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,821
‐ Then this won't be fun.

253
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,490
‐ "Seafare Pool and Patio."

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,659
Hmm.
That sounds nice.

255
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,161
‐ Back on the horse.

256
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,955
‐ Do what you love, you
don't work a day in your life.

257
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,708
‐ Too bad my boss
is such a D‐I‐C‐K.

258
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,501
‐ You can swear in here.

259
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,336
‐
She's the worst.

260
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,089
‐ She can't be worse
than Gayle.

261
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,343
Are you kidding me?

262
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,345
‐ Who else would hire me?

263
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,680
‐

264
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,932
Bet she loves that I'm in here.

265
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,274
‐ Well, made any friends?

266
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,693
‐ It's not a frat.

267
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,362
‐ At least you get to work out.
‐ Mm‐mm.

268
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,948
You have to be in the Blood
Lords to use the equipment.

269
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,536
‐ Well, what about classes,
you know, like art?

270
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,747
You know, pass the time?

271
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,374
‐ We can't use paintbrushes
anymore.

272
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,710
‐ Why?
‐ This lifer.

273
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,171
He plucked the guard's eyeball
out with one.

274
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,466
‐ Ooh...that's raw, dawg.

275
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,472
‐ I gotta get out of here, man.

276
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,725
‐ Well, how's Beth doing
with the bail?

277
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,228
‐
I think she wants me in here.

278
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,729
King me.

279
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,731
‐ Why would she want that?

280
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,234
‐ So she can hump the tats
off her boyfriend.

281
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,821
‐ Hmm.

282
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,579
I'm gonna get you out.

283
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,291
‐ How are you gonna score
100 grand?

284
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,918
‐ Let me worry about that.

285
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,587
‐ You live in a basement.
‐ You're my best friend.

286
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,423
‐ With a roommate.

287
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,801
‐ Your move.

288
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,179
‐ Are you letting me win?

289
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,690
‐ Don't get too comfy in here.

290
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,786
‐ Oh, no, no.
No, I'm good, man.

291
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,789
‐ Come on.
Join me.

292
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,499
‐ Ah, you know,
it's the middle of the day.

293
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,293
‐ That's why
I don't wear a watch.

294
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,628
Come on.

295
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,974
‐ Yeah.

296
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,523
‐ You're a good guy, Stan.

297
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,279
‐ Yeah.
Thanks.

298
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,489
‐ You're funny.

299
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,241
You know how to talk to people.

300
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,498
Not too bad on the eyes,
either.

301
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,126
‐ What's that?
‐ You work out?

302
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,669
‐ Uh, yeah.

303
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,588
You know, I hit the gym
when I can.

304
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,797
‐ Bet those girls at the club

305
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,799
can't keep their hands off you,
huh?

306
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,177
Stanimal!
Huh?

307
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,846
‐ Hey, man, there's no touching
in the champagne room.

308
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,557
‐ Don't gotta worry about me.

309
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,648
‐ Who I gotta worry about?
Jane?

310
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,943
‐ Someone I want to be
in business with.

311
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,281
‐ Why me?

312
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,992
‐ I can't seem to close her.

313
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,703
‐ I have a wife.
‐ Oh.

314
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,747
Oh, the bitch
who stole my money.

315
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,915
‐ Come on now.

316
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,375
‐ I'd be happy
to put her to work,

317
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,168
if you're not up to it.

318
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,887
She's in room 216.

319
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,722
‐ What's the deal?

320
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,976
‐

321
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,237
‐ It's easier
if you put it on the side.

322
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,574
‐ What, are you on crack?

323
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,242
‐ She is not.

324
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,495
‐ The middle's the safest spot
in the vehicle.

325
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,747
‐ Whatever works.

326
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,793
‐ Let's roll.

327
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,674
‐ Y'all realize we're using
a baby as a human shield.

328
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:35,091
‐

329
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,913

330
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,457
and this.

331
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,128
‐ Why can't he do it?

332
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,088
‐ Boss is laying low.

333
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,758
‐ And why can't you do it?

334
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,217
‐ You're the banker.

335
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,144
‐ Maybe it'll be okay.

336
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,396
‐ How so?

337
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,235

whoever's waiting behind that
door is gonna take you out.

he took the tracker,

where we are.

I'm the banker?

359
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,152
‐ Is she alive?
‐ No.

360
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,613
‐ What?
‐ No, it's Nancy.

361
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,241
She wants proof of life.

362
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,243
Oi...okay.

363
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,502
‐ Could have used one of those
from Stan.

364
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,671
‐ Why?
Where's he at?

365
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,965
‐ Not anywhere he says he is.

366
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,175
‐ I thought he, like,
lived at work.

367

369
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,767
‐ Um, Sweet P.'s.

370
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,603
‐
The place with the shaved ham?

371
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,189
‐ Oh, whoa!
We prefer "gentleman's club."

372
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,483
‐ Why?

373
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,278

or am I?

00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,988

375
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,703

how to show their appreciation.
