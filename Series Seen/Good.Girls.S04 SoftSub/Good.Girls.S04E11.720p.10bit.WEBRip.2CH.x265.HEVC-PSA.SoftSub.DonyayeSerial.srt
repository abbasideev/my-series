00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,032
You're not supposed
to be here.

3
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:08,062
Yeah, neither are you.

4
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:09,525
This is the only way
we're gonna turn this around.

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,899
How does helping him
help me?

6
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:12,754
Saving up to run.

7
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:13,976
I'd rather have a lawyer.

8
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,297
We've never made you smile
like all this just did.

9
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:18,415
Because I told you,
this is what gets us out.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,883
No, that's
what gets you off.

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,987
This whole time,
I thought he was the problem.

12
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,415
He's just the excuse.

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,078
Anyone who wears
a cardigan

14
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:26,427
shouldn't be doing
what he does.

15
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,554
- What are you, a priest?
- Just trying to help.

16
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:29,959
You got my wife shot.

17
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:31,656
I got you
your money.

18
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,469
Last party, I had to be
the damn go-between

19
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:34,806
for my husband
and my best friend.

20
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,875
I want you
out of her life.

21
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,830
You get us in that club,
and she'll never see me again.

22
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,625
- What's going on with you?
- My wife was laundering

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,875
a gang's money
through my business.

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,055
- What happened to her?
- Not a damn thing.

25
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:48,109
- You still coming to the game?
- Dude, I wouldn't miss it.

26
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:50,233
So he's back in?

27
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:51,867
- What do you want from me?
I caved.

28
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,888
- That Washington?
- The Queen.

29
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:55,250
I hate Canadians.

30
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:56,738
You said all we had
to do was print it.

31
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:57,695
And then drop it.

32
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,406

in our country.

84
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,301
How would we train
thousands of pigeons?

85
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,614
You only need one.

86
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,879
One pigeon's gonna carry all
that cash across the border?

87
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,012
Well, not all at once.

88
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,327
- Thank you, ladies.
- Y'all killed it tonight.

89
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:10,208
Uh, the launch sequence
was all messed up.

90
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:12,084
- What are you talking about?
That was the best part.

91
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,637
And then it felt like
no one got

92
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,200
the crawling on the ground
part.

93
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:16,184
Hello?

94
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,840
Obviously an homage to Sandy B
at the end of "Gravity."

95
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,489
Ah, love you, guys.

96
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,126
- Bye.
- Bye.

97
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,958
- Bye!
- Bye.

98
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,743
Hey, what about drones?

99
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,442
Like the ones they use
in Guadalajara for heroin?

100
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,705
Well, it's easier
than training a pigeon.

101
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,403
Yeah. And way less range.

102
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,654
Plus, you better pray
for perfect weather.

103
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,058
They have 'em
at Hobby Lobby.

104
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:45,412
But you know,
it can fly in a storm.

105
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:46,786
Let's go tomorrow.

106
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,153
I'm busy.

107
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,546
Okay, and we can look
into your bird too.

108
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:56,028
- No, no, I... I really am busy.
I... I have plans.

109
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,403
- Doing what?
- Jobbie Nooner, baby.

110
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,770
Aren't you a little old
for that?

111
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,645
Can you really put an age on
the Mardi Gras of the Midwest?

112
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,426
That's tomorrow?

113
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,412
Taking a "me" day,
so sue me.

114
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:11,856
No, no, no, no, no.

115
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,989
You're going to a party
on a boat...

116
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,982
that is literally
on the border of Canada?

117
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,607
Yeah, my buddy Tim just got
out of rehab, and we always go.

118
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,797
Where you don't have to go
through customs

119
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:28,153
and there's millions of boats

120
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:30,294
filled with tons
of drunk people

121
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,700
who aren't paying attention
to what anyone else is doing?

122
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,940
Okay. Okay.

123
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,463
Yes, I see where you're going
with this.

124
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,290
And it could work.

125
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:43,989
What was your friend
in rehab for?

126
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,126
Meth.

127
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,845
But they let him
keep the boat license.

128
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:52,080
- When do we set sail?
- You going on a boat?

129
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:55,914
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
For a girls' trip.

130
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,892
Where?

131
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:01,015
- Detroit River.
- Why?

132
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,558
Girl stuff.

133
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,860
- Pedicures.
- Waxing.

134
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:09,188
It's like
a day spa/sunset cruise.

135
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:10,537
Sounds shady.

136
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:11,756
I think it's how they dodge

137
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,672
all those health
department codes.

138
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,088
Yeah, is this one of those
"spa days" that

139
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:17,867
ends up with a bullet
in her other knee?

140
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,416
I'm just looking out
for my wife.

141
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:26,789
A little self-care
never hurt anybody.

142
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,523
I would never let anything
happen to my maid of honor.

143
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,101
That a promise?

144
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,015
Oh, we have a deal.

145
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,593
Mm-hmm.

146
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,531
Well, I think y'all look great.

147
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,562
Well, tell that to the alpaca
sitting on my crotch.

148
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:55,645
Well, it got him out of here,
didn't it?

149
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,566
- Hey.
- Hey.

150
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,071
What... what's all this?

151
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,724
I thought we can
all eat together.

152
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,071
- Why?
- For a change.

153
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:12,540
- Ah.
Well, Ben's at his dad's.

154
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:15,817
Well,
then it's dinner a deux.

155
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:18,942
Okay.

156
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:23,480
It's a pretty fancy setup
for tortillas and soy sauce.

157
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:27,353
- Not what we're having.
- That's all I have.

158
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,268
Lemon chicken piccata.

159
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,927
- What?
You made this?

160
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,811
Well, it's not Olive Garden,

161
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:35,865
but it's the best
with what I could find.

162
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,041
Jeez.

163
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,844
What the hell is this?
A white carrot?

164
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:41,619
Parsnip, and...

165
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,500
- Mmm.
- A few other root veggies.

166
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:45,763
- It's so good.
- Thanks, man.

167
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,591
- No, thank you, man.
- No, no.

168
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,506
Thank you for letting me crash.

169
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,388
No, thank you
for picking all this up.

170
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,390
NBD.

171
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,165
I mean,
must have been expensive.

172
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,607
Not at all.

173
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,600
I mean, last I checked,
food was not free.

174
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,999
Well, maybe you're just not
looking in the right place.

175
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,003
- Kevin...
- Mm.

176
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:11,615
I went a little heavy
on the rosemary.

177
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,443
Where did you get this food?

178
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:15,923
- Kroger.
- Oh, thank Jesus.

179
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,230
Yeah, they throw out
the best stuff.

180
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:20,505
Like even before it goes bad.

181
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,952
Eww.
What is wrong with you?

182
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,739
It's fine.

183
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:28,946
It's trash food.

184
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,481
- You never would have known.
- Mm, except I do.

185
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:35,247
So if I paid,
would it taste better?

186
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,047
I mean, I guess not.

187
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:39,917
- Then what's the difference?
- The amount of E. coli.

188
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,255
- I washed it.
- Where, in the toilet?

189
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,640
I thought you were
cooler than this.

190
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:51,587
Why, because I'm not down
with gourmet dumpster diving?

191
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,606
No, because you think money
makes everything better.

192
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,854
- Doesn't it?
- All right. Yeah, sure.

193
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,833
If you want to live
for what you don't have.

194
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:01,184
- Oh, boy, here we go.
- This treadmill you're on...

195
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:04,580
- Excuse me for wanting more.
- Won't get you anywhere.

196
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,820
It's called
the American dream, baby.

197
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,517
Okay, well,
while you're dreaming,

198
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,172
you're also sleeping through a
pretty choice piece of chicken.

199
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:15,608
At least I won't
have hepatitis A, B, or C.

200
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:18,522
Whatever.

201
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,186
I won't tell you
where I got that.

202
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:34,553
Hey, guys. I thought we were
meeting down at the park.

203
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:35,998
Oh, guys can wait.

204
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,365
You're not going anywhere
with that derailer.

205
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:39,607
Let me see that.

206
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,873
Hey, look.

207
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,301
Sorry, I'm doing everything
I can with that night cream.

208
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:45,826
Oh, I get it.

209
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,574
Guys don't really like stuff
on their face before bed.

210
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,926
Right?
Gets stuff all over your pillow and...

211
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,412
Not why we're here.

212
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,235
Oh.

213
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,420
The other night
at the meeting...

214
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:58,928
- Yeah, I overshared.
- It was beautiful, Dean.

215
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:03,529
You're going through
a lot right now, you know?

216
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,287
You got a lawyer?

217
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,483
Not one that's gonna
keep me out of jail?

218
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,478
Well, you do now.

219
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:15,902
Oh.

220
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,349
Oh, that's so cool.

221
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,248
Never lost a case.

222
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,240
Which is
why

223
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:27,154
I definitely
can't afford him.

224
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,708
Don't worry about it.

225
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,873
Dean,
you're family now.

226
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,951
That bitch has
done enough to you.

227
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,107
Hi, boys.

228
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:46,249
Pulled them
out of the freezer

229
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,990
so they got that
big ice cube you like.

230
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,271
Thanks.

231
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,395
Do you guys want a refill?

232
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,137
- No, we're fine.
- Good.

233
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,833
Don't forget to wear
the reflective stuff.

234
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,412
We'll look out for him.

235
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:06,024
Oh, Danny's hockey game
got rescheduled.

236
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:08,027
I got him a ride
with the Simpson kid.

237
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:09,896
You just need
to pick him up.

238
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,247
Sure.

239
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:23,271
Saddle up, cowboy.

240
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,505
Take a bunch
so you can layer.

241
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,498
All right, here.

242
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,554
We're not here to party.

243
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,510
So you'd rather stick out?

244
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,736
I just want to make a run
for the border.

245
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,940
Yeah, well,
that's why you gotta blend.

246
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,325
Where is your friend?

247
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,432
He's probably just
gassing up the boat.

248
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,549
Sure this is the right place?

249
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,073
It's where we park
every year.

250
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:56,182
What if I have to pee
on the water?

251
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,471
Well, get it all out now.

252
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,875
Where?

253
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,900
It's also where we pee
every year.

254
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:04,950
Is that your guy?

255
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,307
Oh, here we go.

256
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:17,025
Mm-mm.
Nope.

257
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,114
- What are you doing?
- It's an open container.

258
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:23,683
We have a cooler full
of Canadian counterfeit.

259
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,166
Will you please
just act chill?

260
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:28,586
- He's coming.
- Okay, music on or off?

261
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,199
- On, on.
<i>- ♪ Where my stash at?</i>

262
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,329
- Off, off, off.
<i>- ♪ Taking big time...</i>

263
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,346
- Mike?
- Hey, Ruby.

264
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,511
What's going on?

265
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:54,549
What's in that?

266
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:58,611
A whole lot of fun.

267
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,808
Yeah,
it's her first Jobbie Nooner,

268
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:03,086
so, we went all out.

269
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,180
Open it on up.

270
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,960
You know, if this is about
the parking or something,

271
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,656
we could pull up...
What's in the cooler?

272
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,743
You put your boy on me?

273
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,214
You're welcome.

274
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,788
He gave Beth a ticket.

275
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,269
- Yeah.
Lucky that's all she got.

276
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,338
We could have just
slipped over.

277
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,271
Not on the weekend,

278
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:31,067
where they triple
border patrol.

279
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,962
We were gonna bury it
and go back tomorrow.

280
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:34,962
This is brilliant.

281
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,228
Drive right through customs
and pick it up.

282
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:39,065
'Cause nobody's ever thought
of doing that on Gull Island.

283
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,892
Yeah, smugglers.

284
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,893
Not a bunch of moms.

285
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,439
Was that her angle?

286
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,876
I need it back.

287
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:49,509
What else you got?

288
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,661
I don't know.

289
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,400
Hmm.

290
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,373
Come see me when you do.

291
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,460
Who are you, my dad?

292
00:12:58,662 --> 00:12:59,943
No, you know,
I'm just worried

293
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:02,178
that's she's gonna come up
with something even dumber.

294
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:05,623
I'm not some kid you caught
with a case of beer.

295
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,990
This isn't just beer, Ruby.

296
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:12,014
I need to make that drop.

297
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,350
And I need to keep you
out of jail.

298
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,381
He's ready for you.

299
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,424
Now you don't look like
you're here

300
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:33,817
for the Sewer Expansion
meeting.

301
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,930
I'm not sure
I'd have a lot to offer.

302
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,530
Come on.

303
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,944
You know, they're actually
really interesting.

304
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,341
- Really?
- No.

305
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,517
Not at all.

306
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:46,428
So what can I do for you,
Elizabeth?

307
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:50,147
It's really stupid.

308
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,225
Oh, I've heard it all.

309
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,014
And it might be
crossing a line.

310
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,702
I'm okay with that.

311
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,928
It's kind of
more of a favor.

312
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,718
Is it a parking ticket?

313
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,413
- No.
- Okay, 'cause, you know,

314
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,475
people hit me up with that
all the time.

315
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:05,978
It's a trespassing ticket.

316
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,259
Oh.

317
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,236
Okay.

318
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,588
So what's next?
Burning Man?

319
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,572
It's a long story.

320
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,353
Try me.
I got time.

321
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,338
It's more of a thing for,
you know,

322
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:30,205
your brother cousin.

323
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,111
Him.

324
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,721
Which I can't explain
to a judge, so...

325
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:37,736
They're waiting for you

326
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:39,033
in the conference room.

327
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:45,689
You know what?
You're busy.

328
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,689
Look, it's just, um,

329
00:14:48,645 --> 00:14:53,653
I don't... I don't like
to get involved with his... "things."

330
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,275
I never should have asked.

331
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,314
Just puts me in a bad place,
you know?

332
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:00,170
Go to your meeting.

333
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:01,681
This never happened.
I'm an idiot.

334
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,057
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. No.

335
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:05,299
Hold on. Hold on.

336
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:07,916
I'll do it.

337
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,814
You really don't have to.

338
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,627
I really want to.

339
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,236
Come on.

340
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,416
- Thank you.
- But...

341
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,759
you're gonna have
to do something for me.

342
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,689
Yeah, what?

343
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:26,916
I wanna put you
to work.

344
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,463
- Please, no.
- Just try it.

345
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,814
I don't wanna release
whatever's trapped under there.

346
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,619
Don't you want to add rabies
to your hep A, B, and C?

347
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,595
I guess.

348
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,774
I'm scared.

349
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:58,674
What is this?

350
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,642
I'm no Shakespeare,
but I am sorry.

351
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,338
Let me take you out.

352
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:15,939
Why?

353
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,369
To make up
for the other night.

354
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,283
- Where?
- Restaurant.

355
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:23,767
A real one?

356
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:25,900
You like French?

357
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:28,970
Oui.

358
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,994
Ma'am.

359
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,611
This place is,
like, legit fancy.

360
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:37,533
- Oh, I know.
- Hey, Kev.

361
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,166
Hey, Ange.

362
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:40,877
You come here often?

363
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,525
All the time.

364
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,798
You have like a special table
or something?

365
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:47,799
Sort of.

366
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:02,970
Right this way, madame.

367
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,461
What is this?

368
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,336
This is dinner.

369
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,691
What are you doing?
Oh!

370
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,121
- Are you high?
- Little bit.

371
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:16,422
Oh, this three-course meal
right here.

372
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,555
- No way.
- One bite of each.

373
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,985
No, never.

374
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,133
- Not in hell.
- No.

375
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,223
I'll cook for you
for a month.

376
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,488
No, no, I don't want to be
eating your trash food.

377
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:27,430
Your food,

378
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:30,415
from whatever grocery store
you waste your money at.

379
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,985
No, bye!

380
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,508
Ben too.

381
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:39,344
Ben is not ever hungry.

382
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,672
Well, he eats
at his friend's house

383
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,899
so he doesn't have to at home.

384
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,064
One bite.

385
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:01,878
Well, I started
as a prep chef.

386
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,404
- Mm-hmm.
- And became a line cook.

387
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:07,887
And... and now
I just sort of sub in

388
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,633
whenever I need cash.

389
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:12,091
Wow.
Oh, forgot to ask.

390
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:15,634
What was the... it was like
a little brown chewy,

391
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,421
sausage-y, garlicy, butter
thing on the... on the toothpick.

392
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:21,712
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yeah.
That... that was a escargot.

393
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:24,798
Ah, escargot to you,
monsieur.

394
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,204
- Snails.
- What?

395
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:29,815
Yeah, see,
even from the garbage,

396
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,971
they're pretty great, right?

397
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:33,462
Ew! I never would have eaten
those, even inside.

398
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,048
That, my friend,
is exactly the point.

399
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,248
It doesn't matter.

400
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,462
Ugh.
Mmm!

401
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,587
Mm-mm.
Mm-hmm.

402
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,275
- Stop, stop, stop.
- What?

403
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,181
- What are you doing?
- I don't... I don't know.

404
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,087
You can't... you can't do that.

405
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:00,489
- Why not?
- Just...

406
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,892
Because it's... it's...
Because we're roommates.

407
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,034
So?

408
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,439
So it's not...
It's just...

409
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,665
It's too easy.

410
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,665
That wasn't in your rules.

411
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,907
We just... we can't, okay?

412
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:21,064
- All right.
- Um.

413
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:24,904
- I have to... I have to go.
- I'll walk you.

414
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,946
No, no, no. It's fine.
Just stay and enjoy the...

415
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:33,634
Well, I'll see you at home.

416
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:37,606
We get a PO Box.

417
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,461
Or whatever they
call it up there.

418
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:41,165
And just overnight it.

419
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:45,156
- Customs.
- Let 'em open it.

420
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:47,334
All they'll see is lots
and lots of Huggies.

421
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,689
Disguising, of course,
the cash.

422
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,751
Why would anybody want
to overnight diapers to Canada?

423
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:58,368
They use those cloth ones
up there.

424
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,657
I'm out.

425
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:04,104
You didn't want us involved
in the transport.

426
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:06,033
- Next.
- This is so low risk.

427
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,644
Yeah, until you're surrounded
by a bunch of Mounties

428
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,681
asking you why your Pampers
are so absorbent.

429
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,157
Huggies.

430
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:13,857
Hear me out.

431
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,722
There's a mini-submarine
called the Dolphin...

432
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:17,784
I thought we weren't
going to pitch this one.

433
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:20,071
No, you weren't gonna
pitch this one.

434
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,857
It's like 20 grand, Annie.

435
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,833
It's a lifelong
investment, Ruby.

436
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:26,032
You wanted one
way before we started all this.

437
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:27,675
Look, it's just so simple,
you know, we blend in

438
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:28,955
with the marine life,
we pop up,

439
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,130
we ditch the cash, we...

440
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,040
- This is ridiculous.
- Agreed.

441
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,392
Why do we have
to answer to you?

442
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,321
Oh.

443
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:39,370
How about my bag business,
my dancers, my club,

444
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:41,079
and what, my wife?

445
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,556
He makes some good points.

446
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:46,853
Are you ever gonna give us
our money back?

447
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,540
Well, not with these ideas.

448
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,728
Well, let's just sell
some bags then.

449
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,751
That's not gonna be necessary
this evening.

450
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:55,954
Why is that?

451
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,218
'Cause you're gonna need
these guys

452
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:58,884
to help you with your drop.

453
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:03,774
Hey.

454
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,748
How's it going?

455
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:13,345
Canadian dudes are
the most respectful.

456
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,454
Yeah?

457
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,142
My nipple popped out
too early,

458
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:18,236
and they all looked away.

459
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,414
- So we good?
- Oh, yeah.

460
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:22,809
They're not gonna ask
any questions.

461
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,158
That's it.

462
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,292
You better...
Yeah!

463
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:29,774
- Yeah.
Work all of that.

464
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,876
Our girls also dance
in Windsor.

465
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,290
- And?
- Fully nude, twice the money.

466
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:41,173
How does that help us?

467
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,201
They're real tight
with the border guards.

468
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,923
Ugh, Canadians.

469
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:08,869
Hey, how's it going?

470
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:10,329
IDs please.

471
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,568
Have we met?

472
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:25,845
I don't think so.

473
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:29,204
Oh, wait, no, you're... you're
Krystal's friend, right?

474
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:31,556
- That's it.
- Oh, yeah, Krystal.

475
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,047
You know, Krystal?

476
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,673
What's her real name?

477
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:36,939
She's actually right behind us.

478
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,978
- How do you guys know her?
- We met at the gym.

479
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:46,410
She teaches the most amazing
Zumba class.

480
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:48,728
She's so flexible, you know?

481
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:52,025
Yeah, well... yeah, I wouldn't
exactly call us friends.

482
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,165
Totally get it.

483
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:57,189
Um, where you guys
headed today?

484
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:58,931
We're gonna go see her dance.

485
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,095
#WomenSupportingWomen.

486
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,471
You should stop by.

487
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:06,866
Tell your wife you got
front row tickets

488
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,563
to the Windsor Ballet.

489
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,181
Well, I wish I could.

490
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:14,267
I... I got my kid's
violin concert, so...

491
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,892
Next time then.

492
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,713
All right,
you guys bringing anything in?

493
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:23,237
- Nope.
- Just us.

494
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:24,776
Great, then just pull over
right over there

495
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
and pop the trunk.

496
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,490
- But it's empty.
- Should be quick then.

497
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,204
Enjoy the show.

498
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:01,040
All right.
Good to go.

499
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:11,404
It's, like, no biggie at all.

500
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,010
Well,
we really appreciate it.

501
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,923
Anything to help a friend.

502
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,728
But we're gonna need
our expenses covered.

503
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,243
Thought this was a favor.

504
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,727
And what expenses?

505
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:27,596
You know, the cooler's super heavy,
so it uses more gas.

506
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,775
- Okay.
Can we just do this already?

507
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,430
Okay. How much?

508
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:33,117
5%.

509
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,977
Of what?

510
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:41,501
Um, just, like,
whatever's in the cooler.

511
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:46,368
- That's not our money.
- It's not our problem.

512
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,679
Okay, okay.

513
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:53,564
5%.

514
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:59,543
How are we gonna give them
5% of a cut we don't even have?

515
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,019
How are we gonna drop
a cooler that we don't have?

516
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:03,978
I don't like this SUV.

517
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,071
Why?
'Cause it's silver?

518
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:12,587
- 'Cause it hasn't moved.
- It is a parking lot.

519
00:26:14,494 --> 00:26:16,212
Let's roll, bitches.

520
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:18,954
How bad is it?

521
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,556
Remember Payne Stewart?

522
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:24,264
- Wasn't he a golfer?
- Try U.S. Open champion.

523
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,657
- Okay.
- He's up in his private jet,

524
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:29,103
right, on top of the world.

525
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,675
Tower loses communication.

526
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,236
So they scramble some F-16s
to check it out.

527
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:38,228
Turns out,
the hull was breached.

528
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,751
Everyone inside was
sound asleep from no oxygen.

529
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,134
So what'd they do?

530
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,946
Plane's on autopilot,
just cruising.

531
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:54,721
All they gotta do
is wake up.

532
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:00,407
And what happened?

533
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:04,064
After 3 1/2 hours,
it runs out of fuel

534
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,708
and they crash into a cornfield
in South Dakota.

535
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,681
Jesus.

536
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:14,240
But that's not gonna be you.

537
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,895
- I already pled guilty.
- I know.

538
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,440
And they wanna move
the trial date up.

539
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:18,658
Yeah.

540
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,743
So how do I not end up
in the cornfield?

541
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:23,853
Her.

542
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,462
It's not an option.

543
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:30,321
So are you the one
printing fake money?

544
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:31,886
I already know where
you're going with this.

545
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,712
Cooking the books?
Committing wire fraud?

546
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:35,236
I'm not gonna turn
on my wife.

547
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,689
She did it.

548
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,172
- I have kids.
- So?

549
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,790
They need their mother.

550
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:44,345
Oh.
Okay.

551
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,306
So what's Plan B?

552
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:52,165
Who taught them
how to ride their bikes?

553
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,602
I mean, I did.

554
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,939
Who taught your son
how to do a slapshot?

555
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,634
Worked on that for months.

556
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:04,116
Who built the treehouse
in your backyard?

557
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,634
I bet they'd say all that stuff
is pretty important too.

558
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:16,486
- There's no Plan B, man.
- Come on, you guys.

559
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,196
She didn't leave you
a parachute.

560
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,392
What am I supposed
to do here?

561
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:23,111
Wake up.

562
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,814
Prepare to turn left.

563
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:30,696
This left or next left?

564
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:33,673
Mm, looks like next left.

565
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,750
Oh.
Uh, no.

566
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,165
What's "uh, no"?

567
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,577
- It was the other left.
- Recalculating.

568
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,368
Where do I go now?

569
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:48,087
I don't know.
It's... it's recalculating.

570
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,933
Where is this stupid place?

571
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,650
Here, here, here.
Next left.

572
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,392
It's cool.
We got it.

573
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:57,767
We're not there yet.

574
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,353
You must admit, Stanimal did
deliver on this one.

575
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:03,111
Yeah.
Except for the shakedown part.

576
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,420
That wasn't his plan.

577
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,001
It wasn't our plan either.

578
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:09,275
Better than taking a jet ski.

579
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:12,571
Okay, I get that you need
to defend him.

580
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:13,965
I'm not defending him.

581
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,750
But he has not made
our life easier.

582
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:17,535
Aren't we in Canada
with the money?

583
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,032
That's defending him.

584
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,339
In 400 feet,
take the next left.

585
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,165
I thought you were
cool with him?

586
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:27,673
I am.

587
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:29,493
'Cause I know
he's cool with you.

588
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:31,368
Recalculating.

589
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,571
Would you please
tell me where to go?

590
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:36,298
- God, that is so weird.
- What?

591
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,415
It's just this guy...

592
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,936
Every time we make a move,
he does too.

593
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,634
- Oh, God.
- What?

594
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:43,290
- Silver SUV?
- Silver-ish.

595
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,190
That's the car
from the parking lot.

596
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,901
- Okay.
You don't know that.

597
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:51,618
Same plate.

598
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,142
In 100 feet,
please make a U-turn.

599
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,821
In 100 feet,
take the next left.

600
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:01,618
- What do we do?
- Just... just drive.

601
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:02,845
- Where?
- Just go, go.

602
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,907
- Please make the next left.
- Just turn that off.

603
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,659
- I'm trying.
- Please make a left turn.

604
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:07,767
God, she's persistent.

605
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:08,634
What about the drop?

606
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,017
- We can't stop.
- Recalculating.

607
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,276
The second we do, we'll be
surrounded by Mounties.

608
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,536
- Mounties ride horses.
- Not when they're undercover.

609
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,040
We don't know
that they're Mounties.

610
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,235
- Okay, border patrol.
As if that's better?

611
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,542
Maybe Krystal sold us out.

612
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:19,744
Stan wouldn't
let that happen.

613
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:21,572
- Stop defending him.
- Let's just dump it.

614
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:23,337
It's gang-friend's money!

615
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,822
You want to explain that
to the Mounties?

616
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,693
Either way,
we can't make the drop.

617
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:28,066
Well, at least, my way,
we don't end up

618
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,459
in an Ontario gulag.

619
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,892
- Okay, how do we dump it?
- Roll down the windows.

620
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:34,372
So what, we can make it rain
all over their windshield?

621
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,419
- Here. Turn, turn.
- Annie!

622
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:39,867
Jesus!

623
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,978
We can lose them in here.

624
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:43,720
- Pull in somewhere.
- Where are they?

625
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,158
Can you see them?

626
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,158
Just do something!

627
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,628
- Slow down! Slow down!
- Stop yelling at me!

628
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:57,174
Oh, my God!

629
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,339
Come on.

630
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,681
- Do you think they're gone?
- Coast is clear.

631
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:26,119
- Where'd you learn all that?
- YouTube.

632
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,990
And they're back.

633
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,814
Grab the money.

634
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,744
- Why?
- Come on. Just do it.

635
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,720
No, no, no, just take it out
and divide it up.

636
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,023
What are we doing?

637
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,852
Getting rid of it.

638
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,244
Where?

639
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:58,666
<i>Mai Ian's "Dial My Number"...</i>

647
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:17,730
- Now, Annie?
- To flush the money, Beth.

648
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:19,604
- There's eyes in the sky.
They see everything.

649
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,720
So how do we dump it?

650
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:23,983
We don't.

651
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,998
Well, we can't go back
outside with it.

652
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,436

Winner!

657
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:48,263
Where are we at?

658
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:50,759
- We're twice what we started.
- Jesus!

659
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,588
Why didn't we try craps
before crime?

660
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,260
I got to take this.

661
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:58,741
Hang on, what are we
supposed to do here?

662
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:00,353
Just be a loser.

663
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:06,449
Hey, I've called you
50 times.

664
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:07,681
Is everything okay?

665
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,380
- Danny's in the hospital.
- What?

666
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:12,934
Some kid checked him into
the board, he had the puck...

667
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,330
- Oh, my God.
- He even got the shot off.

668
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:16,462
What happened?

669
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:17,899
He got slammed
really hard, Beth.

670
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:20,120
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

671
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:23,705
The coach thinks it's
his wrist, probably broken.

672
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:25,689
Can you go be with him?

673
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:27,823
Coach had to go home.

674
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:30,049
Nurse says
he's sitting there alone.

675
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:32,302
Can you?

676
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,215
Not unless I want
to get arrested.

677
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:39,228
Hello?

678
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,854
Yeah, it's gonna be a while.

679
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,447
Why?

680
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:47,302
Because I...

681
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:50,890
'Cause I'm not very close.

682
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:52,681
Well, where the hell are you?

683
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:57,814
I'm... sort of
out of the country.

684
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,822
Of course you are.

685
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,041
Next time,

686
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,666
just lie to me.

687
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,762
Wait.

688
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:28,197
Can't we just keep it?
I mean...

689
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,809
- We need to sign for it.
- So?

690
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:32,334
You want your name
on record here

691
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,494
if they find all our Queens?

692
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:36,580
Put it all on two.

693
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:41,738
You sure you don't want
to spread it around?

694
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,142
Two.

695
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,846
No more bets.

696
00:34:56,655 --> 00:35:00,140
Oh, thank God.

697
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:03,002
Yes!
Oh, my God.

698
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:04,431
Whew.

699
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,825
- Chips fall where they may.
- Yeah, right.

700
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,944
To the unluckiest number.

701
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:11,658
2/2/2002.

702
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,080
Oh, honey.

703
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:16,947
Let's go home.

704
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,642
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

705
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:25,072
- You were there.
- Oh, the dot-com crash?

706
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,189
Her wedding.

707
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,822
Right, yes.
I knew that.

708
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,092
I'm gonna go
to the grocery store

709
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:53,931
and make him French toast
in the morning.

710
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:58,611
He didn't even ask for you.

711
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:19,455
Don't worry.
I paid for it.

712
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:21,442
Smells amazing.

713
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,634
It should
for how much it costs.

714
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:27,432
Is this
an Olive Garden special?

715
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:30,220
Yes, complete with
unlimited breadsticks.

716
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,049
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.

717
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,739
Uh, so,

718
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,595
um,

719
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:42,728
last night, uh...

720
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:47,439
I made things weird,
didn't I?

721
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:49,398
- No, no, no.
Seriously, not at all.

722
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:51,861
It's... it's fine.

723
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:54,851
It'll never happen again.
Cross my heart, hope to...

724
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:57,314
- Please.
Let's not go that far.

725
00:36:58,129 --> 00:36:59,572
Sweet.

726
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,861
- Right?
- Can I have cheese?

727
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:05,728
- Absolutely, Benjamin.
- Mmm, so good.

728
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:07,898
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

729
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:11,256
- Where's yours?
- Oh, I'm eating out tonight.

730
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:12,892
Why?

731
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:16,635
That's for me.

732
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:20,548
- Hello.
- Hey.

733
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:23,267
- Hey.
You look great.

734
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,416
Thanks.
I love you in that shirt.

735
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:27,718
I don't think you've ever
seen me in another one.

736
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:32,048
You remember Angela.

737
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,704
- Hi. Yes, of course.
- Hey.

738
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:38,080
Just having some dinner
with my son.

739
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,330
You guys should go have
some fun.

740
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:42,723
Not too much fun.

741
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:45,510
But, you know, just kidding.
I'm kidding.

742
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,549
Better hurry up.
It's trash night.

743
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:51,635
Bon appétit.

744
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,713
You should put cheese on it.

745
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:01,823
You're looping it
the wrong way.

746
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,846
I got these sausage fingers.
Look.

747
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:06,549
Okay, but you're just making
a knot now. That's not...

748
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,760
- Friendship knot.
- That's not a thing.

749
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:10,458
- That's totally a thing.
It's better.

750
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:12,755
You can't undo it.

751
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:14,369
- Uh-huh. Okay.
- It's tight.

752
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,648
- Make me one?
- Yeah, sure.

753
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,174
In your room.

754
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:22,158
All right.

755
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,291
How'd it go?

756
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,306
Why are you helping us?

757
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:37,306
What do you mean?

758
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:39,869
Why'd you let us print
at the club?

759
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,806
You needed a space.

760
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:45,127
Why'd you make Krystal
do the drop?

761
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,431
Didn't want you to drown
on a jet ski.

762
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,174
Remember our wedding?

763
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:55,119
Um, well, not much.

764
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:57,166
Before my mom
made you do shots.

765
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,095
What, like, the ceremony?

766
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:00,932
The part where we promised
to treat

767
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:02,767
each other's family
like our own.

768
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:04,246
Yeah, why do you think
I did the shots?

769
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,799
I'm not talking about my mom.

770
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:13,760
What'd you say to her, Stanley?

771
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,244
Oh.

772
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:27,088
We made a deal.

773
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,728
Well, we kinda made a deal.

774
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:35,446
I told her that I'd give you
guys the place...

775
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,588
Lady Luck ain't on your side
tonight, huh?

776
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,041
There was a problem.

777
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,994
- Always is.
- And I had to get rid of it.

778
00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:23,345
Never a solution.

779
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:26,072
Well, I didn't have
a lot of options.

780
00:40:26,611 --> 00:40:28,150
Oh, yeah?

781
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:32,822
Or did the dice
just not roll your way?

782
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,080
- We were being followed.
- Yeah, by my people.

783
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,861
Well, that would have been
really nice to know.

784
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:45,306
They don't like
to make a scene.

785
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,111
But I don't mind so much.

786
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,056
Well, someone else will.

787
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,330
Hmm.

788
00:40:58,604 --> 00:41:01,056
You got a guardian angel
I don't know about?

789
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:09,517
Maybe.

790
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:13,631
Everyone, meet Beth.

791
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,416
- Let's... yes.
- Hi.

792
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:16,831
Hi, Beth.

793
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,674
She's gonna be
running things around here.

794
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,112
- No, I'm helping.
- Just so we don't kill

795
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:22,791
whatever we plant.

796
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,650
Yeah.
They're all yours.

797
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:30,734
- Okay.
Well, I'm the new kid.

798
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,781
So maybe you guys
can help me out a little bit.

799
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,695
Show me what
you've already started.

800
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:37,994
Are you okay, man?

801
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,189
I'm fine.

802
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,955
You don't look so good.

803
00:41:45,264 --> 00:41:46,814
I just woke up.

804
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,361
About time.
