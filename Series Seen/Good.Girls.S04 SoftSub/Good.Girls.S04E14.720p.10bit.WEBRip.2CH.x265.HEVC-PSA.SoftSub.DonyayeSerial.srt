1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,918
Previously, on "Good Girls"...

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:07,137
Get me my funny money back.

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,530
How am I supposed to do that?

4
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,140
- Ask nicely.
- The cops?

5
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:11,489
Not them.

6
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:14,101
Nancy tried to grow
the business too fast.

7
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:15,841
- What's the damage?
- We're totaled.

8
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,278
You're homeless?

9
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,062
He's experiencing homelessness.

10
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,629
What happened with Angela?

11
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,196
She's not really
roommate material.

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,719
Why did you leave?

13
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,591
No one's ever really
needed me before.

14
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:29,551
I found this in my
underwear a while ago.

15
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,379
I got this from my wife's cell.

16
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:32,728
We're back in the club.

17
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,469
- Who's name is it in?
- All of us.

18
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:35,968
You can't give that
stuff to the DA.

19
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:37,472
Putting me in a tough spot.

20
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,015
If you can just drag
your feet a little bit...

21
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,668
It'd be a different story
if you were one of us.

22
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,540
- Can we help you?
- We're here about the dancing.

23
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,566
We're fully zoned and licensed.

24
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,742
There's enough there to
keep you from opening.

25
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:48,145
You want this
problem to go away?

26
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,528
- Yes, please.
- Then run for city council.

27
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,356
Miss us?

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,445
- So, what now?
- We get him.

29
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,360
You think a strip
club owner has a shot?

30
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:59,146
What changed your mind?

31
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,756
You.

32
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,977
Because crime isn't just
something that's downtown.

33
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,544
It's in our community.

34
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:09,547
And if we don't do something
about it right now,

35
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:13,812
the robberies, the drug
dealing, the gangs,

36
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,424
they're gonna show
up in our back yard,

37
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:20,123
or our front steps,
or even our kitchens.

38
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,300
And personally, I want
to live in a world

39
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,824
where I don't have to
lock my front door,

40
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,871
or watch my back every time
I go to the grocery store,

41
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,700
or worry that someone's
parked on my street,

42
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,136
waiting for me to leave,

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,227
so they can just come in
and take whatever they want.

44
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,709
I want to go back
to that Ashfield.

45
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,190
And I know you do too.

46
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,453
And that's why I'm
running for city council,

47
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:49,283
to proudly represent Ward 5.

48
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:56,942
How was it?

49
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:59,162
It was long.

50
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,164
Did you understand it?

51
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,645
Parts were funny.

52
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,387
You're really doing this, huh?

53
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,737
Was it that bad?

54
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:15,657
Uh, the principal
wants to see us again.

55
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,485
Didn't do it.

56
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,336
Okay, one more
time, from the top.

57
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:46,166
Street crime. You
got your petty theft,

58
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,907
drugs, carjacking,
what have you.

59
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,953
Now, this is where
you ladies come in.

60
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,738
Some of that money
gets washed right here.

61
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,263
The rest turns into counterfeit.

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,573
Then it goes across the
border and comes back clean.

63
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,140
But now they got to launder it,

64
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,187
or else the IRS starts
asking all these questions.

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,667
So, you have all your
little mom and pops,

66
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:13,758
electrical companies, plumbing,
materials, construction.

67
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,847
- Oh, I'm the banker.
- Oh.

68
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,109
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

69
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,242
Those same companies
pay for protection,

70
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,245
kickbacks to your boy.

71
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,421
- He is not our boy.
- Like, why does everyone...

72
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:27,685
- And in return, they get...
- Body glitter.

73
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,167
Contracts from a shell company,

74
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,735
owned by, guess who?

75
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,913
Gang friend's fairy godfather?

76
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,436
Is that what we're
gonna call him?

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,872
Works for me.

78
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,353
Now, this is where it
gets a little complicated.

79
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:44,876
Oh, jeez.

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,575
The shell companies are
hired by the city to build

81
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:50,839
whatever projects gang fairy
godfather can get approved.

82
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,537
Which is why he needs
you in that seat.

83
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,887
But we don't know what
his next project is.

84
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,541
Which is why we need
you in that seat.

85
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,543
To bring them all down.

86
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,504
Any questions?

87
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,073
Yeah.

88
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,554
How much of this do
we have to understand

89
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,731
to get our deal back?

90
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,298
None of it.

91
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,867
Good, 'cause you lost
me with that cutlet.

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,260
There's no deal.

93
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,306
He's here on vacation.

94
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,612
- So are you.
- Not really.

95
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,135
Well, I'm calling it a vacation.

96
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:29,530
Mm, I'm calling it suspended
for misplacing a suitcase

97
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:33,098
full of fake cash while
having drinks with a "friend."

98
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:37,625
So, just to be clear,
there's nothing in it for us.

99
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,584
How about not going
away for all of this?

100
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,761
Now, would that be
to a Canadian prison?

101
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,808
- Does that matter?
- I think I could handle it.

102
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,725
Can we keep our
cut from all this?

103
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,991
- Yeah.
- We all go home winners.

104
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,778
- What if I can't win?
- You're a natural.

105
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,172
Yeah, be she doesn't
know jack about politics.

106
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,870
She's great at pretending
to be something she's not.

107
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,612
Okay, look, there's
nothing to win.

108
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:11,180
You're just filling
an open seat.

109
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:14,009
- That was mine.

110
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,837
Just get the signatures.

111
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,363
- 97.98.99.100.

112
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,712
- Ahh!
- Whoo-hoo!

113
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,324
And I nominate my
buddy Bob Allen.

114
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,065
100 pushups, 100 seconds.

115
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,329
Why are you doing this?

116
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:30,634
He called me out on Insta.

117
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,462
Well, everyone at
the office did it.

118
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,421
- So what?
- So, if I flake,

119
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:37,424
I'd look like I don't
want to save teacup pigs.

120
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,906
- Do you believe this?
- I did it last week.

121
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
All right, show of hands,
who here even knows

122
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,521
what a teacup pig looks like?

123
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,482
A teacup pig?

124
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,354
- Thank you.
- Hey, what's up, boys?

125
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,181
Can I talk to you
guys for a sec?

126
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,400
Yeah.

127
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,359
- Don't worry.
- We won't nominate you.

128
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,795
No. Now you have to,

129
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,579
'cause I don't want
to be the only one.

130
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:08,193
Um, so, where are we at?

131
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,500
- With what?
- You know, my whole situation.

132
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,023
- Working on it.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:15,462
Okay, 'cause you... you
guys say that every time.

134
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,160
You can't just stick
it in Lady Justice.

135
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:20,031
Yeah, she's got to want it.

136
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,556
My wife is running
for city council.

137
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,863
What?

138
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,692
- Why?
- I don't know. Civic pride?

139
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,104
Well, that's just
what the city needs,

140
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,391
another woman on top.

141
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,393
I don't want her
to be humiliated.

142
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,872
Well, that's not on us.

143
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,546
In front of, you know,
like, the whole world.

144
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,572
- You backing out now?
- Hell no.

145
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,055
I don't know. Look, maybe...

146
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,710
You know, maybe-maybe
we just to a beat.

147
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,410
Hey, Darryl.

148
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,586
- This is Dean.
- Hey.

149
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,764
Who's that?

150
00:06:56,807 --> 00:07:00,985
Oh, you don't know your
friendly county DA?

151
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,726
He's one of us?

152
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,772
How do you think I
win all my cases?

153
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:07,427
Like we said, we're on it.

154
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,993
But we can do whatever you want.

155
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,908
Yeah, your call.

156
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,214
You good?

157
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,045
I just want it to be as quick
and painless as possible.

158
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,830
You got it, Dean.

159
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,877
But, uh, don't bring it
up here, though, okay?

160
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,661
- Sure.
- If this gets out,

161
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,142
be more than just our
bar cards on the line.

162
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,844
Mmm.

163
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,630
- Oh, hey, can you chop the...
- Already done.

164
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,372
Julienned. Nice.

165
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,939
Only took two
Band-Aids this time.

166
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:42,897
Aw, yeah.

167
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,289
- Eh?
- That looks great.

168
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,832
- Pretty good, right?
- Just in time, BM.

169
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:48,685
- Hi.
- Can that not be my nickname?

170
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,905
- It's your initials.
- Oh, speaking of... here.

171
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,515
Also something you flush.

172
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,952
Auntie Beth needs
you to sign this.

173
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,607
Uh, I'm not even
old enough to vote.

174
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,087
Okay, well get dad to do it.

175
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,524
- He's in Petoskey.
- Some corporate retreat.

176
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,874
- What about Nance?
- She's in bed.

177
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,615
- She sick or something?
- Depressed.

178
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:06,964
Why, 'cause she lost

179
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,793
her honorary parking
spot at Tiffany's?

180
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:13,580
More like her entire
purpose in life.

181
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,538
I'm gonna go change.

182
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:21,544
Ow.

183
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,765
- What's wrong?
-  Nothing.

184
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,593
- Is it your eyebrow zit?

185
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,377
You can see it?

186
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,814
Dude, it's like a third eye.

187
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,337
I've tried everything.

188
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,296
- Those are the worse.
- It won't go away.

189
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,689
Yeah, those kill.

190
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,908
It's, like, holding
my face hostage.

191
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,303
- Let me at it.
- Absolutely not.

192
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:44,088
- It'll feel so much better.
- No, that's disgusting.

193
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:46,569
Okay, here. Just trust me.

194
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,136
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

195
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,400
We just need to open up
the pores a little bit.

196
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,271
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

197
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:57,449
Hmm. Just like a spa.

198
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,364
Mm-hmm.

199
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:03,630
- Okay, can we stop?
- My eyeballs are hard-boiled.

200
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:05,849
This is ridiculous.

201
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,547
All right, how's it feel?

202
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,158
- Still bad.
- Okay.

203
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,551
- Don't do it.
- I'm going in.

204
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,702
You don't have to do this. No.

205
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,877
- I'm going in. Shh.
- No, no, no.

206
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,341
What if it squirts
into your eyeball?

207
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,532
Well, that will
certainly make our night

208
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,644
more interesting.

209
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:18,819
- Kevin.
- Annie.

210
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,212
Gentle. Gentle. Gentle.

211
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,518
- Oh!

212
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,389
Ow!

213
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:27,567
Eww.

214
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,438
How's it feel now?

215
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:32,484
It feels better, okay?

216
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:35,270
- Hungry?
- Not especially.

217
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:38,316
- Another beer?
- That, I would do.

218
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,404
All right.

219
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:52,330
Just sign at the bottom there.

220
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:55,682
- How many do you have?
- I'm getting there.

221
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,208
Do you want to hear where I
stand on the issues again?

222
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:05,300
Just really puts us
out there, you know?

223
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,259
You just have to hold
my purse a few times.

224
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:16,006
So

225
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,226
wouldn't have to dig too deep.

226
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,271
Your police records are sealed.

227
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,839
Well, that's not really
what I'm worried about.

228
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,277
Then what is it?

229
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,894
I just...

230
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:36,940
I don't want the whole thing
to blow up in your face.

231
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,641
Then wear long pants.

232
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,663
Who's "Bongo Man"?

233
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,577
Kevin's friend from the park.

234
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,492
That can't be his given name.

235
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,885
It's what he goes by.

236
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,192
Did you get his ID?

237
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,194
I saw the bongo.

238
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,241
Oh, excuse me, where'd you
guys get your signatures from?

239
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,634
- Church.
- School.

240
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,027
- Work.
- Kroger.

241
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,899
- We both hit the Kroger.
- Two different days.

242
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:25,510
Well, now we have all
the demos covered, okay?

243
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,256
So much for this being low key.

244
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,130
Maybe gang fairy
godfather tipped them off.

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,264
But I-I didn't, like,
put on makeup, and...

246
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,875
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You look hot.

247
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,615
I'm supposed to look like a mom.

248
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,269
- Hot mom.
- Denise!

249
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,620
We can't just give
this seat away,

250
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:52,494
especially to a woman who
doesn't share our values,

251
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:55,323
which is why I am also
running for city council,

252
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,629
to ensure that our
wonderful community

253
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,327
is represented by someone

254
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,242
who understand what
our children need.

255
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,461
How do you feel about
the proposed dress code

256
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,724
for public school?

257
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,204
Looks like you just
got out-mom'd, brah.

258
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:10,730
.

259
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,255
Do you know what it means
to be Ashfield proud?

260
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,823
Denise Carpenter does.

261
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:20,609
Enriching the lives
of those in need.

262
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:24,178
Helping to shape
the developing mind.

263
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:28,748
And comforting those
entering the autumn of life.

264
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,839
She believes the pulse of
our city comes from service,

265
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,885
faith, and family.

266
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:40,629
Because her heart's always
been in the same place...

267
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:43,110
With the people of Ashfield.

268
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:47,549
I'm Ashfield proud.

269
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,377
Paid for by Family
First Alliance.

270
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,775
Yeah, that sucks.

271
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:01,476
And why does everyone look so
much more important in slow-mo?

272
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:05,262
I know, even the flag
waving kind of got me

273
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,134
a little choked up, you know?

274
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:08,962
You said I was a shoo-in.

275
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,791
That was before
Jesus got involved.

276
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:17,622
Well, can you, like, grease
some palms or whatever?

277
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,102
To get you elected?

278
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:20,887
Isn't that what you guys do?

279
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,846
It's not really
how democracy works.

280
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,893
Okay, so all your
projects and whatever...

281
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,854
- What about them?
- They're all

282
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,813
aboveboard?

283
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,430
You know, this isn't
zoning and garden for kids

284
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,624
or building a parking structure.

285
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,302
So, how can I help
you with those things

286
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:46,738
if you can't help
me get elected?

287
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:47,914
Money.

288
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,829
And where is that pot of gold?

289
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:59,534
- Nowhere good.
- I'm used to it.

290
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,712
Donors, Elizabeth.

291
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,498
And how do we get to their gold?

292
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,066
Take them to your church.

293
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,338
How's your civic pride tonight?

294
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:24,776
- Solid.
- I'm gonna need to see it.

295
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,911
All donations, tax-deductible!

296
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,614
Keep the bottom
for your receipt.

297
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,444
- 20 bucks.
- What's it get me?

298
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,968
Safer streets.

299
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:44,903
And that's why I would expand

300
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,327
our neighborhood
watch crime groups.

301
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,800
Because the best eyes on the
street are your neighbors.

302
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,193
You can't always
trust the police,

303
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,282
so you gotta make sure
that your tax dollars

304
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,762
are going to the programs

305
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,983
that are gonna really help
protect your community.

306
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,072
So, can I count on your support?

307
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,552
Yeah, yeah, sure.

308
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,052
Come on, you can
do better than that

309
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,381
to support our girl.

310
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,695
Hello?

311
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,003
Anybody home?

312
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,617
I, uh, I used the key.

313
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,577
Let's see. Rise and shine.

314
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:30,016
- Hmm.

315
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,148
Oh, my God.

316
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,846
Leave me alone!

317
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,197
Do you know where your baby is?

318
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,765
With someone who showers.

319
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,942
Do you know what day it is?

320
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:47,337
Does it matter?

321
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,601
Yes. Because it is spa day.

322
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,995
Huh. Look at this.

323
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,215
Eyes.

324
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,347
Face.

325
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,088
Hair.

326
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,612
And even body.

327
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,139
Here. Let's... come here.

328
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,097
Give me a foot. Where's
that little foot?

329
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,292
- No.
- Where is that little foot?

330
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:10,752
Stop! What is wrong with you?

331
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,407
- What is wrong with you?
- I lost everything!

332
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,279
Ugh. Well, so get it back!

333
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:17,977
It's not like

334
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,892
it's not like Tupperware
that someone borrowed.

335
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,287
Look, you know, businesses fail.

336
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:25,985
It-it happens.

337
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,118
- You don't get it.

338
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,728
Why don't you try me?

339
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,131
I was super into this
senior in high school,

340
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:45,178
and he was super into
this "Mortal Kombat" game

341
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,440
at our 7-Eleven.

342
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,833
Every day before school,

343
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:52,576
I went and I practiced,
to impress him.

344
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,057
- Well, did it work?
- We went to prom.

345
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,538
- Hey y'all.
- Also, I had, like,

346
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,627
the highest score for,
like, seven years,

347
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,716
before some dick
unplugged the machine.

348
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,284
You know it was him.

349
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,115
I never fail.

350
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,257
- What about your marriage?
- Excuse me?

351
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,913
I mean, he did bone me.

352
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,307
- Okay.
- More than once.

353
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,614
- Are you-are you serious?
- While you were pregnant.

354
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:33,835
- It was a rough patch.
- I don't know.

355
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,056
Sounds like a pretty
big fail, if you ask me.

356
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,972
Got him back, didn't I?

357
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,759
Exactly.

358
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,983
God.

359
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:53,724
You didn't have
any better example

360
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,813
for your teachable moment?

361
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:03,952
Look, you just... you just
hit another rough patch.

362
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,738
It's so embarrassing.

363
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,786
Hey.

364
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,964
It's gonna be okay.

365
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:22,362
I'm gonna leave you
to your pity party.

366
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:26,801
Just remember, massager,
not just for your foot.

367
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,763
I can't pay you back
for any of this.

368
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,984
It's cool. I used CVS points.

369
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,391
Cute.

370
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,262
20 bucks.

371
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,785
Yeah, no, I'm good.

372
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:56,831
How about a bumper sticker?

373
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,660
I'll just take my dry cleaning.

374
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,141
It's all boxed up.

375
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,277
Hey, let me ask you something.

376
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:12,020
- What's in it for you?
- What do you mean?

377
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,153
I mean, why do you
want to run this town?

378
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,372
Nick said I would good at it.

379
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,418
Oh. Nick, huh?

380
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,899
- Yeah, your genetic relation.
- Whatever you call him.

381
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,292
Pretty smart guy.

382
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,165
Yeah, he seems to
know how it all works.

383
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:31,257
So, you just do
whatever Nick says, huh?

384
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,044
Don't you?

385
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,744
That's what you think?

386
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,099
I just know he's in city hall
and you're in a strip club.

387
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:52,060
Mm-hmm.

388
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,238
That's some bag you got.

389
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,719
Yeah, he's a pretty smart guy.

390
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,722
Oh, no doubt.

391
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,118
Box that up for me too.

392
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,734
- This isn't yours.
- It's my strip club.

393
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,344
- This is campaign money.
- No.

394
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,217
You didn't get this far
by taking handouts, right?

395
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,787
- I need this to run.
- Oh, yeah?

396
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,833
Let's see.

397
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:31,012
You can't.

398
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,754
Take it up with city hall.

399
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:43,807
.

400
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:58,257
- That make you feel good?
- Yo, get him a Scotch.

401
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,302
- Really showed me, huh?
- Top shelf.

402
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,522
- Any shelf is fine.
- Oh.

403
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:06,134
Look who's trying
to keep it real now.

404
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,005
Make it off the top.

405
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,594
I don't think you get what
we're trying to do here.

406
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,447
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ain't no we.

407
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,579
What you're trying to do.

408
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:18,543
There'd be no shelf if
it wasn't for what I do.

409
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:21,410
- Fine, drink the cheap stuff.
- No shelves at all.

410
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,109
And you'd be on a city
salary if it wasn't for me.

411
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:28,199
Don't forget that.

412
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:30,463
You think you'd
have any of this?

413
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,295
You think you'd have her?

414
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,431
- Just know one thing.
- What?

415
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:46,217
- It isn't about her.
- What's it about?

416
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,308
It won't be me doing the time.

417
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,355
'Cause you'd make
sure it was me.

418
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,757
Nah, I got this.

419
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,370
- No, no, no.
- You better keep what you can.

420
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,686
Can't we just get those
donor guys back to the club?

421
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:22,993
- And tell them what?
- "Oopsie, we lost it all"?

422
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,954
Okay. What about a car wash?

423
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:29,086
Do you have any
idea how much, like,

424
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,697
a minute of airtime costs?

425
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,612
Paid for that sick-ass trip

426
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,222
in high school we
took to Toronto.

427
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,355
Thought you hated Canada.

428
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,966
- Except Toronto.
- Seriously?

429
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,881
It's the best science
center in the world.

430
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,666
Hmm. You'd have to wash
every car in the city.

431
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,016
Can we just skip the
part where we pretend

432
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,889
like there's any
legitimate way to do this?

433
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,327
- Fine.
- But we gotta change it up.

434
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,850
- New masks?
- Like Halloween?

435
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,548
Or like those motorcycle helmets

436
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,332
with the mirrored visors.

437
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,682
You can't hear a thing in those.

438
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,684
Sorry, where are you
buying a Halloween mask

439
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:04,339
- this time of year?
- Uh, Amazon.

440
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,820
We can't rob.

441
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,738
- We've never carjacked.
- Still need a mask for that.

442
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:15,916
You guys. My entire
platform is anti-crime.

443
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:22,575
- So?
- So, we can't do crime.

444
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:27,144
No, we just can't do
crime and then get caught.

445
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,756
Hmm. It's the end of an era.

446
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,714
Hey, Principal Clark's waiting.

447
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,890
- You got to hustle.
- Aren't you coming?

448
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,110
Unless he wants to meet
on the corner of Delaney

449
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:37,981
and 3rd, it is all you.

450
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,071
You're right. Sorry.

451
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,986
What did he do this time?

452
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,250
Your son's very popular
with all the students.

453
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:48,731
That's good.

454
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:52,213
- They think he's hilarious.
- He is.

455
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:54,476
And also very creative.

456
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,392
Okay, what am I doing here?

457
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,089
I'm in the lounge the other day,

458
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,831
when I hear... honking.

459
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,312
Okay?

460
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,402
All day. It-it doesn't end.

461
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,753
- Right.
- So, eventually, I got up,

462
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,407
went outside to see
what was going on,

463
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,889
and Kenny had written on
the side of the building.

464
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,979
And what did it say?

465
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,503
"Honk if you hate
Principal Clark."

466
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,896
Oh.

467
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,680
Apparently, everyone
in town hates me,

468
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,073
because it went to the point

469
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,162
that teachers could
barely conduct lessons.

470
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,687
And how do you know
that it was Kenny?

471
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,822
I had hair before
I met your son.

472
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,482
Also, these were in his locker.

473
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,487
How's it going at
home, Mrs. Boland?

474
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:52,969
I mean, you know, just
like every other family.

475
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,363
- How's his binge eating?

476
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:57,844
- Much better.
- Well,

477
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,691
I'm afraid to say he's still
having a hard time here.

478
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,848
I mean, the kid constantly
needs attention,

479
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,024
and he certainly
knows how to get it.

480
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,769
We encourage our students
to get their message across,

481
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,727
just not at the
school's expense.

482
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,644
Won't happen again.

483
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:21,128
My opponent can blanket the
airwaves with her message.

484
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,565
But I'd rather be out
here doing something.

485
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,002
And what's your
message, Mrs. Boland?

486
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,396
It's time to clean
up our streets.

487
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,621
My removing their calling cards,

488
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,666
we're saying to these gangs,

489
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,668
you are not welcome in Ashfield.

490
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,374
And whether I'm elected or not,

491
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,898
I will continue to fight

492
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,552
for the safety of
this community.

493
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,988
And how do you plan to do that?

494
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,990
Well, as a mother, I know

495
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,948
that some of the best
ways to clean up a mess

496
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,428
are to get to it
before it starts.

497
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,734
What are you doing? Uh-uh.

498
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:04,084
No. You gotta go big.

499
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,436
When you walk by a business
that's vandalized like this,

500
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,046
and you just assume
that it's normal,

501
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,701
you know what happens?
It becomes normal.

502
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,703
How'd I do? And a
building like this

503
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:16,792
- with these tags says...
- Can I have my iPad?

504
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,577
You're still grounded.

505
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,274
Wait, who's that guy?

506
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,102
Who?

507
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:27,237
- That-that guy. The guy.
- The guy with the coffees.

508
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,285
Uh, he's just some
guy who works there.

509
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,895
Are you sure?

510
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,811
I mean, he made me a latte.

511
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,900
Why, do you know him?

512
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,772
- I thought I did, yeah.

513
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,252
Hey, Mom, your friend's here.

514
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:45,865
Hi, Denise.

515
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,044
Does your family have a
special tie to the islands?

516
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,699
There's so much Caribbean flair.

517
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,702
Uh, Kenny, get the
girls ready for dance.

518
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:01,184
- Is that a hot tub?
- Yeah.

519
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:03,709
We like to treat every
day like it's a vacation.

520
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,121
Well, how do you
have time to relax

521
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:07,364
with all the campaigning
that you're doing?

522
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,062
How can I help you, Denise?

523
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,455
I came to congratulate you.

524
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,807
- I haven't won yet.
- Chief Gorski has been raving

525
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,766
about your neighborhood
safety plan.

526
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,681
Oh, well he's been
really helpful.

527
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,292
And I would love for
you to get it going.

528
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,338
That's the plan.

529
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:27,471
- After I'm elected.
- I don't understand.

530
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,387
I'm offering you a job.

531
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,259
Why would I do that?

532
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,653
Because he also mentioned
the legal trouble

533
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,350
that your husband's been having.

534
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,527
He hasn't been
convicted of anything.

535
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,833
But does it really matter,

536
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,313
when that's your
entire platform?

537
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,928
- Can we order a pizza?
- Uh, one-one minute.

538
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,236
- Anyway, you're busy.
- Think about it.

539
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,022
Oh.

540
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,242
Mahalo.

541
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:07,337
.

542
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,513
- Oh.

543
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,820
Do Not Disturb is on.

544
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,696
You're disturbing!

545
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:21,700
Oh, my God.

546
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,880
What do you want?

547
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,448
A do-over.

548
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,408
I'm good.

549
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:36,976
There's nothing to steal
from you this time.

550
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,720
One drink.

551
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,855
I need that plate back.

552
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,599
What for?

553
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:54,036
So I can replace
what I took from you.

554
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,604
- What good would that do?
- You could say

555
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,389
that you misplaced it and
make everything right again.

556
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,696
- Too late.
- Wouldn't make us right.

557
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,047
- He made me do it, okay?
- You should have told me.

558
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:08,659
- I had to protect my family.
- Maybe I could have helped.

559
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:11,358
I'm supposed to trust
the person who busted me?

560
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,402
- Yeah.
- How?

561
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:14,665
I trusted you.

562
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,625
Because we're supposed
to be friends?

563
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,255
- I don't know.
- How would that even work?

564
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,628
I don't know.

565
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,630
Okay, so we just put
aside that I do what I do

566
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:25,415
and that you do what you
do, and we just meet up

567
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,288
for a girls' trip
in Cabo every year?

568
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:45,435
The plate's back in D.C.

569
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:49,526
- Can you get it?
- I just want to get him.

570
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,618
- I can't run.
- Why?

571
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:57,839
Because she's gonna
use Dean against me.

572
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,145
Who leaked it?

573
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:01,277
Her daughter takes tap
with the chief's kid.

574
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,931
It's a mom thing.

575
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,066
Look, I have to
bring back something.

576
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,545
I have to drop out.

577
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,417
And I'd rather it not be you.

578
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,636
So, what am I
supposed to do here?

579
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,683
Do to her what you did to me.

580
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,344
What they call a gym
is actually a closet

581
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,955
with a NordicTrack from 1992.

582
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:30,393
I'd be better off up here
curling bags of my own urine.

583
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,439
Please don't.

584
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,574
Everything cool?

585
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:43,754
Yep.

586
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,849
I'm gonna take a shower.

587
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,855
- That I say that, obviously.

588
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,789
How come everything makes
me think of Harry Styles?

589
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,293
- I mean...

590
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,080
I thought he broke up with her.

591
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,822
Could be a rebound.

592
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:12,087
Do you want me to,
uh, turn the oven on?

593
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,875
What's wrong?

594
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:21,270
Oh, nothing, they just
forgot the garlic knots.

595
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,925
Mm-hmm. I'll warm it up.

596
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,371
There's pizza, if you
want to come up for air.

597
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,634
Cool. Come check us out.

598
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:40,072
That will not be
necessary, thank you.

599
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:42,074
Come here!

600
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,734
She needed someone
to do the back.

601
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,302
- You could have called.

602
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,957
They shut my phone off.

603
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,785
You can't pay your phone bill?

604
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,961
Auto-pay is connected
to an overdrawn account.

605
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,094
It's like a whole thing.

606
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,769
Well, I really hope you
know what you're doing.

607
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,882
He trained at Vidal Sassoon.

608
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,842
- Oh no, Vito Sassin.
- Who's that?

609
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:14,106
Owns the dog-grooming
place on Trumble.

610
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,585
Oh, my God.

611
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:17,085
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna take over.

612
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,937
Why don't you grab a slice, huh?

613
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,854
- All right.
- Thank you.

614
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,030
Okay.

615
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:28,555
How is it?

616
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:30,470
Let me see.

617
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:31,993
Hmm.

618
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,777
Oh, no.

619
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:36,563
Can't believe I'm saying this,

620
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:39,609
but he actually
got all your roots.

621
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,394
- Really?
- Yeah.

622
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:44,614
And I feel like he somehow
may have given you highlights?

623
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,573
Oh. Okay.

624
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,444
Maybe I should
start going to Vito.

625
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:54,276
Wow. This is, like,
kind of amazing.

626
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:57,192
- Well, so is he.

627
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:59,368
You know, he taught me
how to get double points.

628
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:03,372
And not just at CVS, but, like,
Walgreens, Rite Aid, Krogers.

629
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,983
They all apparently do it.

630
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,115
- Yeah.
- His whole life is a hack.

631
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,292
I shouldn't have been
so judgey about him.

632
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:12,077
It's hard not to be.

633
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,210
- He's a really good guy.
- Yeah.

634
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:16,971
You know, there aren't
a lot of them out there.

635
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,520
- Ugh, I know.
- I'm really happy for you.

636
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:27,483
Oh. Uh, no, we're not...
it's not like-like that.

637
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,007
Oh.

638
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,711
Why not?

639
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:42,585
- It's so clean.
- Oh, well, my kids know

640
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:45,153
it's the only way to
get their allowance.

641
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,913
I can hardly get mine
to brush their teeth.

642
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:48,156
Oh, well, you know,

643
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,811
you just... you have
to give them structure.

644
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:53,031
Or maybe you're very
good at convincing people

645
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,250
to do things they
don't want to do.

646
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,991
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

647
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,558
If it makes you feel any better,

648
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,101
I think that we're
gonna be a great team.

649
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,040
- Oh, so do I.
- Wonderful.

650
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,651
I couldn't win without you.

651
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:07,088
Wait, I'm sorry?

652
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,788
I'm gonna need all
those Jesus lovers.

653
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:18,056
Is that a Portmeirion
butter dish?

654
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,884
- Yeah.
- It was an anniversary gift.

655
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,625
Do you have the whole set?

656
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,760
He can have it.

657
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:28,979
Do you collect Portmeirion?

658
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,155
Nah.

659
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,685
What is he doing?

660
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,037
He is making it look
like a home invasion.

661
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,735
Wait, no, I-I-I have a family.

662
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,825
So do I.

663
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,001
Wait, please-please
don't do this.

664
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:52,481
Can we hurry this up?

665
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,788
I've got to pick
up Danny from band.

666
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:02,230
I'll do whatever you want.

667
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,102
I'll leave him out of it.

668
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:09,759
Does your daughter skate too?

669
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,413
Hey, do you like figure skating?

670
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:13,502
I love the Ice Capades.

671
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:18,812
He will be at every practice,
every show, everywhere.

672
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:24,122
- I won't-I won't tell anyone.

673
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:31,216
Oh, hey, thank you
for your support.

674
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:39,833
.

675
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:42,009
- Come over here.
- I got it.

676
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:44,229
- No, I need you to see.
- Come here.

677
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:51,149
- Yeah.
- What is that?

678
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,846
It's not the end of the world.

679
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,240
A Big Mac is people food.

680
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:56,763
I'm sorry, okay?

681
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,678
- Well, how does that help me?
- I...

682
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,769
What do you want, Tina?

683
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,486
I want you to wake up in
the middle of the night

684
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,903
when Licorice has his
squirts all over our bedroom.

685
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:10,211
- Fine.
- Hey, we're not done here.

686
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,300
He barely ate of it.

687
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:13,997
I just need you to
answer something.

688
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,088
What's that?

689
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:21,222
How do you make it through
your day being such a moron?

690
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,616
Can we talk about this later?

691
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:25,922
Just think about my question.

692
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,405
Hey, where were we? Um...

693
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,494
Oh, right, so corporate
wants us to do a promo

694
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,844
with the fruit acid peel.

695
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:38,587
Can I ask you something?

696
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,502
Oh, she's on an elephant dose

697
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,982
of IVF crap. Ignore her.

698
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:45,203
Hey, did you really give
that stuff to the DA?

699
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,206
Yeah. Why?

700
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,383
- Saw him yesterday.
- Where?

701
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,214
- Starbucks.
- Nice.

702
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,218
He works there.

703
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,438
Well, he works out
of a lot of places.

704
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:07,573
Mm, no, he was
serving the coffee.

705
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:11,707
- Middle-aged balanced dad?
- Yeah, with a green apron.

706
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,753
That could have been anybody.

707
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:17,409
But the name tag said "Darryl."

708
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,545
We didn't have a choice.

709
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,551
I made the name tag part up.

710
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,251
We're gonna send
it to the real DA.

711
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,688
What are you guys waiting for?

712
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:39,692
- Ask your friend.
- Stan?

713
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:43,043
Hey, you're not the only
one in a tight spot.

714
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,439
Jesus, it's all
over the comforter!

715
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:53,314
- Coming!
- Bring the carpet cleaner!

716
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:54,968
Excuse me.

717
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,413
You in my business again?

718
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,763
- What the hell is bee venom?
- Oh.

719
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,852
Don't tell me. I know this one.

720
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:12,333
Increases blood
flow to the area,

721
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,117
bringing fresh
oxygen and nutrients.

722
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:18,208
Also stimulates the production
of collagen and elastin.

723
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:21,429
Hmm. Yeah, I meant all
of this. What is this?

724
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,910
Well, it's my
business, literally.

725
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:26,782
- Bee venom?
- No, not just that.

726
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:30,090
There's a... got
a Vitamin C balm,

727
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,353
got your Energizing Face Wash,

728
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:35,313
and you got your
Serum Concentrate.

729
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,360
So, lotions.

730
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,450
Look, babe, I'm
just-I'm just trying

731
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:43,799
to keep us out of trouble, okay?

732
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:47,412
- But I have the club now.
- Club's trouble.

733
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:49,544
The club pays the bills.

734
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,546
Till more trouble
comes knocking.

735
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:56,508
- Who is this trouble?
- I don't know.

736
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,728
But it just always kind of
seems to find you ladies.

737
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,778
Is this, like, the Scouts,

738
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,780
where I gotta make
people buy it at work?

739
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:10,739
- No. No, no, no.
- I hit up my own network.

740
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:16,266
- How deep are you in this?
- What, just a year's worth.

741
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,313
- Jesus.
- What?

742
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,448
Just so you know, none of
these are for Black people.

743
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,669
These are all for Black people.

744
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:32,761
That's not for Black people.

745
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,391
- How'd we get our stuff back?
- I don't know.

746
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,524
Maybe we got our fish back too.

747
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,554
You got another zit?

748
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,470
Nope.

749
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,765
It's not a knock,
but it's a start.

750
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,686
I love what you've
done with the place.

751
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,516
Why'd you give it all back?

752
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,476
Not all of it.

753
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,826
Why any of it?

754
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,961
Saw you're tagging's
really coming along.

755
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,964
I've got a really
good campaign team.

756
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,534
I told you you didn't need him.

757
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:40,889
I will take one of
those T-shirts, though.
