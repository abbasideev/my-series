00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,692
Hi. Excuse me.
- We're moving double what we

524
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,860
did six months ago,
and we're good.

525
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,495
- I'm tired
of dealing with him.

526
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,563
I don't wanna deal
with him anymore.

527
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,664
No, no, no,
Hey, guys.

528
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,765
- I just need to
know we're good.

529
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,500
- If not, we renegotiate, okay?

530
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,501
Start at 40 crates,
go up only as needed.

531
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,802
- 40?
- Yeah.

532
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,003
- I need you to make
a tally every 100,000.

533
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,004
- No one's gonna show
up at my house,

534
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,840
no guys,
no guns?

535
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,508
- I can find ten different guys
to do what they do.

536
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,776
- I'll get on top of that.
- All right.

537
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,977
No, guys, in the back,
let's keep it going.

538
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,846
Let's keep it going.
Yep, yep, yep.

539
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,913
- I want you to keep a tally
every 100,000, understood?

540
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,649
- It's all good.

541
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:03,916
Just make sure you keep
an eye on your stacks.

542
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,652
It's all gotta be
tight, tight, tight.

543
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,787
I want 100s here, 50s here.
Okay, separate them.

544
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,456
I don't want what happened
last time, okay?

545
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,023
- No, I'm gonna need
to hear you say it.

546
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,568
- We're good.

547
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,572
- [clears throat]

548
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,941
- Can I get you anything else?
- Oh, yeah.

549
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,610
We're gonna take another round

550
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,011
of these pineapple margaritas,
please?

551
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,714
Extra strong this time.
And then we also want one

552
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,048
of those fried onion things
that has, like,

553
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,950
the arms that stick out.
You know those?

554
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,586
- Nachos!
- Yes.

555
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,789
- Nachos, and, um, uh, the, uh,
poppers.

556
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,691
Uh, jalapeño poppers.
- Two orders of those, please.

557
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,958
She's a lightweight.

558
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:47,627
- Are we celebrating today,
ladies?

559
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,696
- Oh, I would certainly say so.
Yeah.

560
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,631
- Uh, yeah.
- What's the special occasion?

561
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,833
- Oh, we just smuggled a bunch
of counterfeit money

562
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,669
over the Canadian border and
escaped a violent street gang.

563
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,972
- And no drugs in our butts.
- No drugs in our butts!

564
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,541
- Yay!

565
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:02,975
- Yay for no drugs
in our butts.

566
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,577
[laughter]

567
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,846
- So, pretty special, huh?

568
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,848
- I'll put that right in.
- Thank you.

569
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,250
- Oh, she hates us.
- No, I think she loves us.

570
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,251
- Oh, my God.
How much money

571
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,753
do you think that was?

572
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,722
- It was one bajillion dollars,
actually.

573
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,558
- I've never seen that much
cash in my life.

574
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,927
- I mean, fake money.
But yeah.

575
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,762
- Well, I mean,
it's real to somebody.

576
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,665
- Yeah, but it's no longer
our problem.

577
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,635
- Whoo!
- So here's to going back

578
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,269
to normal life.
- Yes.

579
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,004
L'chaim to that.

580
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,674
- Yeah, to normal life.

581
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,543
[clinking]

582
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:39,646
[slurping]

583
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,050
- You okay?

584
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,620
- [slurping]

585
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,821
Yeah.

586
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,860
I think I'm gonna, um,
call the kids, though.

587
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,662
- Oh, boy, that reminds me.

588
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,531
I--We should probably get the
check with the food

589
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,032
just 'cause, like, you know,
to be safe.

590
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,802
- Oh, we have time.
You'll get home.

591
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,136
- I know, it's just...

592
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,706
I, like, really need this
to go well.

593
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,108
You know, like,
it has to.

594
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,911
- It's gonna go great.
You are a good mom.

595
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,680
Just chill.

596
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,583
- Yeah, you're right.
Thanks.

597
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,753
- I shot a man.

598
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,889
- How are the kids?
- Good, great.

599
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:24,657
when--When are you coming
back?

600
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,326
I got a little bit
of a situation here.

601
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,928
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Well, um,

602
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,563
It's, uh,
it's the craziest thing.

603
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,565
We got hit.

604
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,000
I mean,
I don't know how many cars,

605
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,168
but we have a lot of police
officers everywhere.

606
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,638
[upbeat music]

607
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:39,906
- We'll come right now.

608
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:44,811
*

609
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:46,078
You guys,
they know about the car.

610
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:49,081
*

611
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,683
- Check, please!

612
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:51,718
- We'll dump it
on the side of the road.

613
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,085
Let the cops do their job.

614
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,186
- Yeah, I mean, they already
know it's stolen.

615
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,022
- No one suspects a thing.

616
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,924
- Oh, hey, there's that empty
parking lot off I-94.

617
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,358
You know,
by the Chrysler plant?

618
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,694
- Yep, that's perfect.
[engine starts]

619
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,362
[beeping]

620
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,965
- Hold up.
You synched your phone?

621
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,667
- So?
I mean,

622
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,068
I wanted my music
for the road trip.

623
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:12,705
- So it has your name
and all of your contacts

624
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,674
in a car that was
reported stolen.

625
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:17,209
- Okay, so we just unsynch it.
- How do I do that?

626
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,078
- You can't.
- Oh, of course you can.

627
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,713
Just--
- No, Dean borrowed my minivan,

628
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,014
like, once,
and it still asks me

629
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:23,683
if I wanna connect
to his pocket rocket.

630
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,984
[beeps]
- Look, there.

631
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:25,985
It's wiped.
Go ahead.

632
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,820
Restart the car.
Go ahead.

633
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:31,691
[engine stops and restarts]

634
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,760
[beeping]

635
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,062
- Hmm.
- Yeah, hmm.

636
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,964
[beeping]

637
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,398
- Okay, you know, I'm thinking
we may just have to reboot

638
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,100
the whole thing.
- What are you--

639
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,802
What are you talking about?
- The actual hard drive

640
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,737
of the actual car.
- What?

641
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,706
- What are you even
talking about?

642
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,007
- I don't know, I'm just saying
words that I've heard before.

643
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,911
- What now?
- Well, we have to torch it.

644
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,946
- You wanna blow up a car?
- We're not doing that.

645
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,716
- Beth, it has my digital
fingerprints on it!

646
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,150
- In the middle
of rush hour traffic,

647
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:01,721
you wanna blow up a car.
- Do you have a better idea?

648
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,856
[quirky music]

649
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,027
You know, I just--
- Nope.

650
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,899
- I just wanna--
- Nuh-uh.

651
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,971
[splashing]

652
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,973
[melancholy music]

653
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:27,880
[cell phone rings]

654
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,221
- Hello?

655
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:39,726
- Hello?
Hello?

656
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,696
Hello, did I lose you?
Hello?

657
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,131
- Hello?

658
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,033
- Hi, it's Clare Davis.

659
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,201
I'm here for your custody
evaluation.

660
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,203
- Jesus, my God!
Oh, my God!

661
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,939
Okay.
- It's almost 7:00.

662
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,774
- Hi, hi, I'm so sorry.

663
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,142
I'm just running
a little bit late.

664
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,946
I'm having a little bit of...
Car trouble.

665
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,213
- Well, how far away are you?

666
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,782
- Not far!

667
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:15,828
.

668
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:16,395
- This is us at Six Flags.

669
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,732
My mom looks kind of weird
because she just barfed.

670
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,300
- [laughs]

671
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,804
- Yeah, I, uh, I always do
after Big Blue, right?

672
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,472
- [laughs]
She still goes on it

673
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,507
with me anyway.
- Uh, hi.

674
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,910
I'm Annie.
I'm so, so, so sorry

675
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:36,182
I, uh, am so late.
My day just got crazy.

676
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,449
- Oh, how so?

677
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,451
- She does a lot
of charity work.

678
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,988
- With kids.
Yeah, I love kids.

679
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,356
You know, sick kids.
And healthy kids.

680
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,925
I mean, who doesn't love
healthy kids?

681
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,795
Wow, I can't stop
saying "kids."

682
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,196
- What kind of children
do you work with?

683
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,798
- Mentally disabled.
- Cancer...

684
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,800
Kind.

685
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,904
Cancer and they are also
mentally disabled, yeah.

686
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,807
So it's really sad.

687
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,443
- Wow, yeah, uh,
well, you must be exhausted.

688
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,478
Um, I'll make this quick.

689
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,816
I just have a few standard
questions.

690
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:10,983
- Shrimp?

691
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,256
- [sighs]

692
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,829
Kids just went down.

- Can we please
do this tomorrow?

695
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,769
- Nope.

696
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,942

I overreacted.

697

She can come over for dinner.
Once, okay?

698
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,512
- Nope.

699
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,515
- What more do you
want from me?

700
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,455
- Your hands where
I can see them.

701
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,058
- [chuckles]
Seriously?

702
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,826
- Oh, yeah.

703

- Babe, I'm legit so tired.

704
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,499
- Yeah, but you just came back
from a girls' trip.

705

- Trust me,
it was not relaxing.

706

to take a quick peek

- It's fine.

bleeding like this?

724
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,115
- Since I made the shrimp.

725

- Okay, how long did you
leave her alone today?

726

- We don't have any.
I already looked.

situation,

I'm gonna have to report it.

- Sadie.

Normally, I don't.
But today I had to.

733

I had something really
important come up,

734
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,539
and I--I just lost track
of the time.

735
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:17,509
- Because of the mentally
disabled cancer kids?

736
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,445
- Sadie, I have to take you
to a hospital.

737
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,013
I... I think you need stitches.

738

at the moment.

Still doing intake.

I have to pay for.

I wouldn't.

that's craziness.

not to leave me.

that you are the
love of my life.

kind of cheesy,

00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,734
- Hello, everyone.

870
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:53,572
Um, I would just like to follow
up on the other day.

871
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,342
To be totally honest,
I am not feeling

872
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,477
super good about it.

873
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,914
Sheila, you went above and
beyond for our little girl.

874
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,484
I don't even know how you put
together all that money.

875
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,686
You're still at the salon,
right?

876
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,557
- I've saved here and there
over the years.

877
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,893
- Well, listen.

878
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:19,498
I realize that I reacted badly.

879
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,602
Because I have a hard time
taking charity.

880
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,637
Pride is a sin,
as we all know.

881
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:26,838
all: Amen.

882
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,674
- So I would just like
to say something

883
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,376
that I should have said before.

884
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,511
Which is thank you.

885
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,514
[applause]
Thank you for the money.

886
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:36,948
- You're welcome.

887
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,421
- And thank you for offering
to drive the kids

888
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,855
home from school
when I'm at work.

889
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,857
And thanks for offering

890
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,794
to babysit so that we
can have a date night.

891
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:53,532
And offering to do the laundry
and, oh, my God, the groceries.

892
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,501
At Whole Foods, no less.
- Seriously?

893
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,770
- Because this woman--
This woman only buys

894
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,473
organic, people.
[applause]

895
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,808
- I don't even know
what to say.

896
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,411
- There's nothing to say.

897
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,778
But thank you.

898
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,747
- Got it.

899
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,482
- I know you do.

900
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,419
[applause]
- Praise the Lord.

901
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,721
- God bless you, Sheila.

902
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:18,857
- Sometimes our prayer simply
needs to be "Lord Jesus,

903
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,660
"help me to learn
to be generous.

904
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,963
To labor and to not
seek reward."

905
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,567
Let us all simply say--
all: Amen.

906
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,703
[shopping carts rattling]

907
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,916
- Well, look who's finally
using the pen.

908
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,487
- Yeah, it just felt
a little crispy.

909
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,856
- Hmm, let me try.
- Uh, no, I'm sure it's fine.

910
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,090
I mean--
- Let me see.

911
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,114
- It's legit.

912
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,119
Good thing,
'cause customer's long gone.

913
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,557
Next time try checking before
they leave the store.

914
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,792
- Good pro tip.

915
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:32,831
- Oh, uh, do anything fun
on your day off?

916
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,534
- Just hung out with my kid.

917
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,668
- Is that all?

918
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,607
- Is there something
you wanna ask me?

919
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,074
- Just making conversation.

920
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:48,714
[gentle music]

921
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:55,821
*

922
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,895
- Are you awake?

923
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:44,002
*

924
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,826
- You know the traditions is
Jordans over a phone line,

925
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,728
right?

926
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,763
- I only had pumps.

927
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,164
- Fair enough.

928
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,206
So what'd you wanna talk
to me about?

929
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:24,209
[gentle music continues]

930
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:31,683
