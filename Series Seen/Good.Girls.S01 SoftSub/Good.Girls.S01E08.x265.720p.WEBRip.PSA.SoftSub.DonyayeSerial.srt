00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:41,703
- There is a difference
between injectables

712
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,487
and injecting heroin.

713
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,185
- Well, this is how we learn.

714
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,708
- I can't believe you made us
do this for nothing.

715
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,275
- Oh, I made you?

716
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:51,408
That's rich coming from you,
Ms. "I ain't askin'."

717
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,020
And you, with your judge-y
face

718
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,412
that I can feel from here,

719
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:56,979
I cannot!

720
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:59,416
'Cause we all know that this
month has been killing you.

721
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,549
- It has not.
- Oh!

722
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,203
You've been crawling
out of your skin

723
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,771
like a frog in a slow boil,
baby.

724
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,077
- She's not wrong.

725
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,166
- Oh, great. You too?
Pile it on.

726
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,559
- Oh, it's all so banal,

727
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:14,562
the PTA, the playdates,
the yoga!

728
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,956
Each day, the flame
grows a little hotter.

729
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,045
- She's been missing
that hood life!

730
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,874
- Right?

731
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,527
Peace.

732
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:27,053
- Whoa, whoa, wait, you're just
gonna leave us here with this?

733
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,837
- You know what?
I did my part.

734
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,621
You handle this.

735
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:33,624
[door opens]

736
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,802
- Wait, wait, wait,
you're leaving too?

737
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,108
- I gotta haul Sara's fast ass
down to the station

738
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,719
and scare her straight.
- Why?

739
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,416
- 'Cause that little heifer
has been slinging

740
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,723
stolen fidget spinners
on the playground.

741
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,854
- Sara?

742
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,595
- Like mother, like daughter,
I guess.

743
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:50,511
- Hey, you know that's not
the reason why.

744
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,470
- Yeah, right.

745
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,995
Love you.

746
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,300
- Love you.

747
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:59,041
[door opens]

748
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,782
- So you just want me
to scare her a little, right?

749
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,045
- I want you to put
the fear of God in her.

750
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,786
Cuff her, Tase her,
pepper spray,

751
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,787
whatever it takes.

752
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,094
- [laughs]

753
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,836
- I'm dead serious.

754
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,925
- Look, I get it.

755
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:14,622
I worry about my kid, too.

756
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:18,104
She's gonna be fine;
you guys are great parents.

757
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:20,193
She has good role models.

758
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:22,151
- Yeah, right.

759
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,941
- You ready to see
how this works?

760
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,333
- Do I have to?

761
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:31,900
- She's ready.

762
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,336
- You like bunk beds, Sara?

763
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,643
- Oh, she's been begging us
for bunk beds.

764
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:37,340
Is that right?

765
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:39,516
- I want you to think of this
as an opportunity

766
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,780
to grow during the downtime.

767
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,347
A chance to really
flip your game,

768
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:48,221
in a way that, if it's not
completely legal,

769
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,311
it is totally FDA-approved.
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,313
- This is essentially
liquid money.

771
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:57,012
I mean, it's literally liquid,
but...

772
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:59,493
- It's garbage.
This stuff's poison.

773
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:02,409
- Not any more so than
the substances your guys deal.

774
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:03,976
- Who would I even sell it to?

775
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,412
- Don't you know someone?

776
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:07,196
- That rolls with a bunch
of middle-aged ladies?

777
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,546
Nah, man, not so much.

778
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,248
How's your rotten egg?

779
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:17,511
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

780
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,861
- You said you handled it.

781
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,471
- I did.

782
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,865
- Then why you trying to play
me with this side-hustle stuff?

783
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,085
I told you, we're shut down.

784
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,651
- And I told you
I have expenses.

785
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,828
I have four children,
a mortgage,

786
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,091
I can't just shut down--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

787
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,266
She got you on the hook,
now, right?

788
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,311
- I said I'm handling it!

789
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,056
- Okay.

790
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,580
[laughs]

791
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,887
You think you're a boss,
now, huh?

792
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:48,368
Your lily ass does two jobs
and all of the sudden,

793
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,283
you think you
run the whole game?

794
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,894
Let me tell you something,
you ain't no boss.

795
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,678
And on the real,
you ain't gonna be nothing

796
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,767
till you get your house
in order.

797
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,859
And you best not put
that stuff in your face.

798
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,427
You don't need it.

799
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,783
- When you're in my house,
you mind your business.

800
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:16,091
You're sharing your space
with gang bangers, murderers,

801
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:19,268
people you don't want to mess
with, let alone sleep next to.

802
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:21,401
- So they just put everyone
in all together?

803
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:24,273
There's not like a separate
white collar cell?

804
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:25,840
- One big melting pot.

805
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:29,800
- You okay, Mom?

806
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,064
- Yeah, you know,
it's just hot in here.

807
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:33,456
- You got chow at 7:00,

808
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,502
clean up at 7:30,
and then, you gotta shower.

809
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,112
- And what does she shower in?

810
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,635
- A group.

811
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,594
You make a circle, then
rotate under the shower head.

812
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:43,249
- No, I meant,
like, shower shoes?

813
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,294
- Your shoes
are your shower shoes.

814
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,643
You don't want to get them wet?

815
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,210
You take your chances
with the fungi,

816
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,777
and don't expect
hot water neither.

817
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,432
- And what if she has to,
um, use the--

818
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,216
- There's your bathroom,

819
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,003
your kitchen, your sink,

820
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,308
everything.

821
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:03,095
- Wait, so people just go
right there?

822
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:06,098
Like, in front of everybody?

823
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,099
Even number--

824
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,578
- All the numbers.

825
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:11,494
And most of the time,
there won't be toilet paper.

826
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:15,498
- Okay. Thank you, Denise,
but I think--

827
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,326
I think she gets it.

828
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,024
- There are things you can do
for a square,

829
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,460
but you don't want to.

830
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,157
- Yeah, well,
we really need to get home.

831
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:23,332
- You're home with me, ladies!

832
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,943
[laughs]

833
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,335
Welcome home!

834
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,467
- Okay, we gotta get
out of here.

835
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,557
- No can do!
It's not rec time.

836
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,386
- Oh my God,
let me out of here!

837
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,962
- Hey, how was your day?

838
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:47,139
- Has our credit rebounded
enough to qualify for a loan?

839
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:50,316
- Well, we put a dent in our
debt, that's for sure.

840
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,013
- Yes or no?
- No.

841
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:56,235
Look, I know you don't want
to tell me what's going on.

842
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,150
- I need cash fast.

843
00:32:58,193 --> 00:32:59,281
- How much?

844
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:01,109
- 10 grand.

845
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:03,024
- Does that have anything to do
with the many vials

846
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,679
of liquid hashish I just saw
in the garage?

847
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,422
- It's not liquid hashish.

848
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,163
- Oh, well...

849
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:12,816
[clears throat]

850
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,470
What is it then?

851
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,388
Why don't you let me help you?

852
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:20,868
- I don't know that you can.

853
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,392
- Maybe not, but what
do you got to lose?

854
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,700
[suspenseful music]

855
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:30,008
- Mr. Boland, I don't have you
down for an appointment today.

856
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,619
- Hey, got a minute?

857
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,577
- I'm with a patient.

858
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:37,754
- It's slow-growing.
You'll be fine.

859
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,105
How's that Buick treating you?

860
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,584
- Fine.

861
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,806
- You know any dermatologists?

862
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,200
- I can't believe
it was all three!

863
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:51,899
You know, like, I would get it
if it was just one, you know?

864
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,466
But...

865
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,730
Oh, God...

866
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:58,558
- Hey.

867
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,516
Want some more water?

868
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,739
- I'm just...

869
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,396
What are we gonna do?

870
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,615
I mean, 'cause I just...

871
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,576
Oh, no, um...

872
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,447
Of course. Yeah.

873
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:21,276
Sure. Um...

874
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,931
Thank you for letting me know.

875
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,585
Yeah, you too.

876
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,021
Okay, bye.

877
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,505
- Sorry, I was just gonna--

878
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,205
You okay?

879
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:38,989
- Yeah, I'm fine.

880
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:49,174
- I mean, your insurance
is gonna cover it, right?

881
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,697
- What are you talking about?

882
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,134
- Sadie told me you got robbed.

883
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,483
- [scoffs]

884
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:57,486
That's like the least of it.

885
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,707
Do I look like a total raccoon
