Born again Boomer don't judge.

141

This came from your register
last night.

Know what it is?

143
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,002
- Hmm, this is a tough one.

144
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,737
It's a curling iron?

145
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,906
- We in the biz say
counterfeit.

146
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,374
Yeah, see, I know
it's counterfeit

147
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,610
because I used the pen.
Did you us the pen?

148
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,911
- Boomer, I don't remember
if I used--

149
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,413
- I'm guessing you didn't
because, if you had,

150
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,614
you would have known
it's counterfeit

151
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,915
which is why we have the pen.

152
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,417
So unfortunately
I'm gonna have to dock this

153
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,752
from your paycheck.
- Whoa, whoa.

154
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,421
Wait, Boomer, that's like
a whole shift for me.

155
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,756
- Well, maybe next time you'll
take security more seriously.

156
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,825
- Come on, what security?

longer is the wait?

'Cause we've been...

160
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,110
- What I'm most concerned
about right now

161
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,912
is Stella's
kidney function.

162
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,448
- Sara.

163
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,715
- What?
- You said Stella.

164
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,183
Her name's Sara.

165
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,654
Okay, so what
about her kidneys?

166
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,156
- One is failing, the other
one's right behind.

167
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,493
I would suggest
that we put Sara

168
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,463
on the list for a transplant
as soon as possible.

169
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,931
- Carla, you just can't throw
files like this.

170
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,834
- But we just got ten walk-ins.
- I've been doing some reading.

171
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:41,935
- Okay.

172
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,804
- 'Cause she can barely make it

173
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,072
through the school day
right now 'cause--

174
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,074
- It's all willy-nilly
over there.

through the day

00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,946
- You might want to keep
her home and get a tutor.

178
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,515
Are those last week's
blood draws?

179
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,216
- My husband and I work
all the time.

180
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,752
So we can't.
- Here, Carla.

181
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,187
Take them all away.

182
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,223
- And the transplant list
can take months right?

183
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,893
- Separate.
Thank you.

184
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,761
- And there's this new drug

185
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,530
that just got approved.
- Take everything out.

186
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,931
- [yelling]
Oh, my God, can you please

187
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,935
just listen to me
for one damn minute?

188
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,705
Shame on you.

189
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,973
Shame on all of you.

190
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:23,544
*

191
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,879
- Eculizumab.

192
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,749
That's the name of the drug
you're talking about.

193
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,083
- Yes.
- It does.

194
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,753
It improves renal function
dramatically.

195
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,955
It's also ten grand a month
out of pocket.

196
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,158
And I'm guessing that may not
be an option.

197
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,127
*

198
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,029
- Well, I'll talk
to my husband.

199
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,997
We might be able to swing it.

200
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,232
[sniffles]

201
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,967
- Okay.

202
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,236
- And she was only halfway
through my wax.

203
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,771
- So what happened?

204
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,573
- Well, now I'm very uneven.

205
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,809
- Okay.
I don't even want to know.

206
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:59,112
- Dean maxed out their credit
card at some lingerie store.

207
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,748
- Do you think
he's sleeping around?

208
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,015
- Don't nobody want Dean.

209
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,884
It's a Christmas gift.
- In October?

210
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,252
- Maybe it's
your anniversary present.

211
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,286
- He already gave me
100 coupons

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,821
to Bed Bath & Beyond.

213
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,123
- Ew, really?
- Son of a bitch.

214
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,892
- No, I really do love it
there.

215
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,528
- No, that old guy
is stealing your tip.

216
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,165
- He can't even walk.

217
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,933
- Go get it.

218
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,779
- Shady S.O.B.
- Eh?

219
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,614
- Shady.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,115
- At my old job we got robbed
all the time

221
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,850
so I got the sixth sense now.

222
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,318
- Are you serious?
- I mean it's no big deal.

223
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,053
All the stores I work
at eventually get hit.

224
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,556
- You could get shot.
- Ugh, one can hope.

225
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,191
These guys, they don't want
to hurt anybody.

226
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,926
They just want the money
so we let them have it.

227
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,127
Nobody's trying to be a hero.

228
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,896
- Do they get caught?

229
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,330
- Yeah, the dumb ones do
'cause they park

230
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,099
in the front
by the security cameras.

231
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,266
You got to put your getaway car

232
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,035
in the back
by the loading dock.

233
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,336
And you never dick around
with the registers.

234
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,305
The real money is back
in the vault.

235
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,340
- You've really worked
this out.

236
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,110
- Just keeping my options open.

237
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,578
- How much is in the vault?

238
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,214
- 30 grand, give or take.

239
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,583
- Damn, I could use that money.

240
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,019
- Oh, my God, me too.

241
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,287
- So when you want to do this?

242
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,089
- Well, I already bought
three automatics

243
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,625
and filed off
the serial numbers

244
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,160
so really, name a day.

245
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,898
[laughs]

246
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,867
You should see your face.

247
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,269
- It's whiter than usual.
[both laughing]

248
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,271
- I'm gonna need you all
to get on the ground

249
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,140
get your cell phones out
of your pockets,

250
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,875
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

251
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,243
All right, good.

252
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,979
Now, I need to you to get
your manager up here.

253
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,949
*

254
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,351
I said you need to get
a manager up here right now.

255
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,356
- Hey! Where's y'all's boss at?

256
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,328
- [yelling] I better get
a manager up here right now

257
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,666
or I will start capping people,
and I'm not even joking.

258
00:09:58,699 --> 00:09:59,700
Mother--
[crash]

259
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,234
[screaming]

260
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,203
Are you the manager?
- Over there.

261
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,905
- Hey.

262
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,273
Hey, you. You!

263
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,710
You, squirmy!
Hey, hey, hey!

264
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,278
Are you in charge here?

265
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,180
- Yes. Yes, I am.

266
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,015
- Okay, then you
listen to me.

267
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,984
You're gonna put
on your big boy panties

268
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,886
and you're gonna tell
your customers to stay calm

269
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,888
and this will be over
real soon.

270
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,122
- Get out of there.

271
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,657
- Everybody stay calm, okay?

272
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,292
- Now you're going to take
my friend here

273
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,294
to the cash vault.

274
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,898
- Move it before I shoot
your face off--let's go!

275
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,033
Now, now, now!

276
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,435
[panting]

277
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,405
[under breath]
Oh, my God.

278
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,374
- Hey, Deadpool, you wanna...

279
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:45,779
.

280
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,213
[pop music]

281
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,084
*

282
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,920
- Ugh.

283
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,894
Seriously?
- You won't call me back.

284
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,830
- I was busy.

285
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,431
- So here I am.

286
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,433
- Well, I'm pretty sure
I'm supposed to be helping

287
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,869
customers not chatting
with my ex, so.

288
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,071
- So, now I'm a customer.

289
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:20,447
Nancy and I are suing
you for custody.

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,482
[beep]

291
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,751
- Club card?

292
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:24,985
- There's a hearing next month.

293
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,920
You should probably
get yourself a lawyer.

294
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,790
- You know if you sign up now
you get 10% off your purchase.

295
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:34,027
- Annie, we were 17
when we decided all this stuff.

296
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,963
Sadie would be happier
with us now.

297
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,898
- How do you figure, Greg?

298
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,167
- We could send her
to private school, St. Anne's.

299
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,803
- She's an atheist
who enjoys a jaunty bow tie.

300
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,005
I don't really think that
Catholic school is a good fit.

301
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,740
- We could get her therapy.

302
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,075
- She doesn't need therapy.

303
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,843
She's figuring out who she is.

304
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,179
- That's all great, but
she's getting bullied, Annie.

305
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,115
- Yes, by dickhead kids
that need therapy.

306
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,188
- Who's watching her now?
It's after midnight.

307
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,924
- The neighborhood girl.
She's very good.

308
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,193
- The one who got the DUI?

309
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,095
- She lives
within walking distance.

310
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,897
- I'm buying her
a new computer.

311
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,199
Hers has been broken
for a month.

312
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,034
- Why didn't she tell me that?

313
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,037
- Because she said she didn't
want to freak you out.

314
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,542
- Why is it so crazy?

315
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,077
I mean it's
a victimless crime.

316
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,512
The store is insured.

317
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,114
Plus, you know they make us
work through lunch

318
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,949
so it's basically tit for tat

319
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,117
when you figure
in the lost wages.

320
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,785
- Oh, that will hold up
in court.

321
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:32,786
- [sighs]
- Hey, no pop

322
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,087
before dinner, sweetie.

323
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,488
- But she gets it.

324
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,090
- That's because I am
a grown up.

325
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,525
- Technically.

326
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,027
- Okay, you know,
can't you just have my back

327
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,929
on, like, one thing ever?

328
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,032
- This isn't me telling Mom
and Dad that you smoked pot.

329
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,134
- Which was incredibly lame,
by the way.

330
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,037
- This is me helping you
not ruin your life.

331
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,207
- Oh, because your life
is so great.

332
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,009
I should want this life?

333
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,245
- I didn't say that.
- You're like the Stepford mom

334
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,913
without a pulse.
- I never said that.

335
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,882
- You're cutting
chicken fingers into stars.

336
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,884
They're already fingers.

337
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,857
And, I mean, not to pile on,
but look who you married.

338
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,992
- It's 20 years
and four children.

339
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,261
Marriage sometimes
takes a little work.

340
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,865
- Wow. That is so romantic.

341
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,267
- You could lose your daughter.
Has that occurred to you?

342
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,604
- Well seeing as Greg
is suing me for custody

343
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,539
and I can't afford
to fight it,

344
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:31,211
yes, actually, the thought
has crossed my mind.

345
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,080
- I didn't know.

346
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,184
- Now you know.

347
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,886
- Hey, there, Amber here

348
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,520
over at Boland Motors.

349
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,891
- Jeez, who'd this chick

So what are you waiting for?

352
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,597

353
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,101
So come on down
to Boland Motors

- Is your babysitter free?

357

- Mm, they took away
her license.

358

She's always home.

359
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,078
- It's this charge right here.

360

Could you just tell me exactly
what was bought?

361

it's on her bill, so.

what she bought.

But then she was
in an accident.

370
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,909
- With a driver texting.

371
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,244
- Yeah, well it was
the other driver texting.

372
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,612
Not my friend.
She would never do that.

373
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,049
But anyway, she's been
in a coma ever since

374
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,650

00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,022
Um, I just thought, wouldn't it
be a nice gesture

- Hey, when she wakes up.

378

Stay positive.

379
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,127

of undies waiting.

380

'Cause she was actually
wearing the last pair

381

when she got in the accident.
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,167
Mm-hmm, and the paramedics
had to cut them

off of her, you know,

384

the size that I got.

385

And I obviously feel stupid
asking her family.

386

- No, can't do that.
- So could you just look it up?

something for you.

on hand?

We stole it.

560
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,869
And maybe the cops
don't follow up on $30,000.

They damn sure follow up
on half a million dollars.

- What do we do?
- Nothing.

563

704
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,395
Sorry to be crass here,
but, uh...

705
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,064
Horny.

706
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,298
Too.

707
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,167
I just want to shoot
my mouth off.

708
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,405
Talk and talk until I'm...

709
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:13,112
.

710
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:13,545
[soft music]

711
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:20,086
*

712
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,988
- Can we just get it over
with, okay?

713
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,023
- All right, hey, hey.

714
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:28,060
I'm not some wham, bam,
thank you ma'am.

715
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:31,263
You know?
I need a little romance.

716
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:38,537
*

717
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,180
- Mom.

718
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,117
- Hi, honey.
I thought you were asleep.

719
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,519
And...here it is!

720
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,187
Found it.

721
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:58,024
He lost some change
in the couch so I was...

722
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,358
just helping him find it.

723
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,994
- Thanks, thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

724
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,596
Oh, Sadie, honey,
this is my, uh,

725
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,968
Boomer.
I work with him at work.

726
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,169
- Hi.
- You know, so,

727
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,603
but he has to go now.

728
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,273
Because he was--he has to--
- Uh...

729
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,909
Use quarters on the
vending machines, I was gonna--

730
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,246
and maybe fill a meter or two,
you know, surprise someone.

731
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,614
- Hey, that's nice.
- Yeah, pay it forward.

732
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,984
Or whatever.
- [whispers] Just go.

733
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,555
- You know, uh...

734
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:33,025
Since I have all this
bus fare now,

735
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,027
I'll probably be back
real soon.

736
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,296
[door opens]

737
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,365
[door closes]

738
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,902
- Morning.

739
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,709
I'm gonna need the PINs
and passcodes to the accounts.

740
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:55,147
Mortgage, bank, credit cards.

741
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,415
- Uh...

742
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,617
It's "2fast2furious."

743
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,186
It's the number two.

744
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,653
You know, like the movie.

745
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,190
- I know it's a movie.

746
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,392
That's for all of them?

747
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,594
- Yeah.

748
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,229
- I handled the mortgage.

749
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,298
- [stammers]
But how'd you do that?

750
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,034
- I handled it
because you couldn't.

751
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,337
And this thing that we do...

752
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,407
Where you bring home the bacon,
and I don't ask any questions,

753
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,742
that's--that's over.

754
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,212
- Does that mean we get
to stay in the house?

755
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:29,115
- It means I get to stay
in the house with the kids.

756
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,183
You get to go to a motel.

757
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,085
Your clothes are in the car.

758
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,356
- Still no leads
on last week's

759
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,458
armed robbery
of Fine and Frugal.

760
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,360
A rep from the local police--
- You don't think it's weird?

761
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,095
- What?

762
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,763
- Our GoFundMe page
has been up for years.

763
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,333
Some anonymous donor rolls
in now with all that cash?

764
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,069
- It's a miracle.

765
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,138
Why question it?

766
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,144
[both laughing]

767
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,182
See this?

768
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,383
- I do.

769
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,053
- Yeah, yeah?
[both laughing]

770
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,255
[gentle music]

771
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,024
*

772
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,393
- Our girl's coming back.
- Yeah.

773
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,262
- [laughs]

774
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,430
- Hey, oh--oh--
okay, bruiser.

775
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,299
All right, ease up now.
You got him.

776
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,334
- Ugh!
- Look at you.

777
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,136
[dog whimpers]

778
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,140
- Hey, buddy, what's wrong?

779
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,708
You need to go potty?

780
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,243
Need to pee-pee?

781
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:34,480
- Nah, he's good.
- [screams]

782
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,348
- We already took him out.

783
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:42,221
- What do you want?
- Oh, relax, sweetheart.

784
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,822
I just need you to call
your lady friends

785
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,692
over so we can all have...

786
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,160
A little talk.

787
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,461
- About what?

788
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:52,064
- Oh, about the money
you stole from us.

789
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,499
*

790
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:56,402
.

791
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:57,035
- Yo, this backsplash is dope.

792
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,806
What's that made out of,
marble?

793
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,542
Yo, you ever get any problems
with staining back here?

794
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,344
Like if you cookin' a big pot
of spaghetti sauce

795
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,513
or something like that?

796
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,415
- No, I don't think so.

797
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:10,849
- No?

798
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,418
Hmm.

799
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,653
- We didn't know you
owned the store.

800
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,424
- [chuckles]

801
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:22,294
I look like some kind of
grocery store manager to you?

802
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:25,331
What, like Rotary Club
or somethin'?

803
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,566
Nah, let's just say that we got
certain "arrangements"

804
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,701
with some local businesses.

805
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,438
I mean, we help each other out
and what not, you know?

806
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,873
- Like money laundering
for drugs?

807
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,775
[whispers]
Told you it was shady.

808
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,677
- Why don't you stop worrying
about my business dealings

809
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,313
and start figuring how you
gonna pay me my money back.

810
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:42,448
- We can get it back.

811
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:43,849
- That'd be great.

812
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,385
- Most of it.

813
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,754
- Sorry, what?
- Some of it for sure.

814
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,656
- [chuckles]

815
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,359
- [exhales] Oh, what, like
you guys didn't spend a dime?

816
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,726
- How much, Annie?
- I don't know.

817
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,496
I don't know, I probably
spent like--like 100.

818
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,565
Grand.
- What?

819
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,333
I'm gonna shoot you myself.

820
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:05,437
- Nah, you just gonna pay me
back is all.

821
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:08,740
And right quick too.
With interest.

822
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,443
- [crying]

823
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:15,481
- So...see you real soon, yeah?

824
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:18,584
You know, you really got
to be careful, ladies.

825
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,686
I mean, with citrus on marble,

826
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,621
like lemon and whatnot,

827
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,490
that stuff will erode
like crazy.

828
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:27,926
*

829
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,728
- Why can't Daddy come home?

830
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,431
- Your Daddy
and I love you so much.

831
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,899
And I know it's confusing.

832
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,501
Daddy's got to stay here
while he and I work on

833
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:36,802
some grown up stuff.

834
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,370
You can have whatever
candy you want

835
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:39,438
from the vending machines,
okay?

836
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,706
all: Yay!

837
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,208
- Hey.
- Pick the kids up from school

838
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,642
and bring them straight
back here.

839
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,710
Don't go to the park
or anywhere.

840
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,412
- I can't have the kids here.

841
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,646
I've got like one twin bed.
- You have to.

842
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,416
You just have to.

843
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,783
- What's going on?

844
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,519
- I can't tell you.
- Wait, stop.

845
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,554
Are you okay?

846
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,823
Just take care of my babies.

847
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,729
- Hey, who wants--
who wants pizza?

848
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,731
- I do!
- Yay! Me! Me!

849
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,667
*

850
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,935
- I would have picked you up

851
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,837
down the block,
but your cell was off.

852
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,941
- Where's the Porsche?

853
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,776
- I sold it.

854
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,511
I had to.

855
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,580
[car door shuts]

856
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,682
- Is that a cassette deck?

857
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,816
- What?

858
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,819
- And manual roll down
windows?

859
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,689
Yas, queen.

860
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,759
Mm-hmm, cloth interior.
Nice.

861
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,427
Leather burns your ass.

862
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,229
- How'd you get
to be so awesome?

863
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,265
- I don't ride in Porsches.

864
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,674
[door lock jingles]

865
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,517
- [deep voice]
Who is it?

866
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,689
I said, who is it?

867
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,692
- Me.

868
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,927
- Stan!

869
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,896
- [chuckling]
What the hell are you doing?

870
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,298
- I want an alarm system,

871
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,032
and you--please fix
the back gate.

872
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,968
- I said I would.
- Yeah, you said it.

873
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,670
But it just sits there
wide open.

874
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,606
- You got your bat out.

875
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,007
You know you could have gotten
a knife out the drawer, baby.

876
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,542
All right, all right.

877
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,776
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- God.

878
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,011
- Calm down.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

879
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,313
You scared?
Your hearts beating.

880
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,881
Come here. Breathe.

to them that--

That we meant well?

we didn't mean to piss
off the gang.

We just wanted to rob
the grocery store.

If you have a better plan--

916

We should take it
from somewhere else.

917
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,972
We'll just steal it,
and then we'll pay them back.

918
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,774
And then we'll just put
the whole thing to bed.

of your mind?

harder than this.

and gluten free.

an allergy attack.
