Uh, we're trying to keep it
cleanish in here.

Hey, how do you feel
about tacos?

184
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,837
We could do a little cheese,
a little pico de gallo

185
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,172
- Yeah, I feel good.

186
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,607
- Oh, yay!
Fun!

187
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,776
Okay, uh, I am off to work.

188
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,544
- Good luck saving lives.

189
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,617
- [laughs]

190
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,452
Love you.
- Love you.

191
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,032
- What you making?
Pico de gallo?

192
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,668
- Yeah.

193
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,940
- Um...

194
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:24,211
I have sort of a favor to ask.

195
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,679
- How much?

196
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,948
- Just, like, 60.

197
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,952
- All right.
- Grand.

198
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,020
It'll be more like
a loan this time.

199
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,254
I'll totally pay you back.

200
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,689
- What is the matter with you?

201
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,257
- It's not like you can't
afford it.

202
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,826
Look at this place.
There's orchids everywhere.

203
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,260
You have an in-ground pool.

204
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,596
- What do you need
that much money for?

205
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,833
- For a very good reason.

206
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,969
- You, uh, hire a lawyer yet?

207
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,972
- Do you actually think
I would ask you for money

208
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,575
to fight you for custody?

209
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,709
- Are ya?

210
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:56,977
- I wasn't,
but now that

211
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,912
you're accusing me of it,
maybe I should.

212
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,716
So, can I have the money?

213
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,051
- No, you freak!

214
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,553
- Why do you have
to be such a dick?

215
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,887
- Because you're insane.

216
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,789
I mean, you never think
anything through.

217
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,659
This is exactly why Nancy and I
should have custody,

218
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,627
because you are not stable.

219
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,096
- Yeah, because who cares about
real love and connection

220
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,533
when you can make a child
a fresh pico de gallo?

221
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,903
- Why do you keep saying that?

222
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,006
- Thank you for making me
completely humiliate myself

223
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,641
for no reason.

224
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,810
These are cold.

225
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,278

- Eww.

227
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,750
What do we do now?

228
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,318
- I have no idea.

How much is that?

240
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,082
- $7.95.

241
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,652
- Yeah, see, but if I order
two hot cakes,

242
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,088
two sausages, and two eggs
a la carte, it's cheaper.

All of it.
I swear.

- Everything's good.

- So, uh, what are you
driving now?

- A 2007 Celica G.T.

quite an upgrade.

I mean, she handles
like a dream.

- My Celica's been good to me,

292
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,714
but she's pushing 100,000
miles, so...

293
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:21,849
- She's dependable.

294

- Sad to see her go,
but...

295
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,053
I think it's time to
change things up a bit.

296

- I thought the
exact same thing.

297
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,056
- I'm sorry?

298
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,758
- You know, you see something
shiny and new

299
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,860
and you just forget
about what you got.

300
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,294
Once you upgrade,
those memories,

301
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,096
they come back and they--
they haunt you.

00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,734
You know like, uh,
road trip with the kids.

303

- Oh, I don't have kids.

304
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:46,506
- The fun stuff you did in
the backseat in high school.

305
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,242
- I haven't had it that long,
so...

306
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,211
- The crazy thing is,
you thought you were the one

307
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,280
sick of her,
and now you'd do anything

308
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,848
to get her back.

309
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,986
- You--you do sell cars here,
right?

310
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,521
- Don't give up on your Celica.

311
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,824
- Maybe...
Maybe if we test drove it--

312
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,892
- You'll regret it.

313
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,095
- Yeah, uh, okay.

Water break!

321
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,881
- [groaning]
She needs water.

322
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,249
- Come on, girls.
Get back in the game.

323
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,952
- Excuse me?
Can we keep it together please?

324
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,153
- She shouldn't overdo it.

325
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,187
- She's doing great.
She's fine.

326
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,188
Look at her.

327
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,124
- Yeah, I see.

328
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,059
And what about when we can't
afford that damn truck anymore?

329
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,160
What happens then?

330
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,261
- Cops get real good insurance.

331
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,262
- You're not a cop yet.

332
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,330
- Yeah, I will be.

333
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,765
- Yeah, in six months, babe.

334
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,336
- Okay.
Okay, look.

335
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,238
I know you're not used to this.

336
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,239
- Used to what?

337
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,974
- Neither am I.

338
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,042
I mean, we haven't been here
in a long time.

339
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,243
- What are you talking about?

340
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,311
- This.
Right here, right now.

341
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,948
It's what winning feels like,
babe.

to run and play in the sunshine

I don't know about you,

but I'm gonna drink
in this moment.

346
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,023
- Fine, drink up.

347
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,860
- Oh, I'm gonna need a little
bit more than that.

348
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,294
- Excuse me?

349
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,163
- I'm gonna need you to say it.

350
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,266
- You're crazy.

351
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,834
- Say it with me.

352
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,035
We are winning.

353
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,871
- We're winning.

354
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,405
- Yeah, I'm sure you can do
a lot better than that.

355
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,808
- We are winning.

356
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,079
- Mean it.
Come on, baby.

357
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,016
- We're winning.

358
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,151
- Yes,
that's what I'm talking about!

- Such is life.

537

541

Can you believe that?

543
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,596
They're just too into
their own lives.

Oh, and this is his fiancee.
Isn't she pretty?

00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,407
- Very.

but she's only half.

How about some of this
no-calorie lemonade?

where's your restroom?

You know what?
Tell them there is no TV.

She had this full life

I found back there?

- What?

616
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,647
- Moles.
Those tiny little rat thingies

617

that build tunnels.

618

We got them, like,
really bad.

I have the moles.

paid the mortgage for,

- For how long?

- Oh.

You can throw chewed-up

into the mole hole and...

633
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,732
They'll choke and die.

- In the middle of the night?

- You have to reheat at 350,
okay?

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,911
- What, do you plan
on going somewhere?

643
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:19,912
- Where would I be going?

644
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,681
- You tell me.

645
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:22,849
You don't wanna act like
you're not gonna be around

00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,735
I might come.

- I'm sorry,
it's my imaginary island.

655
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,840
- An island for what?

656
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,175

you can make conjugal visits.

Why aren't you in bed?

Well, there's something you
need to know about mommies.

Sometimes they go away.

But guess what?

that word?

a nightlight.

- What?
- Sadie.

696
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,221
She sleeps with a nightlight,
okay?

697
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,023
- She's 11 years old.

698
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,925
- Yes, I know that.
That's why you just turn it on

699
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,159
and you walk out of the room
so you don't embarrass her.

700
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,795
- What time is it?

701
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:49,996
- And she doesn't like
to swallow pills,

702
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,063
so you have to make sure
that you get her

703
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,331
the gummy vitamins, okay?

704
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,166
- Wha--what are you doing here?

705
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,202
- And she's gonna need to start
wearing a bra soon,

706
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,004
so don't get her anything
too girly.

707
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,072
Just get her something like
tank tops or something

708
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,340
so that she can
have them layered.

709
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,042
- Annie, Annie, Annie,
Annie, Annie.

710
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,880
- I'm not gonna fight you
for custody.

711
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:10,282
- Seriously?

712
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,954
Why--why not?

713
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,789
- Because I'm dealing
with some stuff.

714
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:19,959
And...
I just can't.

715
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,097
And she's a kid,
you know.

716
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,999
- Uh-huh.

717
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,368
- So don't make her take off
her shoes in her own house.

718
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:41,780
.

719
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:42,214
- How much is there?

720
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,216
- Same as yesterday.

721
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,417
- Costa Rica?

722
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,552
- Bugs.

723
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,188
- We cannot run.
We have families.

724
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,958
- All right.
China.

725
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,960
- Earthquakes.

726
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,527
- That's your big issue
with China?

727
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,363
- You have a better problem
with China?

728
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,431
- [scoffs] Language barrier,
human rights violations,

729
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,167
communistic rule.

730
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,169
- We're staying here,
and we are facing this.

731
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:04,904
- Air pollution.
Swine flu.

732
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,505
I mean--
- They don't have Indian food.

733
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,340
I need to go someplace
where they have Indian food.

734
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,010
- India?
- God, no.

735
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,378
- Who keeps IM'ing you?

736
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,380
- Oh, I put Hans up on ebay.

737
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,182
- Who's Hans?

738
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,450
- The little drummer boy
I stole from Boomer's granny.

739
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,352
- Annie, that is an heirloom.

740
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,354
- Who's she gonna
pass it down to?

741
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:23,956
Alba?

742
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,592
Or her only one quarter Mexican
grandchildren?

743
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,294
[beeping]

744
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,561
- Holy mother.

745
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,596
- What?

746
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,865
- Hans is up to eight g's.

747
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,600
- What?
- Shut the front door.

748
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,304
- Did you take anything else?

749
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,922
- You're short.
- No, we're not.

750
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:58,324
- Yeah, you are.

751
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,892
- Actually...

752
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,962
We're over.

753
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:08,500
See, these are super
rare collectables.

754
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,337
- Treasures.
- Yes, sister, you are correct.

755
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,571
That's a better word for these.

756
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,375
Because these super
rare treasures

757
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:20,379
go for 10 to 15 g's on ebay.

758
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,647
How much leg work is there,
right?

759
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,250
But the truth is,
it's very little.

760
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:27,653
Because we have done the lion's
share of the work for you.

761
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,255
Ruby?

762
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:31,023
- These are the usernames
and passwords

763
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,558
for our ebay accounts.

764
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:36,595
Plus auction tips to maximize
your profits.

765
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,534
- You want me
to sell your dolls?

766
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,070
- Tell him about Hans.

767
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,638
- Ooh, our little drummer boy.

768
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:51,343
The pride of Hamburg.
[laughs]

769
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,013
You see, Hans here is one
of only 12 in the entire--

00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,983
[shatters]
all: [screaming]

771
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,323
11 in the world.

772
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,626
- This some kind
of joke to you?

773
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,564
I'm done playing with you guys.

774
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:21,007

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,343
- [screams]

776
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,677
What are they doing?

777
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,146
- Making it look like
a home invasion.

778
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,714
- So they can kill us?

779
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,983
- Please don't do this!
- Wait, please, wait!

780
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:32,451
We can get you the money,
I swear!

781
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,719
Please!
- We have families!

782
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:34,753
- Please!
- We have kids!

783
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,056
[both crying and screaming]

784
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,757

788
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,567
- You're an idiot.

789
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,136
- [crying] Beth!

790

791
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,039
- What, are you gonna
blow our brains out

792
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,573
all over the room?

793
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,142
'Cause that's how it works,
right?

794
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,676
Someone shorts you,
and they get tossed out

795
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,111
like trash?

796
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,148
And no one cares,
and no one even notices.

797
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,551
Your problem this time is
that's not us.

798
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,053
We're normal people.

799
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,155
*

800
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,722
We pay our taxes and...

*

802
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,193
We take our kids
to P.F. Chang's,

803
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,463
and we take orange slices
to soccer games.

804
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,132
*

805
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,101
And when bad things happen
to good people,

806
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,104
everyone else goes crazy.

807
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,106
It's all over the news.

808
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:31,110
And there are all these
hashtags and movements.

809
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,411
Because if it could
happen to us,

810
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,413
it could happen to anyone.

811
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:38,450
So if you wanna invite
all that attention

812
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,719
over a few grand,

813
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,490
then you're not the smart
businessman you think you are.

814
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,692
Now, roll the dice.

815
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,127
Tell him to pull the trigger.

817
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:53,799

This was my favorite
sangria bowl.

- Well, it could have
been your face.

829

- L'chaim.

- Are you joking?

843
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,708
- I'm not gonna get a ticket.

your perfect record

845

of armed robbery
and kidnapping?

846
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,812
- I mean, he couldn't have
gone that far.

847
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,447
His hands are tied.
- I don't know.

I mean, remember that
Gulf War vet

849
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,283
on our block growing up?

850
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,618
He ran marathons with both his
arms blown off.

- You brought it up!

Damn, that was amazing, though.

find this guy?

- Yes, I'm trying!
- Then what?

855

We shove him back up

he's going?

if you go to the cops,

00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:16,868
so will I.
