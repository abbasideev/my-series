00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,370
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

3
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,073
- Are we going
to lose this house?

4
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,374
- No.
I mean, I don't know.

5
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,276
- Nancy and I are
suing you for custody.

6
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,610
- Can I have lunch money?

7
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,213
- Those kids take it again?
Douchebags.

8
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,414
- The drug that
you're talking about?

9
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,116
Ten grand a month,
out of pocket.

10
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,385
And I'm guessing
that may not be an option.

11
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,752
- How much is in the vault?

12
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,354
- 30 grand,
give or take.

13
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,256
- So when do you wanna do this?

14
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,126
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a robbery.

15
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,661
- You know how fast
they're gonna lock you up?

16
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,263
- [screams]
[glass clinks]

17
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,431
- [pants]

18
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,667
- He wants us to pick something
up for him in Canada.

19
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,338
It's wrapping paper.
It's just wrapping paper.

20
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,739
I just need to know
we're good.

21
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,541
I'm gonna need
to hear you say it.

22
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,775
- We're good.

23
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,445
- Here's to going
back to normal life.

24
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,679
- L'chaim to that.

25
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,117
- So what'd you
wanna talk to me about?

26
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,853
- Mom, mom, mom.

27
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,622
It's not fair.

28
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,557
For Tommy's birthday, we all
went out to a Pistons game.

29
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,560
We got box seats, and his mom
bought us all jerseys.

30
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,862
And then--
and then after that,

31
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,564
they rented a hotel
with room service.

32
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,400
- Yeah, and now Tommy's mom
can't afford college.

33
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,169
- Well, I want
a birthday party.

34
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,304
- How about a sleepover?
- With a chocolate fountain.

35
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,273
- You could nuke a Hershey bar.
- Mama?

36
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,707
- This is the worst
birthday ever.

37
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,376
- Mama?

38
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,644
- Listen, well, we can't just
afford a really big,

39
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,146
fancy party right now.
We just can't.

40
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,547
- Mama?

41
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,715
- But I promise you,
I'm gonna make it special.

42
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,883
I promise you, okay.

43
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,319
- Mama!
- What is it?

44
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,655
- Who's the man?
- What man?

45
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,823
- The man on my bed.

46
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,826

Hey, you wanna go swimming
at your dad's?

53
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,499
- Yay!

54
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,666
- Yay.

[indistinct chatter]

57
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,514
- Yo, Ruby.

58
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,217
- [sighs] That's my name,
don't wear it out.

59
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,585
- How does one become
a waitress here?

60
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,920
- Excuse me?

61
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,688
- Like, what college
has the best program?

62
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,757
[chuckling]

63
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,259
- I'll check if we're hiring.

64
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,293
- Do you have
to buy the uniform?

65
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,761
'Cause that's some--

66
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,730
I mean, that's some high
quality polyester right there.

67
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,266
I mean, that would set me back,
what--ten bucks?

68
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,635
- Ah [chuckles].

69
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,405
- Just go make him
another one.

70
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,242
He can't eat this now.

71
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,877
Come on,
chop-chop, Ruby.

72
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,214
- Is there a problem,
milkshake?

73
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,482
- What'd you call me?

74
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,551
- It's a trick I use
to remember orders.

75
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,255
Since I didn't go to college
and my memory's not so great.

76
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,323
You always order
that milkshake,

77
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,558
which you never finish,

78
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,560
so you can be sure
to leave my tip

79
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,695
in the bottom
of your nasty ass cup.

80
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,265
My two percent tip.

81
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,999
Three, if you're
feeling generous.

It's not the money that I mind.

I mean, if you can't afford it,
I get it.

85
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,376
I feel for you.

86
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,712
But please, let me know if
there's anything that I can do

87
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,983
to make your experience here
more delightful.

00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,419
No? Well, then,
I'd appreciate it

89
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:42,423
if you left your
85 cents on the table,

90
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,659
and not in your shake today.

91
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,796
Cool?
Okay.

is leaving, choo-choo--ow!

Zipper.

What? What're you doing?
We--we're gonna be late.

101
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,925

00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,361
- Excuse me?
I just got you these.

103
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,496
You told me they were "lit AF."

104
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,632
- They're too big.
They fall down.

105
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,700
- These are not too big.
No way.

106
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,770
I mean, you'd have
to really yank on them.

107
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,005
Hey, why are you so worried
about your pants falling down?

108
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,342
- I'm not.

109
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,610

Tell me.

pulling your pants down?

117
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,765

we'll buy you some belts.

120
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,977
Maybe something pink,
and pretty,

121
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,346
and girly, and sparkly, and--
alright, all right, all right.

122
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,781
Not the money maker.

Not the money maker.

Just hurry up,
put something on.

tell us what's going on?

Oh, my God.

- Who is that?
- I don't know.

131
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,433
- What do you mean
you don't know?

132
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,501
- I mean, I came back
from the grocery store

133
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,968
and he was
just there.

134
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,039
And, I mean, I'm assuming
he's, like, an associate

of the gangbanger.

136
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,476

we were done with that.

God, this sounds so crazy
even saying it--

141
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,784

we don't need the money.

We all still need the money.

149
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,100

156
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,144
that we would possibly,

157
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,481
if the circumstances
were right,

158
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,616
pick up another load
of the fake cash.

- You volunteered us?

160
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,987
- It's not drugs.
It's paper.

161
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,022
I mean, it's literally paper.

162
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,459
- You can't sign people up
for criminal activity

163
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,793

164
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,595

just help me

165
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,963
get this person out of
my house right now?

166
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,197
- Oh, you want some help now?

167
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,166
I'm sorry, why don't you
call your BFF,

168
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,868
the other gangbanger?

I don't even know
that guy's name.

171

- No, but I bet--

172
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,509
I bet he does, right?

173
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,978
Maybe I can, uh...

174
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,814
Okay, I guess I'll do it.
- Yeah, mm-hmm, I'm not.

175
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,518

Please.

00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,119

00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,703
Oh, God, okay.
Well, this is not a phone.

183
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,705
Just--just,
t--take this, take it.

184
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,974
Just take it.

Ugh.
Okay.

00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,888
I have it,
I have it.

190
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,990
- What's the last number
he called?

191
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,692
- Papa John's.

192
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,694
- The last person, Annie.

193
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:44,965
- "Mom," "Mom,"
"Mom," "Mom," "Mom..."

194
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,934
- Oh, my God, why didn't
he just go to his mom's?

195
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,803
- "Mom," "Mom," "Mom..."
- I know, seriously.

196
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,239
- "Mom" and...

197
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,577
"Rio."

198
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,112
- That is not what I meant when
I said we'd do another job.

199
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,614
Who is that guy?

200
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,715
- He works for me.

201
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,651
- Do--does he wash the money?

202
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,986
- Regardless, there's been
a miscommunication.

203
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,522
- Oh, so you think you can pick
and choose what you wanna do

204
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,957
and when you wanna do it?

205
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,759
- She thought it would be
like driving for Uber.

206
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,226
- Who's at fault
is not important.

207
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,697
We are not qualified to take
care of a gunshot victim.

208
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,134
I mean, your friend needs
professional medical attention.

You're shaking your head.
Why are you shaking your head?

210
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,137
- 'Cause that kid
ain't going to no hospital.

211

- Why not?

212
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,874
- 'Cause there's people
looking for him.

213
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,009
- What if those people
show up here?

214
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,210
- Trust me, ain't nobody
gonna shoot up

that is not gonna work.

- He's up there in
my daughter's bed.

226
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,573
I'm never gonna get
that blood out.

227
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:02,042
- I mean, she could sleep
on the floor.

228
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,644
Kids love that stuff.

229
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,213
- I'm pretty sure it'll cover
a new mattress.

230

- So, would we get
that money now, or...?

233
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,657
- When I pick him up.

234
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,059
- When's that?
- When I pick him up.

235
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,128
- Sounds fair.

236
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,765
- So, we got a deal, ladies?

237
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,135
Or what?

- What happened after
they crossed the border?

246
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,690
- Wish I knew.

- Yeah.
- Please.

251
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,802
So, just so I got this,
okay, these women,

252
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,704
they took a car--
- Stole.

253

I mean, they stole a car.

254
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,340
- And drove it over the border.

255

- Mmm.

- And the one
that works with you?

263

- Oh, I mean, if anyone
got radicalized, it's her.

[laughs]
- I bet.

265

What's her name?
- Annie.

She lived in my dorm.

- What?
- Ah, we both loved Hoobastank.

268

- Wait, hold on a second--
- But it didn't matter.

269
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,717
I was stuck I the friend zone.
- No.

270
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,151
- Just like you, right?
- No, that's not it at all,

271
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,753
actually.
- You sure about that, Leslie?

272
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:56,423
- They have committed crimes.
I can prove it.

273
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,891
Well, I can't prove it.

274
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,160
But I can.

275
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,394
But I can't.

I'll do a little digging, okay?

But you gotta do
something for me too.

- Go to O'Brien's.
You know the bar on Birmingham?

00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,441
Have a couple of cocktails,

282
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:18,145
and find yourself a nice girl.

283
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,015
Preferably one
that's interested in you.

284
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,183
- And you know
what they call it?

285
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,152
- What?
- A sizzling skillet.

286
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,387
It says sizzling right there
in the menu.

287
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,521
What does that tell you?

288
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,159
- Uh, that it might be hot?
- That it might be hot.

289
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,995
- Might not wanna touch that.
- You think?

290
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,429
And now they're threatening
to lawyer up.

291
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,065
- What?

292
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,501
What does Tony say?
- That I have to apologize.

293
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,804
- Well, all right, then.

294
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,338
- Why should I apologize?

295
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,141
Because I didn't tell
that idiot that the boiling,

00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,443
bubbling, sizzling platter
in front of him

297

- Yeah, why?

That's why you go back
in there and you suck it up.

we might not make it.

- Stan, you should see
these kids.

314
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,182
They come in there.

315
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,484
They're so rude
and disrespectful

316
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,954
and act like they're better
than everyone else.

317

- Uh, you know I get
called Paul Blart, like,

Now, but I take it,

322
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,534
because at the end of the day,

323
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,369
I got this to come home to.

324
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,572

she stayed up all night.

I slept next to her
like a baby.

- Is he still out cold?

338
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,173
- Um, maybe we need, like,
smelling salts or something.

- Right, 'cause it's 1892.

527
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,819
- Just say you're sorry.

528
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,020
She is sorry.

529
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,788
- And yet we still
haven't heard it.

530
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,790
Do you all have children?
- I do.

531
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:01,561
- Look at the example
you're setting.

532
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,863
- [mouthing words]

533
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,799
*

534
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,368
- I'm sorry.

535
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,569
Okay?

536
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,371
- Thank you, Ruby.
- It's not okay.

537
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:14,040
That was completely insincere.
And kind of bitchy.

538
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,511
- Oh, you want me to mean it?
- That'd be nice.

539
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:21,414
- I'm sorry.
How was that?

540
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,750
- That's great.
- Ah, no, no, no.

541
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,486
Wait a second, Tony.
- Eh--

542
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,989
- Let me give it another go.

543
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,924
I'm sorry.

544
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,927
*

545
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,331
I'm sorry you're too stupid to
understand basic human decency,

546
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,568
and how to treat anyone--
especially service people--

547
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,802
with respect.

548
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,837
- She doesn't mean that.
- No, I do.

549
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,906
I am one sorry bitch.
- Ah...

550
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,542
- I'm sorry you have your head
so far up your ass

551
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,411
that you think it's okay
to blame everyone else

552
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,646
for your son being a moron.

553
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,749
I'm sorry he's such
a punk-ass bitch

554
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,886
because that is a surface burn.

555
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,656
And I am especially sorry that
the friends you bring in here

556
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,027
are as entitled and as spoiled
and as awful as you,

557
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,097
because if kids like you all
are our future,

558
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,099
God help us all.

559
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,568
Now, that's what
I'm sorry about.

560
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:22,775
*

561
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,979
I'll go clean out my locker.

562
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,686
.

563
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,120
[funk music]

564
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:42,795
*

565
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,532
- Ah.

566
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,767
- Uh, uh, uh.

567
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,974
*

568
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,478
- Seriously?

569
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,549
- I upgraded you
to the 32-inch.

570
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,852
And got it for you
at wholesale price.

571
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,187
- Why?

572
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,690
I wanna do something nice.

573
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,092
- Why?

574
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,662
- So that maybe
we could start fresh.

575
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:18,097
- Why?

576
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,734
- I've been praying on it
and...

577
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:25,104
I'm not proud of my part
in everything.

578
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,607
- Oh, so this is like

579
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,010
an "I'm sorry I tried
to rape you" cake?

580
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,614
- That was too many words.

581
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,715
- Whoa.

582
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,850
- Hey, there's
the birthday boy, huh?

583
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,953
[chuckles]
Hey, check it out.

584
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,055
This is for you.

585
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,457
- What is it?

586
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,792
- Well, just a little
something.

587
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,628
Some exfoliant,
a little--little scrub,

588
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:52,532
loofah, some--
bubble bath, you know?

589
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,567
You, uh, like
to take baths, huh?

590
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,602
- Okay.

591
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,504
- Get yourself
all squeaky clean?

592
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,370
- Okay.

593
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,807
Ah, you managed to make
that disgusting.

594
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,509
[clears throat]

595
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,544
- Hey, you got
turkey pinwheels, huh?

596
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,980
- Yeah, feel free to grab some
on your way out.

597
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:11,951
*

598
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,954
- Hey, how much do you think
they'd pay for this party?

599
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,124
- I have no idea.

600
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,760
*

601
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,929
- He's lined up
in the shotgun...

602
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,097
- Oh, oh, oh,
are we still up?

603
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,500
- No, tied 21-21.

604
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,769
Wester caught a two-yard
end zone pass, wide open.

605
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,804
- Ah, come--
- That's PI, that is PI.

606
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,139
- Come on, fellas.
- Every single time.

607
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,507
We never get the call.
- Really?

608
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,642
- Why don't we get that call?

609
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,010
Look at this.
[sighs]

610
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,646
- So how you holding up, man?

611
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,782
You know, with everything
that's going on.

612
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,517
- Great.
- Good.

613
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,018
- Yeah, we're doing great.
- All right.

614
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:49,021
- I mean...

615
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,189
It's been tough.

616
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,525
- Well, brother,
marriage ain't easy.

617
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,094
- [chuckles] It's like,
take your eye off the road,

618
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,296
you're gonna hit a speed bump
every now and then, right?

619
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,931
- No doubt.
- Just gotta keep moving on.

620
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,299
You know?
- For sure.

621
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,634
- But, I think
she'll come back.

622
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,871
- Well, pssh,
bro, for sure.

623
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:08,941
- [sniffles]
I mean she's got to, right?

624
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,110
[sobbing, sniffling]

625
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,916
- Tell me one thing.
- Yeah.

626
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,686
- When they gonna bring
Big Play Slay into the game?

627
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,688
- [chuckles]
- I mean, he gets it done.

628
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:25,858
He always does, right?
- Right? Yeah.

629
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,628
Ice. Dripping.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.

630
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,596
Ah!

631
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:33,232
- It's a good play, finally.
- Yes. One stop.

632
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,639
- Dude.
- Can they even do that?

633
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,208
- Isn't there some kind of,
like, HR protocol or something?

634
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,711
- [snickers]
It's a diner, not Microsoft.

635
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:49,015
- So unfair.
What did Stan say?

636
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,216
- I can't tell Stan.

637
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,718
- Oh, honey.

638
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,653
- Not when we're this
deep underwater.

639
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,623
I just--you know, I gotta get
something else going first.

640
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:59,358
- Well, good news is
there are plenty of other

641
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,128
extremely depressing
and unpleasant jobs out there.

642
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,230
Right?
[chuckles]

643
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,331
What?
I'm just--

644
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,733
I'm just saying, you know.

645
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,669
You want fun,
you rob a grocery store.

646
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:10,603
- Hey!

647
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,840
- You don't work
minimum wage.

dear Kenny *

- Yeah, whoo, whoo, whoo!
Happy birthday, buddy.

652
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,356
- Don't forget to make a wish.

653
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,292
- I wish that Daddy
could live at home again.

654
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,798
- Okay.

655
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,932
Got anything else?

656
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,868
- Come on,
blow out the candles, baby.

00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,105

- Excuse me.

663
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,321
- Daddy, Daddy.
Daddy, Daddy?

664
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,991
- Hey, does, um...
- Daddy.

665
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:09,228
- Does Mommy ever
have any, like, you know,

666
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,197
new friends come over?

667
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,431
- Just a man in bed.

668
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,802
I'm not supposed to
tell you that.

669
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,369
- Huh.

670
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,206
[electronic dance music]

671
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,041
- You can't just walk in here.

672
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,209
- The door was open.

673
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,677
- It's because
I'm having a party

674
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,412
with children
and their parents.

675
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,749
Oh, my God, you brought a gun?
Of course you brought a gun.

676
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,183
- Is this your husband?
- Yes.

677
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,319
- What's he do?
- He sells cars.

678
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,721
- Is he good at it?

679
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:38,057
- [stammers]
Why does that matter?

680
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,861
- Yeah, he don't look too
trustworthy to me.

681
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,833
- What do you want?

682
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,234
What do you want?

683
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,137
- Came to pick up my boy.

684
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,005
- That's hilarious.

685
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,406
He's not here.

686
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,409
And by the way, when he left,
he held me at gunpoint,

687
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,746
and then stole my car.

688
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,749
So I'm gonna need
payment for that too.

689
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,184
- Oh, I'm sorry, what payment?
- Excuse me.

690
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,986
- Yeah, you get paid
when you do a job.

691
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,821
Did--did you do a job?

692
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:12,391
- He left.
- Then that's on you.

693
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,894
- What am I supposed to do?
Chain him to a bed?

694
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,363
- Oh, baby, what you think
this is, little league?

695
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,799
And you get a trophy
just for playing?

696
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,868
- I tried.

697
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,403
- I don't give
a damn if you try.

698
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,073
You gotta win, bitch.

699
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,078
- Beth, you--
you okay?

700
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:35,314
- Fine, yeah.
Fine.

701
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,316
[distant chatter]

702
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,956
- Cars, huh?

703
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,496
- Bye, guys, see you later.

704
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,033
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me.

705
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,768
- Hey, have we met before?

706
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,136
- Nah, I don't think so.

707
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,504
- You look so familiar.

708
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,974
- Nah, just a friend
of the family.

709
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:04,043
[chatter]

710
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,848
- I'm coming.
Thank you so much.

711
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,457
all: One, two, three,
atom bomb!

712
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,927
Oh!
[laughter]

713
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,229
One more time.
Let's go, come on.

714
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,231
[laughter]

715
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,933
- Okay, ready?

716
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,167
All right, go.

717
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,103
One, two...

718
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,172
- Atom bomb.

719
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,874
- Mmm.

720
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,146
- Hope you didn't
pop the bounce house,

721
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,081
'cause I gotta return that.

722
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,351
- That thing is awesome.

723
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,454
[clears throat]
So...

724
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,357
who's your new friend?

725
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,094
- What?

726
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,930
- You know, the guy
with the throat tats.

727
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,201
- Oh, he dropped off
the bounce house.

728
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,470
- Hmm, you were fighting
with the bounce house guy

729
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,840
in our bedroom?

730
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,408
- It's really none
of your business.

731
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,543
- Emma says he sleeps over.

732
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,412
- Oh, well, Emma also
thinks the Easter Bunny

733
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:14,947
sleeps in her closet, so...

734
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,983
- Is he the reason
you're not wearing your ring?

735
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,418
- Oh, my God.
- What? I have a right to know.

736
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,220
- You lost your right

737
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,390
when you stuck your penis
in your secretary.

738
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,958
- Come on.
- I want you out.

739
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,526
- What?
- Yeah, I want you gone now.

740
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,228
- No, it's Kenny's
birthday party.

741
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,464
- Kenny's birthday party is
over, and I am exhausted,

742
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,133
and I would like to put
the kids to bed.

743
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,468
- It's my house too, Beth.
- The hell it is.

744
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,937
- And you're still my wife,
so...

745
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,873
- Yeah.
I gotta get on that.

746
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:42,241
- Oh, yeah?
What does that mean?

747
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,177
- What do you think it means?

748
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,146
- Hey, you guys,
it's time to come in.

749
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,915
- Beth, please.
- Guys, time for bed.

750
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,549
- Can we just sit down
and talk for a second?

751
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,885
- I don't have
anything to say.

752
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,320
Guys!
- Just wait.

753
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,255
- What, Dean?
What?

754
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:59,125
- I just--
- What?

755
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,895
- I have cancer.

756
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,565
[laughter]

757
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,467
children: Atom bomb!

758
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,569
- Atom bomb, atom bomb.

759
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:19,979
.

760
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:20,679
- What am I gonna
tell the kids?

761
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,551
- I don't know.

762
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,387
- How are we gonna
pay for it?

763
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,489
- I don't know.

764
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,625
- What if he's really,
really sick?

765
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,062
[whimpers]

766
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,997
- We'll get
through it together.

767
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,232
- How do you know that?

768
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:43,970
- 'Cause we always do.

769
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,372
- When did life become
this big monster

770
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,241
that we just have to
constantly feed?

771
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,510
- All right there,
little Nietzsche,

772
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,679
go back to sleep, okay?

773
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,382
- I can't, I have to return
all that stuff.

774
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,951
- Don't worry about that.
I'll do it.

775
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,452
Where's the receipt?

776
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:04,523
- In my purse.
- Okay.

777
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,093
- I can't believe I spent
ten grand on a party.

778
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,560
- [chuckles]

779
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,531
Did you see that
little kid's face?

780
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,501
You're an amazing,
amazing mother.

781
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,605
- So are you.

782
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,707
- Besides, all that stuff
is getting returned,

783
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,110
so it doesn't matter.

784
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,711
- [sniffles]

785
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,714
[pensive music]

786
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:34,486
*

787
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,055
- Can you make breakfast?

788
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:39,558
- Hmm, well, that depends.
What'd you have in mind?

789
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,294
- My mommy usually
makes crepes.

790
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,997
- Well, Auntie's
specialty is cereal.

791
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,299
Mmm.

792
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,168
Hey, go inside
really quick, okay?

793
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,570
I'll be right there.
Go on.

794
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,343
- Yo.

795
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,481
Thanks for loaning me the whip.

796
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,484
- What did you do to it?

797
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,319
- Yeah, sorry about that.

798
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,155
- My sister drives that
to carpool

799
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,590
- I filled up the tank.

800
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,559
Things got a little out
of hand, so I mean,

801
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,062
I owe you all some time,
for real.

802
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,770
[upbeat music]

*

804
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,207
- Hey, do you need a ride?

805
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,209
- * They say they coming for
you but I don't want none *

806
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,777
* 'Cause I really
don't care... *

807
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,479
- Get the pudding.

808
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,082
Ooh.
- Ah.

809
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,250
- * This may be communism
but I tell you this is mine *

810
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,186
- Oh.
[chuckling]

811
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,587
[indistinct chatter]

812
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,655
- * What, what you've
been thinking *

813
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,457
- Oh.

814
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,825
- * I set it off

815
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,429
* What, what you've
been thinking *

816
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,099
- Yo, what's for lunch?

817
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:57,536
*

818
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,105
What you got?

819
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,507
- Just, like,
a veggie medley?

820
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,344
*

821
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,114

to lose a few, huh?

*

823
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,784
So which one of y'all
little bitches

824
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,454
likes to pull
pants down?

825
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:19,258
You?
How about you, Porky?

826
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,693
I said, who is it?

827
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,795
- Are you kidding?
- I'm sorry.

828
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,365
- Here's how this is gonna go.

829
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,799
You pull pants down ever again,

830
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,802
I'm gonna break every bone
in your body.

831
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:33,472
- [scoffs]
Yeah, right.

832
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,807
Wait till he finds out
who my dad is.

833
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,144

[whimpers]

835
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,282
- What was that
about your dad?

836
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,752
I couldn't hear it over the
sound of your bones snapping.

837
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,687
Next time it's your thumb.

838
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,291
And you never
rat out your boy.

839
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,793
Snitches get stitches.

840
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,562
- * Now carry on

841

[door clanks]

843
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,807
- Agent Turner.

844
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,776
- Where you been?
I've missed you.

845
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,711
- Oh, really?
- No, sarcasm.

846
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,213
- Look, I just wanna
show you one thing.

847
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,748
- Leslie--
- Will you just take a look?

848
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,550
Okay, I saw this guy, okay?

849
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,219
He was with the three
of them before.

850
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,454
And saw him again yesterday.

851
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:25,657
Whatever they're into,
he's involved.

852
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,929
- Text it to me.
- Really?

853
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,863
Okay, great.

854
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,632
Um, uh, what's our next move?

855
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,636
- Just text it, Leslie.
- I could go undercover.

856
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,206
You know, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

857
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,342
"Donnie Brasco"
is my favorite movie.

858
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,345
[percussive music]

859
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:53,585
*

860

*

861
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,267
- ...at the very core of
our democratic system is...

862
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,636
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

863
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,639
- I mean, it's kind of awesome.
- Yeah.

864
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,874
- And then it does take
a pretty dark turn.

865
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,545
- Yeah, believe me, I did not
know he was gonna do that.

866
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,380
I just tried to scare him
a little bit.

867
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,915
- Where did you find this guy?

868
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,917
- Uh, at work.

869
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,753
- So much for
background checks.

870
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,821
- [chuckles]
Right?

871
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,991
- Oh.

872
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,794
- My opponent makes the point
that the electoral system

873
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,530
of democracy negates the need
for civil disobedience,

874
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,798
however...

875
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,700
- I feel like she
really thinks she's in front

876
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,569
of the Supreme Court right now.

877
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,537
- Yeah, she's pretty amazing.

878
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,938
- Duh.

879
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,775
- Wait, wait,
where are the teachers?

880
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,344
- Lucky for us,
apparently this school is, uh,

881
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,945
pretty understaffed.

882
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,283
- You know, at St. Anne's I bet
you they'd just expel a kid

883
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,785
if he pulled
someone's pants down.

884
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,388
- Yeah, and they also
use the Bible

885
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,589
as their science textbook.

886
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,758
- [sighs]

887
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,860
- God, why do you
have to do that?

888
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,996
- What?
- Just, like--

889
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,565
You know, we were actually
having a nice moment.

890
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,302
We were like vibing.
- Vibing?

891
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,337
- Oh, I'm sorry,
we were "getting along."

892
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,471
Whatever.

893
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:20,606
Then you just say
something stupid

894
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,607
and you ruin it
every time.

895
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,309
- All right, I'm sorry,

896
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:24,676
I'm just saying that I feel
like she would be happier

897
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,811
at a place like--

898
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,613
- Yes, I know what you feel,
okay?

899
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,581
You've made that abundantly
clear, thanks.

900
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,583
- I'm not just talking
about her.

901
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,286
- Oh--oh,
you're doing this for me?

902
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,787
- You're killing yourself
trying to support her.

903
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,489

okay, you know what?

904

I really appreciate it, Greg.

905

Thank you so much
for looking out for me.

906
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,294
That's just so
sweet of you.

907
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,395
Just so you know,

908
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,731
I have some pretty dope stuff
in the works right now.

909
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,466

Yeah, like what?

910

you'll see.

* Good morning

916
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,992
- See, that's why they're gonna
put us in assisted living

917
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,928
when we're old.

918
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:17,896
- Okay.

919
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,398
- Where you going, early bird?

920
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,601
- Um, I picked up a few
extra shifts this week.

921
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,669
- That's my girl.

922
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,337
- Do you mind
holding it down?

923
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:28,607
Probably be late a lot.
- Psh, I got these people.

924
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,577
- Okay.
- Oh, hold on.

925
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,811
- Oh, yeah.

926
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,614
- I'm proud of you.
- For what?

927
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,649
- Sucking it up.
I know it wasn't fun.

928
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,619
- Oh, you know,
they go low, we go high.

929

Bye, baby.

930

- Okay.

a business proposition.

935

- Aw, you guys didn't
hit me up to do brunch?

936
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,374
- To clean your fake money
without having to deal

937
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:05,076
with drug dealers
or street people.

938
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,447
- Street people?

939
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,748
- I got a system.

940
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:10,816
- It's a liability.

941
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,083
- It gets the job done.

942
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:16,422
- How'd your friend
get shot again?

943
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:21,092
- What're you proposing?
- Let us do it right here.

944
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,562
- You wanna clean
fake cash here?

945
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,996
- Or any big box retailer.

946
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,865
You know, Walmart, Costco.

947
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,700
They have very generous
return policies.

948
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,036
- And no one thinks twice
about a wife buying her husband

949
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,973
a flat screen TV
or new tires for the minivan.

950
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,975
- We trade it all in
for fresh cash.

951
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:40,712
- Fake money in,
real money out.

What's in it for you?

00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,758
- 20% cut of the profit.

956

- Oh, is that right?
[chuckles]

957
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,695
There anything else
while we're at it?

958
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,431
Y'all want health care?
Union breaks?

959
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:00,832
- Just for the record,

960
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,435
I'll never smuggle anything
up my butt.

961
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:07,205
- I could be talked into it
if the compensation was

962
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,974
appropriate--wait.
Where are you going?

963
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,910
- Uh, I gotta go
buy a duvet cover.

964
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,447
- Are you in or...?

965
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:17,549
- We'll give it a try.

966

- We're not here to try,
we're here to win, bitch.

*

Just playing Dr. Google
and freaking myself out.

- Yeah, right.

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,194
- When will you know more?

981
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:07,265
- I got a bunch of scans
and tests next week.

00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,938
Well, I'll go with you.

- You don't have to.
But that would be great.

Um, hey,

986
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,216
I just wanna say thanks
for letting me come home.

okay in here?

Kenny's psyched,
so am I.

00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:37,796
I get to sleep on the top bunk.

- Uh, I--better go get that.

992
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,567

Hey, Bethie.
