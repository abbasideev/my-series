00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:17,611
- We can do it.

181
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,743
- [softly] Can we?
- You don't get more time.

182
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,266
- It's not a problem.

183
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,138
- [softly] It isn't?

184
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:29,405
- Go big or go home, right?

185
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,154
- Brought that mama van
with you?

186
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,550
Load 'em up.

187
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,518
- Go big or go home?

188
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:58,129
- I don't know, it's something
Kenny's coach always says.

189
00:07:58,173 --> 00:07:59,609
- Yeah, when he says it,

190
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,916
he means home as in your house,

191
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,961
not the big house.

192
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,354
- Okay.

193
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,269
- What were you thinking?

194
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,662
- I was thinking
about our future.

195
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,099
We didn't come
all this way to just quit.

196
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,188
I robbed a grocery store.

197
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,406
I didn't do it for nothing.

198
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,800
- God, when did you
get so cool?

199
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,499
- You guys, we can do this.

200
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,849
We just need some extra hands.

201
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,940
- You want to bring
other people into this now?

202
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,682
- We've got a system
that works.

203
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,988
If we could just do it
on a bigger scale.

204
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:34,035
- What if they get caught?
- They won't.

205
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,993
We haven't.

206
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,213
This cash is that good.

207
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,650
- So what?

208
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,130
I just ask...

209
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:45,002
Harry's Spanish teacher
if she wants a side hustle?

210
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,614
- I mean, she probably does.
Teachers make next to nothing.

211
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:50,573
- We know tons of women
who could use extra cash.

212
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,444
- This isn't Mary Kay.

213
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,403
You can't just serve
a bitch a mini-muffin

214
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,884
and invite her to join you
in a life of crime.

215
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:02,367
- What if they didn't know
it was a crime?

216
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,587
[lively instrumental music]

217
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,502
- So what's a secret shopper?

218
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,592
- Well, stores hire companies
like the ones we work for

219
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,507
to send in people
to pretend to be shoppers.

220
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,553
- That way they can tell
how good or bad

221
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,119
the customer service is.

222
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,338
- Mini-muffin?
- Yes.

223
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,774
- So you'll pay us

224
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,820
to buy a bunch of stuff
and then return it?

225
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,648
- They're mostly interested
in the customer experience.

226
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,519
So every time
you make a return,

227
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,522
you feel out a survey
and you get paid.

228
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
- It's that easy.
[laughs] Crazy, right?

229
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,134
- [chuckles awkwardly]
So crazy.

230
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,571
- How long does a survey
have to be?

231
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,050
- Oh, that's entirely
up to you.

232
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,486
- Do we get reimbursed
for mileage?

233
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,618
- Good question.
- I will definitely

234
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,315
bring that up with corporate.

235
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,622
- [mouthing "Corporate?"]
- Well, I, uh,

236
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,581
I have to ask my husband.

237
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,540
- Oh, Henry will freak if this
takes me away from the kids.

238
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,760
- I should talk to mine too.
- No, no. No, no.

239
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,413
- Mine, too.
- It's called secret shoppers.

240
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,633
Got to stay secret.
- And, you guys,

241
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,331
this isn't about your husband
or your kids.

242
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,333
I mean...

243
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:56,683
I get it.

244
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,380
You feel like you've got
to put everyone

245
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:01,513
in front of you, right?
But you don't.

246
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,646
We are giving you
an opportunity

247
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,866
to make your own money.

248
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,738
To do something just
for yourself.

249
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:12,960
This is about being
a strong, independent woman.

250
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:14,265
- I'm--I'm not a woman.

251
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,745
- I think you guys are
getting a little

252
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,791
caught up in the details.
- Yeah.

253
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,967
- I don't have all the answers,

254
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,100
but I will tell you this.

255
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:26,234
Ever since I started this,

256
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:29,846
my perspective has changed
entirely.

257
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,022
- Ain't that the truth.
- You guys,

258
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,763
we're in this together.

259
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,983
I mean, when women support
other women,

260
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,941
incredible things happen.

261
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,295
- Plus the shopper of the year
gets a new Corvette.

262
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,601
- What?
both: A Corvette?

263
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,516
- Why didn't you say that?

264
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,780
[excited chatter]

265
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,391
- Oh, they'll never remember.

266
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:56,133
[indistinct chatter]

267
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,483
[laughter]

268
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,795
- It's, uh, Agent Turner,
right?

269
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,667
- Jimmy.
- You in the market?

270
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,278
'Cause we got some sweet deals.
What are you driving now?

271
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,019
- An unmarked
government-issued sedan.

272
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,978
- [laughing]
Well, that's--that's no fun.

273
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,153
Go ahead and take a ride.

274
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,415
- The bureau
doesn't like flashy.

275
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,417
- I'm pretty sure
that J. Edgar Hoover

276
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,724
used to rock
a feather boa.

277
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,727
All right, well,

278
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,163
so what can I help you with?

279
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,078
- Well I'm hoping
we can help each other.

280
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,515
Cops found that SUV
you reported stolen.

281
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,691
- They did?
Where?

282
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,475
- Bottom of Cedar Lake.

283
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,520
- Hm.
Was there an accident?

284
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,044
- No.
- [chuckles]

285
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,567
Who steals a car to sink it?

286
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,829
- I have no idea.

287
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,310
You know who might though?
- Who?

288
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,964
- Your wife.

289
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,969
Maybe we should step
into your office, Mr. Boland.

290
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:53,190
.

291
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,845
[lunch bag crinkling]

292
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,848
[television playing]

293
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,503
- That better not be
Halloween candy, mister.

294
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,767
- My science teacher says that
chocolate's good for the heart.

295
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,638
- Ready, Mama!
- What's with you and pants?

296
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,205
Are you just morally
opposed to pants?

297
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,120
Are you on a pants strike?
- No pants!

298
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,253
- Where are my shin guards?
- Probably in dad's car.

299
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,645
- Dad?

300
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,125
- Dean?
- [snaps fingers]

301
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,518
- Huh?
- Shin guards.

302
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,172
[laughter]
- Oh, uh,

303
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,695
I'll look.

304
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,044
- You feeling okay?

305
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,872
- What's on tap for you today?

306
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,222
- Carpool, cleaners,
grocery store.

307
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,789
The usual.

308
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:28,704
- Is that it?

309
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,316
- It's tuna fish--
both: Keep it in the fridge.

310
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,753
- Yeah.

311
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,411
- All right, everyone,
let's go, let's go!

312
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:41,717
Emma!

313
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,806
Hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off.

314
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,549
- Thank you.
Have a fine and frugal day.

315
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:48,811
Ma'am, I'm ready if you are.

316
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,945
- Oh, they never carry
the mints I like.

317
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,903
Do I know you?

318
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:56,558
- Uh, no, no, I'm not--
- Nana.

319
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,951
What are you doing here?

320
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,388
I would have brought
the ham salad to you.

321
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,002
- It is you.
- Oh, my God, it is.

322
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:09,789
- I didn't know you worked
with my Leslie.

323
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,356
She works
for Social Services too.

324
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,619
- Well, it's really more
of a volunteer

325
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,012
kind of a thing,
you know, but--

326
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,579
- She and all her friends

327
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,799
cleaned my whole apartment.

328
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,803
- Yeah.
I bet they did.

329
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,110
- She's a very sweet girl,
Leslie.

330
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:30,026
- Oh, yeah.
Big heart, this one.

331
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,767
- No, it's funny
you didn't mention

332
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,422
Fine and Frugal
when you came over.

333
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,946
- Oh, uh--
- That is funny, Annie.

334
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,818
Now, why do you think that is?

335
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,081
- Hm.
Uh, I don't know, Leslie.

336
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,431
Maybe it's just because
your nana and I

337
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,781
had so much to talk about.
- Oh [chuckles]

338
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,263
- For example, how is
your fiancée, Jessica Alba?

339
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:52,135
- Oh, I showed her
that beautiful picture.

340
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,443
- Fine, yeah.
No, things are fine.

341
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:58,185
- Yeah? Now, she's in
LA though, right? Ugh.

342
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:01,841
Must be really tough,
you know, the distance.

343
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,409
- We make it work.

344
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:06,454
- Glad to hear it.

345
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:08,325
- You know,
you left so abruptly

346
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:11,676
that night, I was hoping
you'd come back again.

347
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,809
- Oh, I wanted to Marion.

348
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,812
Really, I just--I've been
so busy lately, you know?

349
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,684
- Yeah, Annie has a whole life
outside of this store, Nana.

350
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:22,426
You would be real shocked.

351
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:27,867
- It was just nice to have
someone to talk to.

They soak you in lye,
and they make you into soup.

405
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,727
And then the cops can't tell
if you used to be a human

or a large dog.

407
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,297

408

oil drums are real small.

- And how do we replace
the 20 grand?

414
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,404
- We stiff our secret shoppers
instead.

- At least we don't

- Yeah, and it wouldn't
be enough.

419
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,457
We would have to dip
into our profits to cover it,

420
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,459

us back where we started.

And then I was too embarrassed
to ask again.

- Well, we can't ask again.
- No.

in this park.

everything out.

have had my head examined

tell you.

what we could do with this?

some of Raymond's nice bourbon.
